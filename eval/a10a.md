### Legal Analysis of the Scenario

#### 1. Identification of Legal Issues

The primary legal issues in this scenario are:
1. **Contract Formation**: Whether a contract was formed between the parrot's owners and either Jack or Imogen for the reward.
2. **Entitlement to Reward**: Whether Jack or Imogen is entitled to the reward based on the actions they took and their knowledge of the reward offer.

#### 2. Applicable Laws

The relevant legal principles and case law in this scenario include:
1. **Offer and Acceptance**: For a contract to be formed, there must be an offer, acceptance, consideration, and an intention to create legal relations.
2. **Unilateral Contracts**: A unilateral contract involves a promise in exchange for an act. The offeror is bound to pay the reward once the act is performed.
3. **Knowledge of the Offer**: The offeree must have knowledge of the offer at the time of performing the act to claim the reward.

Relevant case law includes:
- **Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co [1893] 1 QB 256**: This case established that a unilateral offer can be accepted by anyone who performs the conditions stated in the offer.
- **Gibbons v Proctor [1891] 64 LT 594**: This case held that a person who performs the conditions of a reward offer without knowledge of the offer cannot claim the reward.

#### 3. Application of Law to Facts

**Contract Formation and Unilateral Contracts:**

- **Offer**: The parrot's owners made a unilateral offer by posting notices offering a Â£1,000 reward for information leading to the recovery of the bird.
- **Acceptance**: Acceptance of a unilateral contract occurs when the act specified in the offer is performed.

**Knowledge of the Offer:**

- **Imogen**: At the time Imogen found the parrot and locked it in her greenhouse, she was unaware of the reward offer. According to **Gibbons v Proctor**, she cannot claim the reward because she did not perform the act with knowledge of the offer.
- **Jack**: Jack knew about the reward when he reported the parrot's location to Wilf. However, Jack did not personally find or secure the parrot; he merely relayed information provided by Imogen.

**Entitlement to Reward:**

- **Imogen's Claim**: Imogen cannot claim the reward because she did not know about the offer when she found the parrot. Her actions were not performed in response to the offer.
- **Jack's Claim**: Jack knew about the reward and reported the parrot's location. However, the owners argue that Jack did not contribute to the recovery of the bird. The key question is whether providing information (even if obtained from someone else) constitutes sufficient performance of the conditions of the offer.

**Consideration and Intention to Create Legal Relations:**

- **Consideration**: The consideration for the reward is the act of providing information leading to the recovery of the bird.
- **Intention**: The owners' public posting of the reward indicates an intention to create legal relations with anyone who performs the specified act.

#### Conclusion

- **Imogen**: Based on **Gibbons v Proctor**, Imogen is not entitled to the reward because she did not know about the offer when she found the parrot.
- **Jack**: Jack may have a stronger claim because he knew about the reward and provided the information. However, the owners' refusal to pay suggests they do not believe Jack's actions meet the conditions of the offer. If the matter were to be litigated, a court would need to determine whether Jack's act of reporting the parrot's location, based on information from Imogen, constitutes sufficient performance of the offer's conditions.

In summary, Imogen has no legal claim to the reward, while Jack's claim is arguable but not guaranteed. The outcome would depend on a court's interpretation of whether Jack's actions fulfilled the conditions of the unilateral offer.
