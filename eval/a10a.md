### (a) Legal Rights and Obligations in Relation to the Lease

#### Legal Issues:
1. **Exercise of the Option to Renew the Lease**: Whether X-Treme Learning validly exercised the option to renew the lease despite the landlord not receiving the written notice.
2. **Rent Reduction Agreement**: Whether the landlord's offer of a 30% rent reduction for one year is enforceable.

#### Applicable Laws:
1. **Contract Law**: Principles of offer, acceptance, and consideration.
2. **Landlord and Tenant Law**: Specific provisions related to lease renewals and rent adjustments.

#### Analysis:

1. **Exercise of the Option to Renew the Lease**:
   - **Contractual Requirement**: The lease agreement required X-Treme Learning to exercise the option to renew "by notice in writing."
   - **Postal Rule**: Under common law, the postal rule states that acceptance is effective when the letter is posted, not when it is received (Adams v Lindsell [1818]).
   - **Application**: Vincent posted the letter in April 2021, which would typically mean the option was exercised at that point. However, the letter never reached the landlord, raising the issue of whether the postal rule applies in this context.
   - **Conduct of Parties**: X-Treme Learning continued to occupy the premises and made regular rental payments, which the landlord accepted. This conduct may imply that both parties treated the lease as renewed.

2. **Rent Reduction Agreement**:
   - **Offer and Acceptance**: The landlord offered a 30% rent reduction if the option to renew was exercised. Vincent accepted this offer by posting the renewal letter.
   - **Consideration**: The consideration for the rent reduction is the renewal of the lease.
   - **Enforceability**: The landlord's subsequent acceptance of rent payments at the reduced rate may indicate that the rent reduction agreement was in effect, even if not formally documented.

#### Conclusion:
X-Treme Learning likely has a valid claim that the lease was renewed and that the rent reduction agreement is enforceable. The landlord's acceptance of rent payments and the continued occupation of the premises support this position.

### (b) Legal Claims by Students and Defenses Available

#### Legal Issues:
1. **Misrepresentation**: Whether the promotional materials misrepresented the terms of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion.
2. **Breach of Contract**: Whether X-Treme Learning breached the contract by not providing Vincent as the instructor and by requiring both compulsory and optional homework for the promotion.

#### Applicable Laws:
1. **Misrepresentation**: Principles of misrepresentation under contract law.
2. **Contract Law**: Terms and conditions, including implied terms and express terms.
3. **Consumer Protection**: Relevant consumer protection laws that may apply to misleading advertisements.

#### Analysis:

1. **Misrepresentation**:
   - **Promotional Materials**: The advertisements prominently featured Vincent and did not clearly state the terms and conditions, which could be seen as misleading.
   - **Small Print**: The small print stating that terms and conditions applied may not be sufficient to negate the impression given by the main advertisement.
   - **Legal Standard**: Under common law, a misrepresentation is a false statement of fact that induces a party to enter into a contract (Derry v Peek [1889]).

2. **Breach of Contract**:
   - **Instructor Availability**: The welcome booklet stated that the availability of any one instructor was not guaranteed, which may protect X-Treme Learning from claims related to Vincent's absence.
   - **Homework Requirements**: The booklet specified that both compulsory and optional homework had to be completed. However, if students were misled by the promotional materials, they might argue that the terms were not adequately communicated.
   - **Consumer Protection**: Under consumer protection laws, businesses must not engage in misleading or deceptive conduct. The promotional materials could be scrutinized under these laws.

#### Defenses:
1. **Clear Terms in Welcome Booklet**: X-Treme Learning can argue that the terms were clearly stated in the welcome booklet, which students received upon enrollment.
2. **No Guarantee of Instructor**: The booklet explicitly stated that the availability of any one instructor was not guaranteed, which may absolve X-Treme Learning of liability for Vincent's absence.
3. **Compliance with Terms**: X-Treme Learning can argue that students were required to complete both compulsory and optional homework as per the terms provided in the welcome booklet.

#### Conclusion:
Students may have claims for misrepresentation and breach of contract. However, X-Treme Learning has potential defenses based on the clear terms provided in the welcome booklet and the explicit disclaimer regarding instructor availability. The success of student claims will depend on whether the court finds the promotional materials to be misleading and whether the terms in the welcome booklet were sufficiently communicated.
