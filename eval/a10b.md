### Legal Analysis of the Scenario

#### 1. Identification of Legal Issues

The scenario presents several legal issues related to the claim for the reward money:

1. **Formation of a Unilateral Contract**: Whether the reward offer constitutes a unilateral contract and whether Imogen or Jack can claim the reward.
2. **Knowledge of the Reward**: Whether Imogen's lack of knowledge of the reward at the time of finding the parrot affects her entitlement.
3. **Performance of the Conditions**: Whether Jack's actions in reporting the parrot's location fulfill the conditions of the reward offer.
4. **Entitlement to the Reward**: Whether Imogen or Jack, or both, are entitled to the reward money.

#### 2. Applicable Laws

The applicable laws and principles include:

1. **Contract Law**: Specifically, the principles governing unilateral contracts.
2. **Case Law**: Relevant case law such as *Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co* [1893] 1 QB 256, which deals with unilateral contracts and the requirements for acceptance.
3. **Legislation**: While there is no specific Hong Kong legislation directly addressing reward claims, general principles of contract law as applied in Hong Kong's common law system will be relevant.

#### 3. Application of Law to Facts

**Formation of a Unilateral Contract**

A unilateral contract is formed when one party makes a promise in exchange for the performance of an act by another party. The offeror is bound to pay the reward once the act is performed.

- **Offer**: The restaurant owners made an offer by advertising a Â£1,000 reward for information leading to the recovery of the parrot.
- **Acceptance**: Acceptance of a unilateral contract is through the performance of the act specified in the offer.

**Knowledge of the Reward**

For a claimant to be entitled to a reward, they must generally have knowledge of the reward offer at the time they perform the act.

- **Imogen's Knowledge**: Imogen found the parrot and locked it in her greenhouse without knowledge of the reward. According to the principle established in *Gibbons v Proctor* [1891] 64 LT 594, a person who performs the act without knowledge of the reward offer is generally not entitled to the reward.
- **Jack's Knowledge**: Jack knew of the reward when he reported the parrot's location to Wilf. However, he did not find the parrot himself.

**Performance of the Conditions**

The conditions of the reward offer were to provide information leading to the recovery of the parrot.

- **Imogen's Actions**: Imogen found and secured the parrot, which is a significant part of the act required by the reward offer.
- **Jack's Actions**: Jack reported the parrot's location to Wilf, which led to the recovery of the parrot.

**Entitlement to the Reward**

- **Imogen's Claim**: Imogen's initial lack of knowledge of the reward offer weakens her claim. However, her actions were crucial in the recovery of the parrot.
- **Jack's Claim**: Jack knew of the reward and provided the information that led to the recovery. However, he did not find the parrot himself.

**Case Law Application**

- **Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co**: This case established that a unilateral contract is formed when the offeree performs the act specified in the offer. The offeror is bound to pay the reward once the act is performed.
- **Gibbons v Proctor**: This case suggests that knowledge of the reward offer is necessary for a valid claim.

**Conclusion**

- **Imogen**: While Imogen's actions were crucial, her lack of knowledge of the reward at the time of finding the parrot may disqualify her from claiming the reward based on *Gibbons v Proctor*. However, she could argue that her subsequent knowledge and the fact that her actions were essential to the recovery should entitle her to at least part of the reward.
- **Jack**: Jack knew of the reward and provided the information that led to the recovery. However, his claim may be weakened by the fact that he did not find the parrot himself.

**Recommendation**

- **Imogen**: Imogen should argue that her actions were essential to the recovery and that her subsequent knowledge of the reward should entitle her to a share of the reward.
- **Jack**: Jack should argue that he fulfilled the conditions of the reward offer by providing the information that led to the recovery.

Ultimately, the resolution may depend on the interpretation of the reward offer and the specific facts of the case. Both Imogen and Jack have arguments that could be made in their favor, and a court may need to determine the appropriate distribution of the reward money.
