### Legal Analysis of the Scenario

#### (a) Legal Rights and Obligations in Relation to the Lease

**Legal Issues:**
1. Whether X-Treme Learning validly exercised the option to renew the lease.
2. The effect of the landlord's offer to reduce the rent by 30% for one year.
3. The implications of X-Treme Learning continuing to occupy the premises and making regular rental payments.

**Applicable Laws:**
1. **Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance (Cap. 7)**
   - Section 119L: Endorsement of tenancy agreement.
   - Section 120AAZE: Renewed rent for second term.
   - Section 120AAW: Deemed second term offer by landlord.

2. **Case Law:**
   - **Finch v Underwood (1876) 2 Ch D 310**: Strict compliance with conditions precedent for exercising an option to renew.
   - **Mannai Investment Co Ltd v Eagle Star Life Assurance Co Ltd [1997] AC 749**: Objective interpretation of notices.
   - **Best Fashion Management Co Ltd v Star Play Development Limited [2002] 1 HKC 708**: Interpretation of contractual notices.

**Application of Law to Facts:**

1. **Exercise of the Option to Renew:**
   - The lease agreement required the option to be exercised "by notice in writing." Vincent posted the letter in April 2021, but it never reached the landlord.
   - According to **Finch v Underwood**, strict compliance with the conditions precedent is required. The notice did not reach the landlord, so technically, the option was not validly exercised.
   - However, under **Mannai Investment Co Ltd v Eagle Star Life Assurance Co Ltd**, the court may consider the objective intention behind the notice. Vincent's intention to renew was clear, and the landlord's subsequent actions (e.g., offering a rent reduction) indicate acknowledgment of the renewal.

2. **Landlord's Offer to Reduce Rent:**
   - The landlord offered a 30% reduction on the rent for one year if the option to renew was exercised. This offer was conditional on the renewal.
   - Since the landlord acknowledged the renewal by offering the reduction and later demanding the full rent, it can be argued that the landlord waived strict compliance with the notice requirement.

3. **Continued Occupation and Rent Payments:**
   - X-Treme Learning continued to occupy the premises and made regular rental payments. This conduct can be seen as an implied acceptance of the renewal terms.
   - Under **Section 120AAW** of the Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance, if the landlord fails to serve a second term offer, the tenant is deemed to have accepted the offer, and the tenancy is renewed.
   - The landlord's letter in December 2021 demanding the full rent from January 2022 further supports the renewal of the lease.

**Conclusion:**
X-Treme Learning has a strong argument that the lease was validly renewed, either through the landlord's acknowledgment and conduct or through the deemed acceptance provisions under the Ordinance. The full rent of $240,000 is due starting January 2022, as per the landlord's notification.

#### (b) Legal Claims by Students and Defenses Available

**Legal Issues:**
1. Misrepresentation in the "5 Or Nothing" promotion.
2. Breach of contract regarding the quality of teaching and the availability of Vincent.
3. Ambiguity in the terms and conditions of the promotion.

**Applicable Laws:**
1. **Misrepresentation Ordinance (Cap. 284)**
   - Section 3: Remedies for misrepresentation.
2. **Contract Law Principles:**
   - **Mannai Investment Co Ltd v Eagle Star Life Assurance Co Ltd [1997] AC 749**: Objective interpretation of contractual terms.
   - **Inchcape NRG H.K. Ltd v Hotel Amenities International Ltd [2000]**: Misrepresentation by omission.

**Application of Law to Facts:**

1. **Misrepresentation:**
   - The "5 Or Nothing" promotion was advertised prominently, but the terms and conditions were in small print and not easily accessible.
   - Students may claim that the promotion was misleading, as the requirement to complete both compulsory and optional homework was not clearly communicated.
   - Under **Inchcape NRG H.K. Ltd v Hotel Amenities International Ltd**, failure to disclose material terms can constitute misrepresentation by omission.

2. **Breach of Contract:**
   - Students enrolled expecting Vincent to teach the mathematics classes. His sudden illness and replacement by a less experienced tutor could be seen as a breach of the implied term of quality.
   - The booklet stated that the availability of any one instructor was not guaranteed, which may provide a defense for X-Treme Learning.
   - However, the premium rates charged for Vincent's classes could imply a higher standard of teaching, leading to potential claims for breach of contract.

3. **Ambiguity in Terms and Conditions:**
   - The requirement to complete both compulsory and optional homework was not clearly stated in the promotional materials.
   - Under **Mannai Investment Co Ltd v Eagle Star Life Assurance Co Ltd**, the court will interpret the terms objectively. The ambiguity may be resolved against X-Treme Learning, as the drafter of the terms.

**Defenses Available:**
1. **Disclosure of Terms:**
   - X-Treme Learning can argue that the terms and conditions were provided in the welcome booklet, which students received upon enrollment.
   - The booklet was printed in both Cantonese and English, in 12-point font, making the terms reasonably accessible.

2. **Implied Terms:**
   - The booklet explicitly stated that the availability of any one instructor was not guaranteed, providing a defense against claims related to Vincent's unavailability.

3. **Reasonableness of Terms:**
   - X-Treme Learning can argue that the terms requiring both compulsory and optional homework were reasonable and necessary to ensure students' success.

**Conclusion:**
X-Treme Learning may face claims for misrepresentation and breach of contract. However, the defenses related to the disclosure of terms and the explicit statements in the welcome booklet provide a strong basis to counter these claims. The ambiguity in the terms and conditions may still pose a challenge, and X-Treme Learning should be prepared to address this issue in court.
