### Minor Premise:

1. CITY SUCCESS LTD v. H&M HENNES & MAURITZ LTD [2019] HKCFI 2444:
- Vincent gave notice involving the exercise of an option to renew the lease.
- The notice was construed objectively, taking into account the relevant objective contextual scene including the terms of the lease.
- The notice was posted but never reached the landlord, thus it did not comply with the agreed specification of "by notice in writing" as it was not received.

2. HCA004725/2001 & HCA4726/2001:
- The lease agreement did specify the procedure to be followed for the exercise of the option ("by notice in writing").
- The notice was not received by the landlord, so it did not unambiguously convey to the reasonable recipient the sender's decision to exercise the option.

3. Tai Hing Estates Limited v Lam Shu Yuk:
- The parties contracted to provide for a right of a renewed term at the option of the tenant.
- Vincent did not strictly observe the terms thereof as the notice was not received by the landlord.

Contract Law principles on misrepresentation and terms of contract

### Major Premise:

1. Contract Law principles on misrepresentation and terms of contract

   Conditions:
   - A contract is formed based on the terms and representations made by one party to another.
   - The terms and conditions of a promotion must be clear and unambiguous to the reasonable recipient.
   - Any ambiguity in the terms and conditions may lead to a claim of misrepresentation or breach of contract.

   Consequences:
   - The party making the representation or setting the terms may be liable for misrepresentation or breach of contract if the terms are ambiguous or misleading.

   Exceptions:
   - If the terms and conditions are clearly communicated and understood by the parties involved, there is no liability for misrepresentation or breach of contract.

### Minor Premise:

1. Contract Law principles on misrepresentation and terms of contract:
- The "5 Or Nothing" promotion was advertised with terms and conditions stated in small print without clear indication of where they could be found.
- The welcome booklet provided to students clarified the terms, but there was ambiguity regarding the completion of both compulsory and optional homework.
- Students believed only compulsory homework was required, leading to confusion and claims of misrepresentation.
- Vincent clarified that both kinds of homework had to be completed, which was not clearly communicated initially.

### Conclusion:

X-Treme Learning may be liable for misrepresentation or breach of contract due to the ambiguity in the terms and conditions of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion. The students have a potential legal claim based on the unclear communication of the promotion's requirements.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA004669/1999)
In the case of HCA004669/1999 (precedent p), the court ruled that the notices served by the plaintiffs were valid despite a clerical error in the date for completion. The court held that the effective date for completion was already fixed by the Deeds, and the plaintiffs had complied with all necessary conditions. The court applied the modern approach to the construction of contracts and contractual notices as expounded in Mannai Investment Co. Ltd. v. Eagle Star Life Assurance Co. Ltd., which allows for the correction of obvious clerical errors if the intention is clear.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA004669/1999 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Exercise of Option**: In both cases, there is an exercise of an option to renew or enforce a contractual right.
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA004669/1999, the plaintiffs exercised their option to require the defendant to purchase shares. In our current case, Vincent exercised the option to renew the lease.
- **Legal Concept 2: Clerical Error in Notice**: Both cases involve a clerical error in the notice given to the other party.
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA004669/1999, the completion date was incorrectly stated as 19th March instead of 20th March. In our current case, the letter exercising the option to renew the lease was posted but never reached the landlord.
- **Legal Concept 3: Intention to Comply with Contractual Terms**: The intention to comply with the contractual terms is clear in both cases.
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA004669/1999, the plaintiffs clearly intended to adhere to the Deeds despite the clerical error. In our current case, Vincent clearly intended to renew the lease as evidenced by the continued occupation and payment of rent.
- **Legal Concept 4: Modern Approach to Contractual Notices**: The modern approach to the construction of contractual notices, which allows for the correction of obvious errors, is applied in both cases.
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCA004669/1999, the court applied the Mannai principle to correct the clerical error. In our current case, the principle can be applied to argue that the non-receipt of the letter should not invalidate the exercise of the option.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA004669/1999)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern involving the exercise of an option with a clear intention to comply with contractual terms, and there is a clerical error or issue with the notice, the court should decide that the notice is valid if the intention is clear. This rule was justified in HCA004669/1999 because the positive effects of upholding the contractual intention and ensuring fairness in commercial dealings outweigh the negative effects of strict formalism. The court's decision promotes the underlying values of commercial certainty and fairness, ensuring that minor clerical errors do not frustrate the parties' clear intentions.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA004669/1999) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Exercise of Option**: In both cases, there is an exercise of an option to renew or enforce a contractual right.
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA004669/1999, the plaintiffs exercised their option to require the defendant to purchase shares. In our current case, Vincent exercised the option to renew the lease.

- **Legal Concept 2: Clerical Error in Notice**: Both cases involve a clerical error in the notice given to the other party.
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA004669/1999, the completion date was incorrectly stated as 19th March instead of 20th March. In our current case, the letter exercising the option to renew the lease was posted but never reached the landlord.

- **Legal Concept 3: Intention to Comply with Contractual Terms**: The intention to comply with the contractual terms is clear in both cases.
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA004669/1999, the plaintiffs clearly intended to adhere to the Deeds despite the clerical error. In our current case, Vincent clearly intended to renew the lease as evidenced by the continued occupation and payment of rent.

- **Legal Concept 4: Modern Approach to Contractual Notices**: The modern approach to the construction of contractual notices, which allows for the correction of obvious errors, is applied in both cases.
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCA004669/1999, the court applied the Mannai principle to correct the clerical error. In our current case, the principle can be applied to argue that the non-receipt of the letter should not invalidate the exercise of the option.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCA004669/1999. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA004669/1999, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Contractual Intention**: The court would be upholding the clear intention of Vincent to renew the lease, which is evidenced by his continued occupation of the premises and regular rental payments. This promotes commercial certainty and fairness.

2. **Avoiding Unjust Outcomes**: Strict formalism in requiring the actual receipt of the notice by the landlord, despite clear evidence of intention and compliance with other terms, would lead to an unjust outcome. The landlord was aware of Vincent's intention to renew and even offered a rent reduction, indicating that the landlord was not misled or prejudiced by the non-receipt of the letter.

3. **Promoting Commercial Sense**: The modern approach to contractual notices, as expounded in Mannai, favors a commercially sensible construction. This approach ensures that minor clerical errors or issues with notice do not frustrate the parties' clear intentions, thereby promoting business efficacy.

Therefore, applying the rule from HCA004669/1999 to the current case, the court should find that Vincent validly exercised the option to renew the lease despite the letter not reaching the landlord. This decision aligns with the principles of commercial certainty, fairness, and the modern approach to contractual notices.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the landlord's offer of a 30% rent reduction, that was not present in HCA004669/1999. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of exercising an option with a clerical error or issue with the notice. Because of the landlord's offer, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences than positive ones, unlike in HCA004669/1999.

In HCA004669/1999, the court's decision was based on the clear intention of the plaintiffs to comply with the Deeds and the minor clerical error in the completion date. The court applied the modern approach to contractual notices, allowing for the correction of obvious errors to uphold the parties' intentions.

However, in our current case, the landlord's offer of a 30% rent reduction introduces a new dynamic. This offer was contingent upon Vincent exercising the option to renew the lease. The landlord's offer indicates a willingness to negotiate and accommodate Vincent's business difficulties, which is a significant factor that was not present in HCA004669/1999. The landlord's subsequent letter in December 2021, notifying Vincent of the full rent due starting January 2022, further complicates the situation.

Due to the landlord's offer and the subsequent letter, applying the same outcome as in HCA004669/1999 would have more negative consequences, such as undermining the landlord's conditional offer and potentially leading to disputes over the agreed terms of the lease renewal. Unlike in HCA004669/1999, where the clerical error was minor and did not affect the parties' understanding of the contractual terms, the landlord's offer in our case introduces a conditional element that significantly impacts the lease renewal process.

Therefore, the presence of the landlord's offer in our current case conflicts with the shared fact pattern of a clerical error or issue with the notice and significantly alters the balance of positive and negative effects. This distinction suggests that the court should carefully consider the landlord's offer and the subsequent communications between the parties before determining the validity of the lease renewal.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA004669/1999 should be stated as: "When both the exercise of an option with a clear intention to comply with contractual terms and a clerical error or issue with the notice are present, and there is an additional conditional offer from the other party, the court should decide that the notice is valid if the intention is clear and the conditional offer is acknowledged." Omitting the conditional offer from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of undermining the conditional terms negotiated between the parties, which could result in unfairness and disputes over the agreed terms of the lease renewal. Indeed, the opinion in HCA004669/1999 explicitly states that the modern approach to contractual notices, which allows for the correction of obvious errors, is crucial to their decision. However, the presence of a conditional offer introduces a new dynamic that must be considered to ensure fairness and uphold the parties' intentions.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA004669/1999 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of minor clerical errors frustrating the parties' clear intentions and leading to unjust outcomes. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence occurring because the landlord's conditional offer introduces a new element that significantly impacts the lease renewal process. The landlord's offer of a 30% rent reduction was contingent upon Vincent exercising the option to renew the lease, and this conditional offer must be acknowledged to ensure fairness and uphold the parties' intentions. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule without considering the conditional offer would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The court should carefully consider the landlord's offer and the subsequent communications between the parties before determining the validity of the lease renewal.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the specific clerical error in the notice, which was present in the precedent case HCA004669/1999, requiring this factor for all similar cases of exercising an option with a clear intention to comply with contractual terms would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would mean that any minor issue with the notice, such as non-receipt due to postal issues, could invalidate the exercise of an option, even when the intention to comply is clear and evidenced by actions such as continued occupation and payment of rent. Conversely, not requiring the specific clerical error would allow for a more flexible and fair approach that upholds the parties' clear intentions and promotes commercial certainty. This better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, which favor a commercially sensible construction of contractual notices and the correction of obvious errors to prevent unjust outcomes.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the specific clerical error in the notice, which was present in HCA004669/1999, we have the additional factor of the landlord's conditional offer of a 30% rent reduction. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of exercising an option with a clear intention to comply with contractual terms, serves a similar function to the clerical error in the precedent case. The landlord's offer indicates an acknowledgment of Vincent's intention to renew the lease and a willingness to negotiate terms, which supports the argument that the non-receipt of the letter should not invalidate the exercise of the option. Given the presence of the landlord's conditional offer, we submit that the reasoning in HCA004669/1999 still applies, as the positive effects on commercial certainty, fairness, and the modern approach to contractual notices would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA004669/1999, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the exercise of an option with a clear intention to comply with contractual terms and an issue with the notice. However, it also differs in a significant way: the landlord's conditional offer of a 30% rent reduction, which was not present in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule of validating the notice if the intention is clear, even in the presence of a clerical error or issue with the notice, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the landlord's conditional offer in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the modern approach to contractual notices, as expounded in Mannai, favors a commercially sensible construction and the correction of obvious errors to uphold the parties' intentions. On the other hand, the landlord's conditional offer introduces a new dynamic that must be acknowledged to ensure fairness and uphold the negotiated terms.

Considering the underlying legal principles of commercial certainty, fairness, and the modern approach to contractual notices, we conclude that Vincent validly exercised the option to renew the lease despite the letter not reaching the landlord. This decision aligns with the principles of commercial certainty and fairness, as Vincent's continued occupation and regular rental payments clearly indicate his intention to renew the lease. The landlord's conditional offer and subsequent communications further support this conclusion, as they indicate an acknowledgment of Vincent's intention and a willingness to negotiate terms.

Therefore, the court should find that Vincent validly exercised the option to renew the lease, and the non-receipt of the letter should not invalidate this exercise. This decision promotes commercial sense and ensures that minor issues with notice do not frustrate the parties' clear intentions, thereby upholding the principles of fairness and legal consistency.

3. Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 7 Section 120AAZD Subsections 3, 4:
   - The landlord offered a 30% reduction in rent.
   - The landlord notified Vincent in writing before the reduction.
   - Therefore, this section applies.

### Conclusion:

Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 7 Section 120AAZD Subsections 3, 4 applies, and the landlord may reduce the amount of rent payable by X-Treme Learning for the remaining period of the term.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD)

In the case of SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD (precedent p), the tenant entered into a tenancy agreement during a period of social unrest, which later continued and was compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic. The tenant sought rent reduction and argued frustration of the lease due to these events. The court ruled that the tenant's evidence on pre-contractual negotiations was inadmissible and did not lead to a triable issue. The court also found that the tenant's acceptance of the landlord's offer for rent reduction was not valid as it did not comply with the stipulated conditions. Furthermore, the court held that the lease was not frustrated by the social unrest or the COVID-19 pandemic as the events did not significantly change the nature of the contractual obligations.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Pre-Contractual Negotiations and Entire Agreement Clause**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the tenants relied on pre-contractual negotiations to argue their position. In SUNBROAD, the tenant argued that the landlord was aware of their business reliance on tourists. In our current case, Vincent relied on the landlord's verbal offer of a 30% rent reduction.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Acceptance of Offer**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In SUNBROAD, the tenant's acceptance of the rent reduction offer was disputed due to non-compliance with stipulated conditions. In our current case, Vincent's acceptance of the landlord's offer was not formalized in writing as required by the lease agreement.

- **Legal Concept 3: Frustration of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In SUNBROAD, the tenant argued that the lease was frustrated due to social unrest and the COVID-19 pandemic. In our current case, Vincent's business was significantly impacted by the pandemic, leading to a request for rent reduction.

- **Legal Concept 4: Performance of Contractual Obligations**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In SUNBROAD, the tenant continued to operate and make rental payments despite the social unrest and pandemic. In our current case, X-Treme Learning continued to operate and make rental payments despite the decline in business.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of reliance on pre-contractual negotiations, disputed acceptance of an offer, claims of frustration due to external events, and continued performance of contractual obligations, the court should decide that the tenant's arguments for rent reduction and frustration are not valid. This rule was justified in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD because the positive effects (E+) of upholding the integrity of the contractual terms and ensuring that parties adhere to formal acceptance procedures outweigh the negative effects (E-) of the tenant's business difficulties. The court emphasized the importance of clear and formal acceptance of offers and the high threshold for proving frustration of a lease.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Pre-Contractual Negotiations and Entire Agreement Clause**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the tenants relied on pre-contractual negotiations to argue their position. In SUNBROAD, the tenant argued that the landlord was aware of their business reliance on tourists. In our current case, Vincent relied on the landlord's verbal offer of a 30% rent reduction.

- **Legal Concept 2: Acceptance of Offer**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In SUNBROAD, the tenant's acceptance of the rent reduction offer was disputed due to non-compliance with stipulated conditions. In our current case, Vincent's acceptance of the landlord's offer was not formalized in writing as required by the lease agreement.

- **Legal Concept 3: Frustration of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In SUNBROAD, the tenant argued that the lease was frustrated due to social unrest and the COVID-19 pandemic. In our current case, Vincent's business was significantly impacted by the pandemic, leading to a request for rent reduction.

- **Legal Concept 4: Performance of Contractual Obligations**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In SUNBROAD, the tenant continued to operate and make rental payments despite the social unrest and pandemic. In our current case, X-Treme Learning continued to operate and make rental payments despite the decline in business.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Contractual Integrity**: Enforcing the requirement for formal acceptance of offers ensures that parties adhere to the agreed terms and conditions, thereby maintaining the integrity of contractual agreements. This is crucial for predictability and stability in commercial transactions.

2. **High Threshold for Frustration**: The doctrine of frustration should only be applied in exceptional circumstances where the performance of the contract becomes fundamentally different from what was agreed upon. This prevents parties from easily escaping their contractual obligations due to unforeseen but manageable difficulties.

3. **Encouraging Proper Documentation**: By requiring formal acceptance of offers, the court promotes the importance of proper documentation in business dealings. This reduces the likelihood of disputes arising from misunderstandings or informal agreements.

4. **Balancing Commercial Risks**: The decision acknowledges that commercial enterprises must bear certain risks, including economic downturns and external disruptions. Allowing tenants to claim frustration or rent reduction too readily would unfairly shift these risks onto landlords.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD, it would uphold the principles of contractual integrity, ensure a high threshold for frustration, encourage proper documentation, and balance commercial risks appropriately.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of a formal written acceptance requirement for the rent reduction offer. This formal requirement was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as upholding contractual integrity and ensuring clear and documented agreements, outweighed any potential drawbacks, such as the tenant's business difficulties. The court emphasized the importance of adhering to formal acceptance procedures to avoid disputes and maintain predictability in commercial transactions. However, in our current case, this crucial formal written acceptance requirement is notably absent as Vincent's acceptance of the landlord's offer for a 30% rent reduction was not formalized in writing, and the letter he posted never reached the landlord. This absence of formal acceptance documentation weakens the argument for enforcing the rent reduction offer.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the landlord's verbal offer of a 30% rent reduction, that was not present in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of disputed acceptance of an offer. Because of the landlord's verbal offer, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as undermining the reliability of verbal agreements and creating uncertainty in commercial dealings, than positive ones. Unlike in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD, where the formal written acceptance was a clear and enforceable condition, the verbal offer in our case introduces ambiguity and potential for dispute, making it less justifiable to enforce the rent reduction without clear documentation.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD should be stated as "When both the shared fact pattern of reliance on pre-contractual negotiations, disputed acceptance of an offer, claims of frustration due to external events, and continued performance of contractual obligations, and the presence of a formal written acceptance requirement are present, the court should decide that the tenant's arguments for rent reduction and frustration are not valid." Omitting the formal written acceptance requirement from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of undermining the reliability of verbal agreements and creating uncertainty in commercial dealings. Indeed, the opinion in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD explicitly states that the formal written acceptance was crucial to their decision, as it emphasized the importance of clear and documented agreements to avoid disputes and maintain predictability in commercial transactions.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of parties relying on informal or verbal agreements, which could lead to disputes and uncertainty in commercial transactions. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence occurring because the landlord's verbal offer of a 30% rent reduction was clear and specific, and X-Treme Learning continued to make regular rental payments, indicating a mutual understanding and acceptance of the terms. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—to ensure formal acceptance and prevent reliance on informal agreements—is not relevant to our situation where the verbal agreement was clear and acted upon by both parties.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the formal written acceptance requirement, which was present in the precedent case SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD, requiring this factor for all similar cases of disputed acceptance of an offer would lead to the undesirable consequence of undermining the reliability of verbal agreements and creating uncertainty in commercial dealings. Conversely, not requiring the formal written acceptance would allow for the recognition of mutual understanding and acceptance of terms through conduct, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, such as the intention of the parties and the practical realities of business operations.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the formal written acceptance requirement, which was present in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD, we have the additional factor of the landlord's verbal offer of a 30% rent reduction and the continued operation and rental payments by X-Treme Learning. This verbal offer, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of reliance on pre-contractual negotiations, disputed acceptance of an offer, claims of frustration due to external events, and continued performance of contractual obligations, serves a similar function to the formal written acceptance in the precedent case. Given the presence of the landlord's verbal offer and the subsequent conduct of both parties, we submit that the reasoning in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD still applies, as the positive effects on legal values, such as upholding the intention of the parties and recognizing practical business realities, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as reliance on pre-contractual negotiations, disputed acceptance of an offer, claims of frustration due to external events, and continued performance of contractual obligations. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of a formal written acceptance requirement and the presence of a clear verbal offer from the landlord.

The proposed legal rule from SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD, which emphasizes the importance of formal acceptance and a high threshold for frustration, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the practical realities of business operations and the mutual understanding between the parties.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of upholding contractual integrity and formal acceptance procedures (as argued in the precedent) against the need to recognize mutual understanding and practical business realities (as argued in the current case). Considering the underlying legal principles of contract law, including the intention of the parties and the doctrine of frustration, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the landlord's verbal offer of a 30% rent reduction should be enforceable.

This decision is reached because the verbal offer, combined with the continued operation and rental payments by X-Treme Learning, indicates a mutual understanding and acceptance of the terms. Enforcing the verbal agreement aligns with the principles of upholding the intention of the parties and recognizing practical business realities, while also serving justice and legal consistency.

Therefore, X-Treme Learning has the legal right to claim the 30% rent reduction for one year as verbally offered by the landlord, despite the absence of formal written acceptance. This decision balances the need for clear and documented agreements with the practicalities of business operations and mutual understanding between parties.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA003273/2001)
In the case of HCA003273/2001 BETWEEN EVERCOT ENTERPRISE COMPANY LIMITED SHUNG KING DEVELOPMENT COMPANY LIMITED MILLAP LIMITED, EGERIA INVESTMENT LIMITED and JOIN FORTUNE DEVELOPMENT LIMITED Plaintiffs AND STEADFAST FASHION COMPANY LIMITED formerly known as BESS FASHION CREATION COMPANY LIMITED Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the acceptance of rent by the landlord, even if done "without prejudice," constituted a waiver of the right to forfeit the lease. The court emphasized that the effect of an act relied upon as a waiver of forfeiture must be considered objectively, without regard to the state of mind of the landlord or the tenant.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA003273/2001 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Waiver of Forfeiture**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA003273/2001, the landlord accepted rent payments after the right to forfeit had arisen, which was considered a waiver of the right to forfeit. In our current case, the landlord accepted regular rental payments from X-Treme Learning even after the lease renewal letter was not received.

- **Legal Concept 2: Objective Consideration of Acts**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA003273/2001, the court held that the acceptance of rent must be considered objectively, without regard to the landlord's or tenant's state of mind. Similarly, in our current case, the landlord's acceptance of rent payments should be considered objectively to determine if it constitutes acceptance of the lease renewal.

- **Legal Concept 3: Communication and Notice**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA003273/2001, there was a dispute about whether the landlord's letter demanding rent was sent before or after a meeting. In our current case, there is a dispute about whether the landlord received the lease renewal letter sent by Vincent.

- **Legal Concept 4: Equitable Considerations**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCA003273/2001, the court considered the equitable principle that the landlord's actions (accepting rent) could not be undone by claiming a lack of intention to waive forfeiture. In our current case, the landlord's acceptance of rent payments could be seen as an equitable acceptance of the lease renewal, despite the non-receipt of the formal renewal letter.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA003273/2001)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a landlord accepting rent payments after a lease renewal period has commenced, the court should decide that the landlord has waived any right to forfeit the lease or reject the renewal. This rule was justified in HCA003273/2001 because the positive effects of ensuring stability and predictability in landlord-tenant relationships, and upholding equitable principles, outweigh the negative effects of potentially allowing tenants to benefit from procedural oversights.

In summary, based on the precedent set in HCA003273/2001, X-Treme Learning has a reasonable argument that the landlord's acceptance of rent payments constitutes an acceptance of the lease renewal, despite the landlord not receiving the formal renewal letter. This is because the landlord's actions should be considered objectively, and the acceptance of rent payments can be seen as an unequivocal act of waiver of any right to reject the lease renewal.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA003273/2001) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Waiver of Forfeiture**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA003273/2001, the landlord accepted rent payments after the right to forfeit had arisen, which was considered a waiver of the right to forfeit. In our current case, the landlord accepted regular rental payments from X-Treme Learning even after the lease renewal letter was not received.

- **Legal Concept 2: Objective Consideration of Acts**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA003273/2001, the court held that the acceptance of rent must be considered objectively, without regard to the landlord's or tenant's state of mind. Similarly, in our current case, the landlord's acceptance of rent payments should be considered objectively to determine if it constitutes acceptance of the lease renewal.

- **Legal Concept 3: Communication and Notice**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA003273/2001, there was a dispute about whether the landlord's letter demanding rent was sent before or after a meeting. In our current case, there is a dispute about whether the landlord received the lease renewal letter sent by Vincent.

- **Legal Concept 4: Equitable Considerations**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCA003273/2001, the court considered the equitable principle that the landlord's actions (accepting rent) could not be undone by claiming a lack of intention to waive forfeiture. In our current case, the landlord's acceptance of rent payments could be seen as an equitable acceptance of the lease renewal, despite the non-receipt of the formal renewal letter.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCA003273/2001. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA003273/2001, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Stability and Predictability**: Upholding the principle that the acceptance of rent payments constitutes a waiver of the right to reject the lease renewal ensures stability and predictability in landlord-tenant relationships. Tenants can rely on the landlord's actions (acceptance of rent) as an indication of the continuation of the lease, which is crucial for business planning and operations.

2. **Equitable Treatment**: Considering the landlord's acceptance of rent payments as an objective act of waiver promotes equitable treatment. It prevents landlords from benefiting from procedural oversights or technicalities to the detriment of tenants who have acted in good faith.

3. **Encouragement of Good Faith Actions**: This outcome encourages both parties to act in good faith and communicate clearly. Tenants are encouraged to continue making rent payments, and landlords are encouraged to promptly address any issues related to lease renewals or terminations.

4. **Legal Consistency**: Applying the same rule ensures consistency in legal decisions, which is a fundamental principle of common law systems. It reinforces the precedent set in HCA003273/2001 and provides clear guidance for future cases involving similar fact patterns.

Therefore, based on the precedent set in HCA003273/2001 and the shared fact patterns, the court should find that the landlord's acceptance of rent payments constitutes an acceptance of the lease renewal, despite the non-receipt of the formal renewal letter. This decision would uphold the principles of stability, predictability, equitable treatment, and legal consistency.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA003273/2001, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the landlord had unequivocally accepted rent payments after the right to forfeit had arisen. This acceptance of rent was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—such as stability and predictability in landlord-tenant relationships and equitable treatment—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided clear evidence of the landlord's intention to continue the lease despite the procedural issues.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of unequivocal acceptance of rent is notably absent. While the landlord did accept rent payments from X-Treme Learning, there is no clear evidence that the landlord was aware of the lease renewal letter not being received. The landlord's acceptance of rent could be interpreted as a continuation of the existing lease terms rather than an acceptance of the renewal terms. This lack of unequivocal acceptance of the lease renewal terms by the landlord weakens the argument that the landlord has waived any right to reject the lease renewal.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in HCA003273/2001: the explicit offer by the landlord to reduce the rent by 30% if the lease renewal option was exercised. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces a conditional element to the lease renewal that was not present in the precedent case.

Due to this conditional offer, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as potential disputes over the interpretation of the lease renewal terms and the conditional rent reduction. Unlike in HCA003273/2001, where the acceptance of rent was a straightforward indication of waiver, the conditional offer in our case complicates the interpretation of the landlord's acceptance of rent payments. This could lead to increased uncertainty and potential litigation, which would undermine the stability and predictability in landlord-tenant relationships that the precedent case aimed to uphold.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from HCA003273/2001 should be stated as: "When both the landlord's acceptance of rent payments after the right to forfeit has arisen (i*) and the landlord's knowledge of the lease renewal terms (m) are present, the court should decide that the landlord has waived the right to reject the lease renewal (o)." Omitting the landlord's knowledge of the lease renewal terms (m) from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of landlords being unfairly bound to lease renewals without their explicit or implicit consent, merely based on the acceptance of rent payments. Indeed, the opinion in HCA003273/2001 explicitly states that the acceptance of rent with knowledge of the breach constitutes a waiver, highlighting the importance of the landlord's knowledge in their decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in HCA003273/2001 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of landlords being able to forfeit leases despite having accepted rent payments with full knowledge of the tenant's breach. This rule ensures that landlords cannot act in bad faith by accepting rent while simultaneously planning to forfeit the lease. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because the landlord did not have explicit knowledge of the lease renewal terms due to the non-receipt of the formal renewal letter. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—preventing bad faith forfeiture by landlords—is not relevant to our situation. The landlord's acceptance of rent payments in this case does not unequivocally indicate acceptance of the lease renewal terms, given the lack of knowledge about the renewal letter.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the landlord's explicit knowledge of the lease renewal terms (factor m), which was present in the precedent case HCA003273/2001, requiring this factor for all similar cases of the landlord accepting rent payments after the right to forfeit has arisen (fact pattern i*) would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would allow landlords to benefit from procedural oversights or technicalities, thereby undermining the stability and predictability in landlord-tenant relationships. Conversely, not requiring the landlord's explicit knowledge of the lease renewal terms would allow for a more equitable treatment of tenants who have acted in good faith by continuing to make rent payments. This better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, which aim to promote fairness and prevent bad faith actions by landlords.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the landlord's explicit knowledge of the lease renewal terms (factor m), which was present in HCA003273/2001, we have the additional factor of the landlord's conditional offer to reduce the rent by 30% if the lease renewal option was exercised (factor n). This factor n, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of the landlord accepting rent payments after the right to forfeit has arisen (fact pattern i*), serves a similar function to factor m in the precedent case. Given the presence of factor n, we submit that the reasoning in HCA003273/2001 still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as stability, predictability, and equitable treatment would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. The landlord's conditional offer indicates an intention to continue the lease under modified terms, which, combined with the acceptance of rent payments, should be considered an acceptance of the lease renewal.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA003273/2001, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the landlord's acceptance of rent payments after the right to forfeit has arisen and the need to consider the landlord's actions objectively. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of the landlord's explicit knowledge of the lease renewal terms and the presence of a conditional offer to reduce the rent if the lease renewal option was exercised.

The proposed legal rule that the landlord's acceptance of rent payments constitutes a waiver of the right to reject the lease renewal finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of stability and predictability in landlord-tenant relationships and the need for equitable treatment of tenants who act in good faith.

Considering the underlying legal principles of waiver, equitable treatment, and the objective consideration of actions, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the landlord's acceptance of rent payments in this case should be considered an acceptance of the lease renewal. This decision aligns with the precedent set in HCA003273/2001 and promotes fairness and stability in landlord-tenant relationships.

Key factors influencing this outcome include the landlord's conditional offer to reduce the rent, which indicates an intention to continue the lease under modified terms, and the objective consideration of the landlord's acceptance of rent payments. Therefore, X-Treme Learning has a reasonable argument that the landlord's actions constitute an acceptance of the lease renewal, despite the non-receipt of the formal renewal letter.

In summary, the landlord's acceptance of rent payments, combined with the conditional offer to reduce the rent, should be viewed as an unequivocal act of waiver of any right to reject the lease renewal. This decision upholds the principles of stability, predictability, and equitable treatment in landlord-tenant relationships.

Contract Law principles regarding misrepresentation and terms of contract

### Major Premise:

1. Contract Law principles regarding misrepresentation and terms of contract

   Conditions:
   - A contract contains terms and conditions that are communicated to the parties.
   - A party makes a representation that induces another party to enter into the contract.
   - The representation is clear and unambiguous.
   - The terms and conditions are reasonably accessible to the parties.

   Consequences:
   - The terms and conditions are binding on the parties.
   - Misrepresentation can lead to claims for breach of contract or misrepresentation.

   Exceptions:
   - The terms and conditions were not reasonably accessible or were ambiguous.

### Minor Premise:

1. Contract Law principles regarding misrepresentation and terms of contract:
   - X-Treme Learning's "5 Or Nothing" promotion was advertised with terms and conditions stated in small print, but it did not specify where these terms could be found.
   - Prospective students received a welcome booklet that contained the terms and conditions, which were printed in 12-point font and were reasonably accessible.
   - The booklet specified that students had to attend at least six uninterrupted months of lessons and complete all assigned homework, including both compulsory and optional homework, to qualify for the promotion.
   - Some students only completed the compulsory homework, believing it to be all that was required, and accused Vincent of breaking his earlier promises.

### Conclusion:

The terms and conditions of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion were reasonably accessible to the students, and the requirement to complete both compulsory and optional homework was clearly stated. Therefore, X-Treme Learning can defend against the students' claims by arguing that the terms and conditions were binding and that there was no misrepresentation.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA 1477/2013)
In the case of HCA 1477/2013 BETWEEN POLYKOTE COATINGS MANUFACTURING COMPANY LIMITED Plaintiff and GRACE REHABILITATION CENTRE LIMITED Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the option to renew a lease must be exercised within the currency of the original tenancy unless the tenancy agreement explicitly states otherwise. The court found that the defendant's attempt to exercise the option after the lease had expired was invalid, and thus, the defendant had no defence to the claim for vacant possession.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA 1477/2013 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Exercise of Option to Renew**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA 1477/2013, the defendant attempted to exercise the option to renew after the lease had expired.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 in Current Case**: Vincent attempted to exercise the option to renew the lease by sending a letter in April 2021, but the letter never reached the landlord, and the lease had already expired.
- **Legal Concept 2: Clear and Unambiguous Notice**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA 1477/2013, the court emphasized that the notice to exercise the option must be clear and unambiguous.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 in Current Case**: Vincent's letter, which never reached the landlord, did not provide clear and unambiguous notice of the exercise of the option.
- **Legal Concept 3: Presumed Intention of the Parties**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA 1477/2013, the court considered the presumed intention of the parties in the absence of explicit terms in the tenancy agreement.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 in Current Case**: The lease agreement in the current case does not specify the exact method or timing for exercising the option to renew, leading to questions about the presumed intention of the parties.
- **Legal Concept 4: Continuation of Tenancy**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCA 1477/2013, the court found that the continuation of the tenancy at will did not entitle the tenant to exercise the option to renew.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 in Current Case**: X-Treme Learning continued to occupy the premises and make rental payments, but this does not necessarily entitle them to exercise the option to renew.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA 1477/2013)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of an option to renew being exercised after the lease has expired and without clear and unambiguous notice, the court should decide that the option to renew is invalid. This rule was justified in HCA 1477/2013 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring clarity and certainty in lease agreements and respecting the presumed intention of the parties outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially harsh outcomes for tenants who fail to comply with the procedural requirements.

In summary, based on the precedent set in HCA 1477/2013, X-Treme Learning's attempt to exercise the option to renew the lease is likely invalid due to the lack of clear and unambiguous notice and the fact that the lease had already expired. Therefore, the landlord is within their rights to demand the full rent of $240,000 starting January 2022.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA 1477/2013) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Exercise of Option to Renew**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA 1477/2013, the defendant attempted to exercise the option to renew after the lease had expired.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 in Current Case**: Vincent attempted to exercise the option to renew the lease by sending a letter in April 2021, but the letter never reached the landlord, and the lease had already expired.

- **Legal Concept 2: Clear and Unambiguous Notice**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA 1477/2013, the court emphasized that the notice to exercise the option must be clear and unambiguous.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 in Current Case**: Vincent's letter, which never reached the landlord, did not provide clear and unambiguous notice of the exercise of the option.

- **Legal Concept 3: Presumed Intention of the Parties**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA 1477/2013, the court considered the presumed intention of the parties in the absence of explicit terms in the tenancy agreement.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 in Current Case**: The lease agreement in the current case does not specify the exact method or timing for exercising the option to renew, leading to questions about the presumed intention of the parties.

- **Legal Concept 4: Continuation of Tenancy**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCA 1477/2013, the court found that the continuation of the tenancy at will did not entitle the tenant to exercise the option to renew.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 in Current Case**: X-Treme Learning continued to occupy the premises and make rental payments, but this does not necessarily entitle them to exercise the option to renew.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCA 1477/2013. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA 1477/2013, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Clarity and Certainty in Lease Agreements**: By requiring that the option to renew be exercised within the currency of the original tenancy and through clear and unambiguous notice, the court would promote clarity and certainty in lease agreements. This helps both landlords and tenants understand their rights and obligations, reducing the potential for disputes.

2. **Respecting the Presumed Intention of the Parties**: The decision would respect the presumed intention of the parties, which is that the option to renew should be exercised within the original lease term unless explicitly stated otherwise. This aligns with the principles of contract interpretation and the reasonable expectations of the parties.

3. **Encouraging Proper Communication**: By upholding the requirement for clear and unambiguous notice, the court would encourage parties to communicate effectively and ensure that important notices are properly delivered and received. This reduces the risk of misunderstandings and disputes.

4. **Maintaining Legal Consistency**: Applying the same rule as in HCA 1477/2013 would maintain consistency in the legal treatment of similar cases, promoting fairness and predictability in the application of the law.

Therefore, based on the precedent set in HCA 1477/2013 and the shared fact patterns, the court should find that X-Treme Learning's attempt to exercise the option to renew the lease is invalid. Consequently, the landlord is within their rights to demand the full rent of $240,000 starting January 2022.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor: the landlord's verbal agreement to offer a 30% reduction on the rent for one year if Vincent exercised the option to renew the lease. This factor was not present in HCA 1477/2013. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces an element of negotiation and mutual understanding that was absent in the precedent case.

Due to this verbal agreement, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the principle of good faith negotiations and the reasonable expectations of the parties than positive ones, unlike in HCA 1477/2013. In our case, the landlord's verbal agreement to reduce the rent created a reasonable expectation for Vincent that the option to renew would be honored despite the letter not reaching the landlord. This mutual understanding and the subsequent actions taken by both parties (e.g., continued occupation and rental payments) suggest that the landlord had implicitly accepted the renewal, thereby altering the balance of positive and negative effects.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA 1477/2013 should be stated as 'When both [the option to renew being exercised after the lease has expired] and [a verbal agreement by the landlord to reduce the rent if the option is exercised] are present, the court should decide [that the option to renew is valid].' Omitting [the verbal agreement by the landlord to reduce the rent if the option is exercised] from this rule could lead to [undermining the principle of good faith negotiations and the reasonable expectations of the parties]. Indeed, the opinion in HCA 1477/2013 explicitly states that the presumed intention of the parties is crucial to their decision. In our current case, the landlord's verbal agreement to reduce the rent created a reasonable expectation for Vincent that the option to renew would be honored despite the letter not reaching the landlord. This mutual understanding and the subsequent actions taken by both parties (e.g., continued occupation and rental payments) suggest that the landlord had implicitly accepted the renewal, thereby altering the balance of positive and negative effects.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA 1477/2013 was clearly designed to prevent [tenants from unilaterally extending their tenancy without clear and unambiguous notice, thereby creating uncertainty and potential disputes]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [uncertainty and potential disputes] occurring because the landlord had verbally agreed to a rent reduction if the option to renew was exercised, and X-Treme Learning continued to make rental payments. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the explicit written notice that was present in the precedent case HCA 1477/2013, requiring this factor for all similar cases of exercising an option to renew would lead to undesirable consequences. Specifically, it would undermine the principle of good faith negotiations and the reasonable expectations of the parties. Conversely, not requiring explicit written notice in cases where there is a clear verbal agreement and subsequent actions that indicate mutual understanding would allow for a more equitable outcome. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which emphasize the importance of the parties' intentions and the context of their agreements.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the explicit written notice, which was present in HCA 1477/2013, we have the additional factor of a verbal agreement by the landlord to reduce the rent if the option is exercised. This verbal agreement, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of continued occupation and rental payments, serves a similar function to the explicit written notice in the precedent case. Given the presence of this verbal agreement, we submit that the reasoning in HCA 1477/2013 still applies, as the positive effects on ensuring clarity and respecting the presumed intention of the parties would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA 1477/2013, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the exercise of an option to renew after the lease had expired and the requirement for clear and unambiguous notice. However, it also differs significantly in that there was a verbal agreement by the landlord to reduce the rent if the option was exercised, which was not present in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule from HCA 1477/2013—that the option to renew must be exercised within the currency of the original tenancy and through clear and unambiguous notice—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the verbal agreement and subsequent actions taken by both parties in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of ensuring clarity and certainty in lease agreements (as emphasized in HCA 1477/2013) and the principle of good faith negotiations and the reasonable expectations of the parties (highlighted in the current case).

Considering the underlying legal principles of contract interpretation, the presumed intention of the parties, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the verbal agreement and the continued actions of both parties (i.e., X-Treme Learning's continued occupation and rental payments) create a reasonable expectation that the option to renew was implicitly accepted by the landlord. Therefore, the landlord's demand for the full rent of $240,000 starting January 2022 is not justified.

In summary, while the precedent set in HCA 1477/2013 provides a strong foundation for requiring clear and unambiguous notice within the currency of the original tenancy, the unique circumstances of the current case—specifically the verbal agreement and subsequent actions—warrant a departure from this strict rule to serve justice and uphold the principle of good faith negotiations. Accordingly, X-Treme Learning's attempt to exercise the option to renew the lease should be considered valid, and the landlord should honor the agreed-upon 30% rent reduction for one year.

   - The trader fails to offer those products for supply at that price for a period that is, and in quantities that are, reasonable, having regard to:
     * The nature of the market in which the trader carries on business.
     * The nature of the advertisement.

   Consequences:
   - The trader commits an offence.

   Exceptions:

   Exceptions:
   - None.

### Minor Premise:

1. Trade Descriptions Ordinance Cap. 362 Section 13G:
- X-Treme Learning engaged in a commercial practice that could constitute bait advertising by promoting the "5 Or Nothing" promotion.
- The promotion was advertised in newspapers and on social media, specifying that students who did not achieve a score of 5 would be entitled to a refund.
- There were no reasonable grounds for believing that X-Treme Learning could offer the refund as advertised, given the ambiguity in the terms and conditions.
- X-Treme Learning failed to offer the refund in a reasonable manner, as students were not clearly informed about the requirement to complete both compulsory and optional homework.
- The advertisement did not clearly state the period or quantities for which the promotion was offered.
- Therefore, X-Treme Learning may have committed an offence under this section.

2. Trade Descriptions Ordinance Cap. 362 Section 13H:
- X-Treme Learning engaged in a commercial practice that could constitute a bait and switch by promoting Vincent Wong as the instructor for the mathematics courses.
- The invitation to purchase the courses at a specified price was made through the "5 Or Nothing" promotion.
- After making the invitation, X-Treme Learning, with the intention of promoting the same courses but taught by a different instructor, failed to provide Vincent Wong as the instructor due to his illness.
- X-Treme Learning did not refuse to show or demonstrate the product, nor did it refuse to take orders or deliver within a reasonable time, but it did show a different "product" (a different instructor) than what was advertised.
- Therefore, X-Treme Learning may have committed an offence under this section.

### Conclusion:

Trade Descriptions Ordinance Cap. 362 Section 13G and 13H apply, and X-Treme Learning may have committed offences under both sections due to the misleading nature of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion and the failure to provide Vincent Wong as the instructor as advertised.

   - The conduct is equally consistent with an intention not to contract.
   - One party knows that the other party does not intend to contract on the terms alleged.

### Minor Premise:

#### (a) Lease Agreement:

1. The conduct of the parties is such that it would be reasonably understood by the other party as an offer to enter into a contract:
   - Vincent informed the landlord that X-Treme Learning would vacate unless the rent was reduced.
   - The landlord offered a 30% reduction on the rent for one year if Vincent exercised the option to renew the lease.

2. The conduct of the other party is such that it would be reasonably understood as an acceptance of that offer:
   - Vincent formally wrote to the landlord to extend the lease, although the letter never reached the landlord.
   - X-Treme Learning continued to operate out of its premises and made regular rental payments.

3. The conduct relied on is unequivocally referable to the contract sought to be inferred:
   - X-Treme Learning's continued occupation and regular rental payments indicate acceptance of the renewal terms.

4. Exceptions:
   - The conduct is not equally consistent with an intention not to contract.
   - There is no indication that one party knew the other did not intend to contract on the terms alleged.

### Conclusion:

A legally binding contract to renew the lease at the reduced rate for one year may be inferred from the conduct of the parties. However, the landlord's letter in December 2021 indicates that the full rent of $240,000 would be due starting January 2022, suggesting a potential dispute over the terms of the renewal.

#### (b) '5 Or Nothing' Promotion:

1. The conduct of the parties is such that it would be reasonably understood by the other party as an offer to enter into a contract:
   - Vincent launched a marketing campaign for the "5 Or Nothing" promotion, which was advertised widely.

2. The conduct of the other party is such that it would be reasonably understood as an acceptance of that offer:
   - Hundreds of new students enrolled in X-Treme Learning Centre under the promotion.

3. The conduct relied on is unequivocally referable to the contract sought to be inferred:
   - Students provided personal identification and paid a deposit of one month’s fees, indicating acceptance of the promotion terms.

4. Exceptions:
   - The conduct is not equally consistent with an intention not to contract.
   - There is no indication that one party knew the other did not intend to contract on the terms alleged.

### Conclusion:

A legally binding contract may be inferred from the conduct of the parties regarding the "5 Or Nothing" promotion. However, disputes may arise over the interpretation of the terms and conditions, particularly regarding the completion of both compulsory and optional homework and the availability of Vincent as the instructor.

### Summary:

(a) X-Treme Learning has a legally binding contract to renew the lease at the reduced rate for one year, but there may be a dispute over the terms starting January 2022.

(b) The "5 Or Nothing" promotion constitutes a binding contractual offer, and X-Treme Learning may face legal claims from students regarding the interpretation of the promotion's terms and conditions.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited)
In the case of HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited (precedent p), the court ruled that the offence in question was a strict liability offence, meaning that proof of mens rea (intention or knowledge of wrongdoing) was not necessary. The court emphasized that the legislative intent was to ensure compliance with the ordinance, which aimed at regulating the use of personal data for direct marketing. The court also noted that the statutory language and the nature of the offence indicated that it was a regulatory offence rather than a crime in the ordinary sense.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Strict Liability Offence**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited, the court determined that the offence was a strict liability offence, meaning that the prosecution did not need to prove mens rea.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 in Current Case**: The issue in the current case involves whether the '5 Or Nothing' promotion constitutes a binding contractual offer, which may also involve strict liability principles if the terms and conditions are not clearly communicated.

- **Legal Concept 2: Legislative Intent and Compliance**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited, the court focused on the legislative intent to ensure compliance with the ordinance regulating direct marketing.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 in Current Case**: The marketing campaign by X-Treme Learning must comply with consumer protection laws and ensure that the terms and conditions of the '5 Or Nothing' promotion are clear and not misleading.

- **Legal Concept 3: Interpretation of Statutory Language**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited, the court interpreted the statutory language to determine the nature of the offence and the necessity of proving mens rea.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 in Current Case**: The interpretation of the promotional terms and conditions in the '5 Or Nothing' campaign will be crucial in determining whether a binding contractual offer was made.

- **Legal Concept 4: Consumer Protection and Fair Trading**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited, the court considered the broader implications of consumer protection and fair trading in the context of direct marketing.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 in Current Case**: The students' claims against X-Treme Learning will likely involve principles of consumer protection and fair trading, particularly regarding the clarity and fairness of the promotional terms.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited)
This suggests a general rule that when we see fact pattern i* (i.e., the presence of strict liability principles, legislative intent to ensure compliance, interpretation of statutory language, and consumer protection concerns), the court should decide outcome o (i.e., that the promotional terms and conditions must be clear and not misleading, and that compliance with consumer protection laws is paramount).

This rule was justified in HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring compliance with the ordinance and protecting consumers from misleading practices outweighed the negative effects (E-) of not requiring proof of mens rea. The court's decision promoted the underlying values of consumer protection, fair trading, and regulatory compliance, which are also relevant in the current case involving X-Treme Learning's '5 Or Nothing' promotion.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Strict Liability Offence**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited, the court determined that the offence was a strict liability offence, meaning that the prosecution did not need to prove mens rea.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 in Current Case**: The issue in the current case involves whether the '5 Or Nothing' promotion constitutes a binding contractual offer, which may also involve strict liability principles if the terms and conditions are not clearly communicated.

- **Legal Concept 2: Legislative Intent and Compliance**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited, the court focused on the legislative intent to ensure compliance with the ordinance regulating direct marketing.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 in Current Case**: The marketing campaign by X-Treme Learning must comply with consumer protection laws and ensure that the terms and conditions of the '5 Or Nothing' promotion are clear and not misleading.

- **Legal Concept 3: Interpretation of Statutory Language**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited, the court interpreted the statutory language to determine the nature of the offence and the necessity of proving mens rea.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 in Current Case**: The interpretation of the promotional terms and conditions in the '5 Or Nothing' campaign will be crucial in determining whether a binding contractual offer was made.

- **Legal Concept 4: Consumer Protection and Fair Trading**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited, the court considered the broader implications of consumer protection and fair trading in the context of direct marketing.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 in Current Case**: The students' claims against X-Treme Learning will likely involve principles of consumer protection and fair trading, particularly regarding the clarity and fairness of the promotional terms.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Compliance with Consumer Protection Laws**: By requiring that the terms and conditions of the '5 Or Nothing' promotion be clear and not misleading, the court would ensure that X-Treme Learning complies with consumer protection laws. This would protect students from potentially deceptive marketing practices and uphold the integrity of promotional offers.

2. **Promoting Fair Trading Practices**: Clear and transparent terms and conditions would promote fair trading practices, ensuring that students are fully informed about the requirements and limitations of the promotion before they enroll. This would prevent misunderstandings and disputes, fostering trust between X-Treme Learning and its students.

3. **Encouraging Accountability**: Holding X-Treme Learning accountable for the clarity of its promotional terms would encourage the institution to adopt more responsible marketing practices. This would benefit not only the students but also the broader educational industry by setting a standard for ethical conduct.

4. **Balancing Business Interests and Consumer Rights**: While the marketing campaign aims to attract more students, it is essential to balance business interests with consumer rights. Ensuring that promotional terms are clear and fair would achieve this balance, allowing X-Treme Learning to conduct its business effectively while respecting the rights of its students.

In conclusion, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns as the precedent, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited, it would have the positive effects of ensuring compliance with consumer protection laws, promoting fair trading practices, encouraging accountability, and balancing business interests with consumer rights.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the **regulatory nature of the offence**. The court emphasized that the offence was a regulatory one, aimed at ensuring compliance with the ordinance regulating the use of personal data for direct marketing. This regulatory nature was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as protecting consumer privacy and ensuring compliance with the law, outweighed any potential drawbacks, such as the reversal of the burden of proof and the derogation from the presumption of innocence.

However, in our current case, this crucial **regulatory nature of the offence** is notably absent. The issue at hand involves a **contractual dispute** between X-Treme Learning and its students regarding the '5 Or Nothing' promotion. This is fundamentally different from a regulatory offence aimed at protecting public interest. The contractual nature of the dispute means that the principles of contract law, such as offer, acceptance, and the clarity of terms, are more relevant than the regulatory compliance considerations that were central in the precedent case.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor **(the contractual nature of the dispute)** that was not present in **HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern **(i*)** because the focus shifts from regulatory compliance to the principles of contract law and consumer protection in a commercial context. Due to the **contractual nature of the dispute**, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as undermining the principles of fair trading and consumer rights, than positive ones, unlike in **HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited**. The contractual context requires a different approach, focusing on the clarity and fairness of the promotional terms and conditions, rather than the strict liability principles applicable in regulatory offences.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from **HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited** should be stated as: "When both [i*] (the presence of strict liability principles, legislative intent to ensure compliance, interpretation of statutory language, and consumer protection concerns) and [m] (the regulatory nature of the offence) are present, the court should decide [o] (that the promotional terms and conditions must be clear and not misleading, and that compliance with consumer protection laws is paramount)." Omitting [m] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q], which is the undermining of the principles of fair trading and consumer rights in a commercial context. Indeed, the opinion in **HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited** explicitly states that the regulatory nature of the offence was crucial to their decision, as it emphasized the importance of ensuring compliance with the ordinance and protecting consumer privacy.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in **HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited** was clearly designed to prevent [undesirable consequence u], which is the failure to ensure compliance with regulatory standards aimed at protecting public interest, particularly in the context of direct marketing and consumer privacy. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [u] occurring because the issue at hand involves a contractual dispute rather than a regulatory offence. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—ensuring compliance with regulatory standards—is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the focus should be on the principles of contract law and consumer protection in a commercial context, ensuring that the promotional terms and conditions are clear and fair to the students.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the regulatory nature of the offence, which was present in the precedent case HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited, requiring this factor for all similar cases of strict liability principles, legislative intent to ensure compliance, interpretation of statutory language, and consumer protection concerns would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would limit the application of consumer protection principles to only regulatory contexts, thereby undermining the protection of consumers in commercial contexts where misleading promotional practices can also cause significant harm. Conversely, not requiring the regulatory nature of the offence would allow for a broader application of consumer protection principles, ensuring that businesses are held accountable for clear and fair promotional terms, which better aligns with the underlying principles of consumer protection and fair trading laws.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the regulatory nature of the offence, which was present in HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited, we have the additional factor of the contractual nature of the dispute. This contractual nature, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of strict liability principles, legislative intent to ensure compliance, interpretation of statutory language, and consumer protection concerns, serves a similar function to the regulatory nature in the precedent case. Given the presence of the contractual nature, we submit that the reasoning in HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited still applies, as the positive effects on consumer protection and fair trading would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. The contractual context emphasizes the need for clear and fair terms, ensuring that students are fully informed and protected from misleading promotional practices.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of strict liability principles, legislative intent to ensure compliance, interpretation of statutory language, and consumer protection concerns. However, it also differs significantly in that the precedent case involved a regulatory offence, whereas the current case involves a contractual dispute.

The proposed legal rule from **HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited**—that the promotional terms and conditions must be clear and not misleading, and that compliance with consumer protection laws is paramount—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, particularly in the context of a contractual dispute rather than a regulatory offence.

We've weighed arguments from both sides. A strong point from the initial analogy is that ensuring compliance with consumer protection laws and promoting fair trading practices are crucial, regardless of whether the context is regulatory or contractual. On the other hand, a strong point from the rebuttal is that the regulatory nature of the offence in the precedent case was a significant factor in the court's decision, and this factor is absent in the current case.

Considering the underlying legal principles of consumer protection, fair trading, and the need for clear and fair contractual terms, we conclude that the decision in **HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited** should not be directly applied to the current case without modification. The contractual nature of the dispute requires a focus on the principles of contract law, particularly the clarity and fairness of the promotional terms and conditions.

Therefore, we determine that:

1. **X-Treme Learning's Legal Rights and Obligations in Relation to the Lease**:
   - X-Treme Learning has a legal obligation to pay the increased rent of $240,000 per month starting January 2022, as the landlord's offer of a 30% reduction was conditional upon the exercise of the renewal option, which was not effectively communicated due to the lost letter. However, the continued operation and payment of rent may imply acceptance of the new terms, and X-Treme Learning should seek to negotiate with the landlord to clarify the terms and potentially resolve any misunderstandings.

2. **Legal Claims the Students May Have and the Defenses Available**:
   - The students may have legal claims based on the misleading nature of the '5 Or Nothing' promotion, particularly regarding the unclear terms and conditions about homework requirements and the availability of Vincent as the instructor. X-Treme Learning's defense may include the argument that the terms and conditions were provided in the welcome booklet, but the lack of clarity in the initial advertisements and the subsequent changes in teaching staff may weaken this defense.

In conclusion, while the principles of consumer protection and fair trading are paramount, the specific context of a contractual dispute requires a nuanced approach that ensures the promotional terms and conditions are clear and fair to the students. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency.


# Contract Law: Whether the terms and conditions of the '5 Or Nothing' promotion were adequately communicated to the students

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Trade Descriptions Ordinance Cap. 362 Sections 13E, 13G, and 5

### Major Premise:

1. Trade Descriptions Ordinance Cap. 362 Section 13E Subsection 4

   Conditions:
   - A commercial practice is an invitation to purchase
   - The following information is not already apparent from the context:
     - The main characteristics of the product
     - The identity of the trader and of any other trader on whose behalf the trader is acting
     - The address of the trader’s usual place of business and of any other trader on whose behalf the trader is acting
     - The price, including any taxes, or the manner in which the price is calculated if it cannot reasonably be calculated in advance
     - All additional freight, delivery or postal charges, or the fact that they may be payable if they cannot reasonably be calculated in advance
     - Arrangements for payment, delivery of goods, or supply of service if they depart from the requirements of professional diligence
     - The existence of a right of withdrawal or cancellation for products in relation to which there is such a right

   Consequences:
   - The information is considered material and must be disclosed

   Exceptions:
   - None

2. Trade Descriptions Ordinance Cap. 362 Section 13G Subsections 1-3

   Conditions:
   - A trader engages in a commercial practice that constitutes bait advertising
   - The trader advertises products for supply at a specified price without reasonable grounds for believing that the trader will be able to offer those products at that price, or fails to offer those products at that price for a reasonable period and in reasonable quantities

   Consequences:
   - The trader commits an offence

   Exceptions:
   - The advertisement clearly states the period for which, or the quantities in which, the products are offered for supply at that price
   - The trader offers those products for supply at that price for that period or in those quantities

3. Trade Descriptions Ordinance Cap. 362 Section 5 Subsection 3

   Conditions:
   - An advertisement of any goods to be supplied in the course of any trade or business, or of any services to be supplied by a trader to a consumer, fails to comply with any requirement imposed under this section

   Consequences:
   - Any person who publishes the advertisement commits an offence

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Trade Descriptions Ordinance Cap. 362 Section 13E Subsection 4:
   - The "5 Or Nothing" promotion is a commercial practice and an invitation to purchase.
   - The advertisements did not clearly disclose the main characteristics of the promotion, such as the requirement to attend six uninterrupted months of lessons and complete all assigned homework.
   - The identity of the trader (Vincent Wong and X-Treme Learning) was apparent from the context.
   - The address of X-Treme Learning was not disclosed in the advertisements.
   - The price and terms of the refund were not clearly disclosed.
   - Additional charges or specific arrangements for payment were not mentioned.
   - The existence of a right of withdrawal or cancellation was not disclosed.

   Therefore, the information is considered material and must be disclosed.

2. Trade Descriptions Ordinance Cap. 362 Section 13G Subsections 1-3:
   - The "5 Or Nothing" promotion could be considered bait advertising if it was not reasonably believed that the promotion could be fulfilled as advertised.
   - Vincent did not have reasonable grounds to believe that he could personally teach all the classes, especially given his sudden illness.
   - The advertisement did not clearly state the period for which the promotion was valid or the quantities in which the promotion was offered.

   Therefore, Vincent may have committed an offence unless the exceptions apply, which they do not in this case.

3. Trade Descriptions Ordinance Cap. 362 Section 5 Subsection 3:
   - The advertisement for the "5 Or Nothing" promotion failed to comply with the requirements of disclosing material information as per Section 13E.
   - Therefore, any person who published the advertisement commits an offence.

### Conclusion:

Trade Descriptions Ordinance Cap. 362 Sections 13E, 13G, and 5 apply. X-Treme Learning failed to adequately communicate the terms and conditions of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion, making the information material and required to be disclosed. Additionally, the promotion may constitute bait advertising, and the advertisements failed to comply with the necessary legal requirements, resulting in potential offences under the Ordinance.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCMP 2483/2011)
In the case of HCMP 2483/2011 between Lee Yuk Shing (Plaintiff) and Dianoor International Limited (In Liquidation) (Defendant) (precedent p), the court ruled that the exclusion clauses in the auctioneer's Conditions of Sale did not meet the reasonableness test and were therefore ineffective in excluding liability for misdescription as to the nature of the goods. The court found that the terms were not adequately communicated to the bidders, and the exclusion clauses were not sufficiently brought to their attention.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCMP 2483/2011 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Reasonableness of Exclusion Clauses**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In HCMP 2483/2011, the court examined whether the exclusion clauses met the reasonableness test under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance. The clauses were found to be unreasonable because they were not adequately communicated to the bidders.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 in Current Case:** The terms and conditions of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion were printed in small print in the advertisements and were not clearly communicated to the students. The students only received the detailed terms after contacting X-Treme Learning.

- **Legal Concept 2: Adequate Notice of Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** In HCMP 2483/2011, the court found that the exclusion clauses were not given adequate notice, as they were printed in very small font and not highlighted to the bidders.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 in Current Case:** The terms and conditions of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion were not prominently displayed in the advertisements. The small print at the bottom of the advertisements did not state where the terms and conditions could be found.

- **Legal Concept 3: Reliance on Representations**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In HCMP 2483/2011, the court considered whether the bidders relied on the representations made in the auction catalogue and advertisements.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 in Current Case:** Students relied on the representations made in the advertisements, which prominently featured Vincent Wong and promised a refund if they did not achieve a score of 5, without clearly stating the conditions for eligibility.

- **Legal Concept 4: Misrepresentation and Deceit**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** In HCMP 2483/2011, the court addressed the issue of misrepresentation and whether the auctioneer's statements constituted deceit.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 in Current Case:** Students may claim that the advertisements were misleading and that they were deceived into enrolling under the "5 Or Nothing" promotion without being fully informed of the conditions.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCMP 2483/2011)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of inadequate communication of terms and conditions (i*), the court should decide that the exclusion clauses or terms are ineffective and do not meet the reasonableness test (outcome o). This rule was justified in HCMP 2483/2011 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that consumers are adequately informed and protected from unfair terms outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially limiting the freedom of contract for businesses. 

In our current case, the terms and conditions of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion were not adequately communicated to the students, similar to how the exclusion clauses were not adequately communicated to the bidders in HCMP 2483/2011. Therefore, the court is likely to find that the terms and conditions of the promotion do not meet the reasonableness test and are ineffective in excluding liability for the promises made in the advertisements.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCMP 2483/2011) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Reasonableness of Exclusion Clauses**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In HCMP 2483/2011, the court examined whether the exclusion clauses met the reasonableness test under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance. The clauses were found to be unreasonable because they were not adequately communicated to the bidders.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 in Current Case:** The terms and conditions of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion were printed in small print in the advertisements and were not clearly communicated to the students. The students only received the detailed terms after contacting X-Treme Learning.

- **Legal Concept 2: Adequate Notice of Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** In HCMP 2483/2011, the court found that the exclusion clauses were not given adequate notice, as they were printed in very small font and not highlighted to the bidders.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 in Current Case:** The terms and conditions of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion were not prominently displayed in the advertisements. The small print at the bottom of the advertisements did not state where the terms and conditions could be found.

- **Legal Concept 3: Reliance on Representations**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In HCMP 2483/2011, the court considered whether the bidders relied on the representations made in the auction catalogue and advertisements.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 in Current Case:** Students relied on the representations made in the advertisements, which prominently featured Vincent Wong and promised a refund if they did not achieve a score of 5, without clearly stating the conditions for eligibility.

- **Legal Concept 4: Misrepresentation and Deceit**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** In HCMP 2483/2011, the court addressed the issue of misrepresentation and whether the auctioneer's statements constituted deceit.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 in Current Case:** Students may claim that the advertisements were misleading and that they were deceived into enrolling under the "5 Or Nothing" promotion without being fully informed of the conditions.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCMP 2483/2011, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Consumer Protection:** Ensuring that students are adequately informed about the terms and conditions of promotions protects them from unfair and misleading business practices. This aligns with the underlying values of consumer protection laws.

2. **Fairness in Contracting:** By requiring businesses to clearly communicate important terms, the court promotes fairness in contractual relationships. This ensures that all parties have a clear understanding of their rights and obligations.

3. **Encouraging Transparency:** Holding businesses accountable for adequately communicating terms and conditions encourages transparency in commercial transactions. This builds trust between businesses and consumers.

4. **Deterrence of Misleading Practices:** A ruling that the terms and conditions were not adequately communicated would deter businesses from using small print or obscure language to hide important terms, thereby promoting honest and straightforward advertising practices.

In conclusion, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCMP 2483/2011, it would have the positive effects of protecting consumers, promoting fairness and transparency, and deterring misleading business practices.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the pandemic's impact on business operations, that was not present in HCMP 2483/2011. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of inadequate communication of terms and conditions. Due to the pandemic, X-Treme Learning faced unprecedented challenges that affected its ability to operate normally and communicate effectively with students. Applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as penalizing a business struggling to adapt to extraordinary circumstances, than positive ones, unlike in HCMP 2483/2011. The pandemic's impact on business operations introduces a level of complexity and urgency that was not present in the precedent case, making it unreasonable to hold X-Treme Learning to the same standard of communication under these exceptional conditions.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCMP 2483/2011 should be stated as: "When both inadequate communication of terms and conditions (i*) and extraordinary circumstances such as a pandemic (m) are present, the court should decide that the exclusion clauses or terms are ineffective and do not meet the reasonableness test (outcome o)." Omitting the extraordinary circumstances (m) from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence (q) of penalizing businesses that are struggling to adapt to unprecedented challenges, thereby discouraging them from making reasonable efforts to continue operations under difficult conditions. Indeed, the opinion in HCMP 2483/2011 explicitly states that the reasonableness of exclusion clauses must be assessed in light of the surrounding circumstances, which would include extraordinary events like a pandemic.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCMP 2483/2011 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence (u) of businesses unfairly hiding important terms and conditions from consumers, thereby misleading them. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence (u) occurring to the same extent because the pandemic created extraordinary circumstances that affected X-Treme Learning's ability to communicate effectively. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The pandemic's impact introduces a level of complexity and urgency that necessitates a more nuanced approach to assessing the reasonableness of the communication of terms and conditions.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the extraordinary circumstances of a pandemic (factor m), which was present in the precedent case HCMP 2483/2011, requiring this factor for all similar cases of inadequate communication of terms and conditions (fact pattern i*) would lead to the undesirable consequence of allowing businesses to escape liability for misleading advertisements simply because they are not facing extraordinary circumstances. Conversely, not requiring the presence of a pandemic would allow for the desirable outcome of ensuring that businesses are held accountable for clearly communicating important terms and conditions to consumers, which better aligns with the underlying principles of consumer protection and fairness in contract law. This approach ensures that consumers are not misled and that businesses maintain transparency in their dealings, regardless of external circumstances.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the extraordinary circumstances of a pandemic (factor m), which was present in HCMP 2483/2011, we have the additional factor of the marketing campaign's success and the subsequent issues arising from Vincent Wong's illness (factor n). This factor n, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of inadequate communication of terms and conditions (i*), serves a similar function to factor m in the precedent case. Given the presence of factor n, we submit that the reasoning in HCMP 2483/2011 still applies, as the positive effects on consumer protection and fairness in contract law would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. The marketing campaign's success and the issues arising from Vincent Wong's illness highlight the importance of clear communication of terms and conditions to avoid consumer dissatisfaction and potential legal disputes.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCMP 2483/2011, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in the inadequate communication of terms and conditions and the reliance on representations made in advertisements. However, it also differs in significant ways, notably the impact of the pandemic on X-Treme Learning's business operations and the subsequent issues arising from Vincent Wong's illness.

The proposed legal rule that exclusion clauses or terms are ineffective and do not meet the reasonableness test when inadequately communicated finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the extraordinary circumstances faced by X-Treme Learning.

**Merits of the Arguments:**
1. **Initial Analogy (Steps 1-4):** The initial analogy correctly identifies the shared legal concepts and fact patterns between the precedent and the current case. It highlights the importance of adequate communication of terms and conditions and the reliance on representations made in advertisements.
2. **Rebuttal Arguments (Steps 5-8):** The rebuttal arguments effectively introduce the impact of the pandemic as an extraordinary circumstance that significantly alters the situation. This factor is crucial in assessing the reasonableness of the communication of terms and conditions.
3. **Surrebuttal Arguments (Steps 9-10):** The surrebuttal arguments emphasize the importance of holding businesses accountable for clear communication, regardless of external circumstances. They also introduce the marketing campaign's success and Vincent Wong's illness as additional factors that highlight the need for clear communication to avoid consumer dissatisfaction and potential legal disputes.

**Flaws of the Arguments:**
1. **Initial Analogy (Steps 1-4):** The initial analogy does not fully account for the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic, which significantly impacted X-Treme Learning's ability to operate and communicate effectively.
2. **Rebuttal Arguments (Steps 5-8):** While the rebuttal arguments correctly identify the impact of the pandemic, they may overemphasize this factor to the detriment of consumer protection and fairness in contract law.
3. **Surrebuttal Arguments (Steps 9-10):** The surrebuttal arguments may downplay the significance of the pandemic's impact, which is a crucial factor in assessing the reasonableness of the communication of terms and conditions.

**Final Decision:**
Considering the underlying legal principles of consumer protection, fairness in contract law, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the terms and conditions of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion were not adequately communicated to the students. Therefore, the court should find that these terms and conditions do not meet the reasonableness test and are ineffective in excluding liability for the promises made in the advertisements.

**Key Factors Influencing the Outcome:**
1. **Consumer Protection:** Ensuring that students are adequately informed about the terms and conditions of promotions protects them from unfair and misleading business practices.
2. **Fairness in Contracting:** By requiring businesses to clearly communicate important terms, the court promotes fairness in contractual relationships.
3. **Extraordinary Circumstances:** While the pandemic's impact on X-Treme Learning's operations is a significant factor, it does not absolve the business from the responsibility of clear communication, especially when consumer expectations are shaped by prominent advertisements.

In conclusion, the decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by balancing the need for consumer protection with the recognition of extraordinary circumstances.

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Trade Descriptions Ordinance Cap. 362 Section 13E Subsection 4 and 5, Section 13G Subsections 1-3, and Section 5 Subsection 3

### Major Premise:

1. Trade Descriptions Ordinance Cap. 362 Section 13E Subsection 4 and 5

   Conditions:
   - A commercial practice is an invitation to purchase
   - The following information is not already apparent from the context:
     - The main characteristics of the product, to the extent appropriate to the product and to the medium by which the invitation to purchase is communicated
     - The identity (such as trading name) of the trader and of any other trader on whose behalf the trader is acting
     - The address (not including a postal box address) of the trader’s usual place of business and of any other trader on whose behalf the trader is acting
     - Either the price, including any taxes, or if the nature of the product is such that the price cannot reasonably be calculated in advance, the manner in which the price is calculated
     - Where appropriate, either all additional freight, delivery or postal charges, or if those charges cannot reasonably be calculated in advance, the fact that they may be payable
     - The following matters if they depart from the requirements of professional diligence: arrangements for payment, arrangements for delivery of goods, arrangements for supply of service
     - For products in relation to which there is a right of withdrawal or cancellation, the existence of that right

   Consequences:
   - The information is material

   Exceptions:
   - None

2. Trade Descriptions Ordinance Cap. 362 Section 13G Subsections 1-3

   Conditions:
   - A trader engages in a commercial practice that constitutes bait advertising
   - There are no reasonable grounds for believing that the trader will be able to offer for supply those products at that price, or the trader fails to offer those products for supply at that price, for a period that is, and in quantities that are, reasonable, having regard to the nature of the market in which the trader carries on business and the nature of the advertisement

   Consequences:
   - The trader commits an offence

   Exceptions:
   - The advertisement states clearly the period for which, or the quantities in which, the products are offered for supply at that price
   - The trader offers those products for supply at that price for that period or in those quantities

3. Trade Descriptions Ordinance Cap. 362 Section 5 Subsection 3

   Conditions:
   - An advertisement of any goods to be supplied in the course of any trade or business, or of any services to be supplied by a trader to a consumer, fails to comply with any requirement imposed under this section

   Consequences:
   - Any person who publishes the advertisement commits an offence

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Trade Descriptions Ordinance Cap. 362 Section 13E Subsection 4 and 5:
   - X-Treme Learning's "5 Or Nothing" promotion is a commercial practice that constitutes an invitation to purchase.
   - The advertisements did not clearly state the terms and conditions of the promotion, nor where they could be found.
   - The main characteristics of the product (the tutoring service and the conditions for the refund) were not apparent from the context of the advertisement.
   - The identity of the trader (Vincent Wong and X-Treme Learning) was apparent.
   - The address of X-Treme Learning was not included in the advertisement.
   - The price of the service was not included in the advertisement.
   - Additional charges, if any, were not mentioned.
   - The arrangements for payment, delivery of goods, or supply of service were not mentioned.
   - The right of withdrawal or cancellation was not mentioned.

   Therefore, the information is material and should have been included in the advertisement.

2. Trade Descriptions Ordinance Cap. 362 Section 13G Subsections 1-3:
   - X-Treme Learning engaged in a commercial practice that could be considered bait advertising by promoting the "5 Or Nothing" refund without clearly stating the terms and conditions.
   - There were no reasonable grounds for believing that X-Treme Learning would be able to offer the refund under the advertised conditions, as the terms were not clearly communicated.

   Therefore, X-Treme Learning may have committed an offence unless the advertisement clearly stated the period for which, or the quantities in which, the products were offered for supply at that price, and X-Treme Learning offered those products for supply at that price for that period or in those quantities.

3. Trade Descriptions Ordinance Cap. 362 Section 5 Subsection 3:
   - The advertisement for the "5 Or Nothing" promotion failed to comply with the requirements of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance.

   Therefore, any person who published the advertisement (including Vincent Wong and X-Treme Learning) may have committed an offence.

### Conclusion:

Trade Descriptions Ordinance Cap. 362 Section 13E Subsection 4 and 5, Section 13G Subsections 1-3, and Section 5 Subsection 3 apply. X-Treme Learning's advertisement for the "5 Or Nothing" promotion failed to include material information and may constitute bait advertising. As a result, X-Treme Learning and Vincent Wong may have committed offences under the Trade Descriptions Ordinance. The requirement to complete both compulsory and optional homework was not clearly communicated in the advertisement, and therefore, it may not be considered part of the contract with the students.

## Deductive Reasoning: cfa

### Relevant law:

Marble Holding Limited v Yatin Development Limited

### Major Premise:

1. Marble Holding Limited v Yatin Development Limited

   Conditions:
   - The court reads the terms of the contract as a whole, giving the words used their natural and ordinary meaning in the context of the agreement, the parties’ relationship and all the relevant facts surrounding the transaction so far as known to the parties.
   - The words used are free of ambiguity and devoid of commercial absurdity.

   Consequences:
   - Their natural and ordinary meaning will apply.

   Exceptions:
   - The relevant surrounding circumstances demonstrate otherwise.

### Minor Premise:

1. Lease Agreement:
   - The lease agreement provided for a monthly rental of $200,000 for the first two years.
   - The agreement gave X-Treme Learning the option to renew the lease for an additional two years at an increased rate of $240,000 per month, the option to be exercised “by notice in writing”.
   - Vincent informed the landlord in March 2021 that X-Treme Learning would vacate unless the rent was reduced.
   - The landlord offered a 30% reduction on the rent for one year if the option to renew was exercised.
   - Vincent posted a letter in April 2021 to extend the lease, but the letter never reached the landlord.
   - X-Treme Learning continued to operate and made regular rental payments.

   - The court will read the terms of the lease agreement as a whole, giving the words their natural and ordinary meaning.
   - The requirement to exercise the option “by notice in writing” is clear and unambiguous.
   - The fact that the letter never reached the landlord means the option was not formally exercised as per the lease terms.
   - However, the continued operation and regular rental payments may demonstrate an implied acceptance of the renewal terms.

   - The relevant surrounding circumstances (pandemic, landlord's offer, continued operation) may demonstrate that the landlord accepted the renewal despite the lack of formal notice.

2. "5 Or Nothing" Promotion:
   - The promotion was advertised with terms and conditions applying, but the location of these terms was not specified.
   - The welcome booklet provided to students stated that both compulsory and optional homework had to be completed to qualify for the promotion.
   - The booklet also stated that the availability of any one instructor was not guaranteed and that X-Treme Learning could assign any member of the teaching staff to conduct any class.

   - The court will read the terms of the promotion as a whole, giving the words their natural and ordinary meaning.
   - The requirement to complete both compulsory and optional homework is clear and unambiguous in the booklet.
   - The terms regarding the availability of instructors are also clear and unambiguous.
   - The students' belief that only compulsory homework was required does not align with the clear terms in the booklet.

   - The relevant surrounding circumstances (advertisements, welcome booklet) do not demonstrate otherwise.

### Conclusion:

1. Lease Agreement:
   - The natural and ordinary meaning of the lease terms requires formal notice in writing to exercise the renewal option.
   - However, the relevant surrounding circumstances (landlord's offer, continued operation, and rental payments) may demonstrate an implied acceptance of the renewal.
   - Therefore, X-Treme Learning may argue that the lease has been renewed based on the landlord's conduct and the surrounding circumstances.

2. "5 Or Nothing" Promotion:
   - The requirement to complete both compulsory and optional homework is part of the contract, as it is clearly stated in the welcome booklet.
   - The students' claims that only compulsory homework was required are not supported by the clear terms of the contract.
   - Therefore, X-Treme Learning can defend against the students' claims by relying on the clear and unambiguous terms in the welcome booklet.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (PROFIT CASTLE HOLDINGS LTD AND ANOTHER v. OASIS BEAUTY LTD)

In the case of PROFIT CASTLE HOLDINGS LTD AND ANOTHER v. OASIS BEAUTY LTD [2022] HKCFI 2201; HCA 785/2021 (precedent p), the court ruled that the representations made by Dr Cho were not binding on Oasis Beauty due to the presence of entire agreement clauses and "no variation except in writing" clauses in the SP Agreement, Promissory Note, and Guarantee. The court found that the alleged oral representations were inconsistent with the written agreements and the contemporaneous evidence, and thus, the summary judgment was granted in favor of Oasis Beauty.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in PROFIT CASTLE HOLDINGS LTD AND ANOTHER v. OASIS BEAUTY LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Entire Agreement Clauses**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In the precedent case, the SP Agreement contained an entire agreement clause stating that it superseded all previous agreements and that any variation must be in writing. Similarly, in our current case, the lease agreement likely contains similar clauses that would require any variation to be in writing.

- **Legal Concept 2: No Variation Except in Writing Clauses**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: The precedent case involved clauses in the Promissory Note and Guarantee that stated no variation would be valid unless in writing. In our current case, the landlord's offer to reduce rent was not formalized in writing, which is crucial given the lease agreement's requirement for written notice to exercise the renewal option.

- **Legal Concept 3: Reliance on Oral Representations**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In the precedent case, the plaintiffs relied on alleged oral representations that were not documented in the written agreements. Similarly, Vincent relied on the landlord's oral promise of a rent reduction, which was not documented in writing.

- **Legal Concept 4: Conduct and Payment as Evidence of Agreement**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In the precedent case, the court considered the conduct of the parties and the payment of interest as evidence of the agreement's terms. In our current case, X-Treme Learning's continued operation and regular rental payments may be considered as evidence of the lease's renewal under the original terms.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (PROFIT CASTLE HOLDINGS LTD AND ANOTHER v. OASIS BEAUTY LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see fact pattern i* (i.e., the presence of entire agreement clauses, no variation except in writing clauses, reliance on oral representations, and conduct and payment as evidence of agreement), the court should decide outcome o (i.e., that the written terms of the agreement prevail and any oral variations are not binding unless documented in writing). This rule was justified in PROFIT CASTLE HOLDINGS LTD AND ANOTHER v. OASIS BEAUTY LTD because the positive effects (E+) of upholding the integrity and certainty of written agreements outweigh the negative effects (E-) of allowing parties to rely on potentially unreliable oral representations. This promotes legal certainty and reduces the risk of disputes arising from informal and undocumented agreements.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (PROFIT CASTLE HOLDINGS LTD AND ANOTHER v. OASIS BEAUTY LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Entire Agreement Clauses**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: The lease agreement likely contains an entire agreement clause that would require any variation to be in writing. This is similar to the SP Agreement in the precedent case, which contained an entire agreement clause stating that it superseded all previous agreements and that any variation must be in writing.

- **Legal Concept 2: No Variation Except in Writing Clauses**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: The landlord's offer to reduce rent was not formalized in writing, which is crucial given the lease agreement's requirement for written notice to exercise the renewal option. This mirrors the precedent case where the Promissory Note and Guarantee contained clauses stating no variation would be valid unless in writing.

- **Legal Concept 3: Reliance on Oral Representations**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: Vincent relied on the landlord's oral promise of a rent reduction, which was not documented in writing. Similarly, in the precedent case, the plaintiffs relied on alleged oral representations that were not documented in the written agreements.

- **Legal Concept 4: Conduct and Payment as Evidence of Agreement**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: X-Treme Learning's continued operation and regular rental payments may be considered as evidence of the lease's renewal under the original terms. In the precedent case, the court considered the conduct of the parties and the payment of interest as evidence of the agreement's terms.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in the precedent case. This decision would be justified because, as in PROFIT CASTLE HOLDINGS LTD AND ANOTHER v. OASIS BEAUTY LTD, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding the Integrity and Certainty of Written Agreements**: Enforcing the written terms of the lease agreement and requiring any variations to be documented in writing promotes legal certainty and reduces the risk of disputes arising from informal and undocumented agreements.

2. **Preventing Unreliable Oral Representations**: By not allowing oral representations to override written agreements, the court ensures that parties cannot easily claim variations based on potentially unreliable oral statements, thereby protecting the integrity of contractual relationships.

3. **Encouraging Proper Documentation**: This approach encourages parties to properly document any variations to agreements, ensuring that all parties are clear on their rights and obligations, which is particularly important in commercial transactions.

4. **Consistency in Legal Precedent**: Applying the same rule as in the precedent case ensures consistency in the application of the law, which is a fundamental principle of the common law system.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in PROFIT CASTLE HOLDINGS LTD AND ANOTHER v. OASIS BEAUTY LTD, it would uphold the integrity and certainty of written agreements, prevent reliance on unreliable oral representations, encourage proper documentation, and ensure consistency in legal precedent.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **PROFIT CASTLE HOLDINGS LTD AND ANOTHER v. OASIS BEAUTY LTD**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of **entire agreement clauses and "no variation except in writing" clauses** in the SP Agreement, Promissory Note, and Guarantee. These clauses were key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—upholding the integrity and certainty of written agreements—outweighed any potential drawbacks because they provided clear, documented terms that both parties had agreed upon, reducing the risk of disputes arising from informal and undocumented agreements. However, in our current case, this crucial **entire agreement clause** is notably absent as there is no explicit mention of such a clause in the lease agreement provided in the scenario. This absence means that the landlord's oral promise of a rent reduction could potentially be considered, unlike in the precedent case where the entire agreement clause precluded such oral variations.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor **(the landlord's oral promise of a rent reduction)** that was not present in **PROFIT CASTLE HOLDINGS LTD AND ANOTHER v. OASIS BEAUTY LTD**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces an element of reliance on an oral representation that was not documented in writing. Due to this oral promise, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the tenant's reliance on the landlord's assurances and potentially leading to unfair financial burdens on the tenant, unlike in **PROFIT CASTLE HOLDINGS LTD AND ANOTHER v. OASIS BEAUTY LTD** where the written agreements clearly outlined the terms and precluded reliance on oral representations. This distinction suggests that the court may need to consider the fairness and reasonableness of enforcing the original lease terms without acknowledging the landlord's oral promise.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **PROFIT CASTLE HOLDINGS LTD AND ANOTHER v. OASIS BEAUTY LTD** should be stated as 'When both [i*] (i.e., the presence of entire agreement clauses, no variation except in writing clauses, reliance on oral representations, and conduct and payment as evidence of agreement) and [m] (i.e., the absence of an entire agreement clause in the lease agreement) are present, the court should decide [o] (i.e., that the written terms of the agreement prevail and any oral variations are not binding unless documented in writing).' Omitting [m] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q] (i.e., undermining the tenant's reliance on the landlord's assurances and potentially leading to unfair financial burdens on the tenant). Indeed, the opinion in **PROFIT CASTLE HOLDINGS LTD AND ANOTHER v. OASIS BEAUTY LTD** explicitly states that the presence of entire agreement clauses and "no variation except in writing" clauses was crucial to their decision, as it provided clear, documented terms that both parties had agreed upon, reducing the risk of disputes arising from informal and undocumented agreements.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **PROFIT CASTLE HOLDINGS LTD AND ANOTHER v. OASIS BEAUTY LTD** was clearly designed to prevent [undesirable consequence u] (i.e., the risk of disputes arising from informal and undocumented agreements and ensuring the integrity and certainty of written agreements). However, in our current case, there's no risk of [u] occurring because the absence of an entire agreement clause in the lease agreement means that the landlord's oral promise of a rent reduction could potentially be considered. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The court should consider the fairness and reasonableness of enforcing the original lease terms without acknowledging the landlord's oral promise, given the absence of an entire agreement clause.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the explicit presence of an entire agreement clause, which was present in the precedent case **PROFIT CASTLE HOLDINGS LTD AND ANOTHER v. OASIS BEAUTY LTD**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of reliance on oral representations and conduct and payment as evidence of agreement would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would undermine the fairness and reasonableness of enforcing the original lease terms without acknowledging the landlord's oral promise, potentially leading to unfair financial burdens on the tenant. Conversely, not requiring the explicit presence of an entire agreement clause would allow for a more equitable consideration of the landlord's oral promise, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and reasonableness in contract law. This approach ensures that parties cannot easily disregard oral assurances that have been relied upon, thereby promoting trust and good faith in commercial relationships.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the explicit presence of an entire agreement clause, which was present in **PROFIT CASTLE HOLDINGS LTD AND ANOTHER v. OASIS BEAUTY LTD**, we have the additional factor of the landlord's oral promise of a rent reduction. This oral promise, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of reliance on oral representations and conduct and payment as evidence of agreement, serves a similar function to the entire agreement clause in the precedent case. Given the presence of the landlord's oral promise, we submit that the reasoning in **PROFIT CASTLE HOLDINGS LTD AND ANOTHER v. OASIS BEAUTY LTD** still applies, as the positive effects on fairness and reasonableness in contractual relationships would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. This ensures that the tenant's reliance on the landlord's assurances is acknowledged and that the contractual relationship remains equitable and just.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **PROFIT CASTLE HOLDINGS LTD AND ANOTHER v. OASIS BEAUTY LTD**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the reliance on oral representations and the presence of conduct and payment as evidence of agreement. However, it also differs significantly in the absence of an explicit entire agreement clause in the lease agreement and the presence of the landlord's oral promise of a rent reduction.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case—that the written terms of the agreement prevail and any oral variations are not binding unless documented in writing—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the absence of an entire agreement clause in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point from the initial analogy that upholding the integrity and certainty of written agreements promotes legal certainty and reduces disputes. On the other hand, the rebuttal argument highlights the fairness and reasonableness of considering the landlord's oral promise, given the absence of an entire agreement clause, which could lead to unfair financial burdens on the tenant if ignored.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, reasonableness, and the integrity of contractual relationships, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the court should acknowledge the landlord's oral promise of a rent reduction. This decision aligns with the principles of fairness and reasonableness in contract law, ensuring that parties cannot easily disregard oral assurances that have been relied upon, thereby promoting trust and good faith in commercial relationships.

Therefore, X-Treme Learning should be advised that while the written terms of the lease agreement are generally binding, the landlord's oral promise of a rent reduction should be considered, given the absence of an entire agreement clause and the reliance placed on that promise.

Regarding the students' claims, the "5 Or Nothing" promotion's terms and conditions, as outlined in the welcome booklet, are likely to be binding. However, the ambiguity regarding the completion of both compulsory and optional homework could be a point of contention. X-Treme Learning should clarify this requirement to avoid potential disputes and ensure that all promotional terms are clearly communicated to students.

In conclusion, the decision to acknowledge the landlord's oral promise and the need for clear communication of promotional terms serves justice and legal consistency, balancing the interests of all parties involved.

Both in THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF SHUN CHI COURT v. CITI-PRO PROPERTY SERVICES CO LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Contractual Obligations and Pleading Requirements**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In the precedent case, Citi-Pro failed to properly plead and provide evidence to support its claims against the IO's computation. Similarly, in our current case, the landlord may argue that Vincent did not properly exercise the option to renew the lease due to the letter not reaching the landlord.

- **Legal Concept 2: Balance of Probabilities**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: The court in the precedent case accepted the IO's claim on the balance of probabilities due to the lack of contrary evidence from Citi-Pro. In our current case, the students may argue that X-Treme Learning breached the contract by not having Vincent teach the mathematics classes as advertised, and the court will need to determine this on the balance of probabilities.

- **Legal Concept 3: Interpretation of Contractual Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: The court in the precedent case interpreted the terms of the contract to determine whether the adjustments proposed by Citi-Pro were valid. In our current case, the court will need to interpret the terms and conditions of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion to determine if X-Treme Learning breached the contract.

- **Legal Concept 4: Genuine Pre-estimation of Loss**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In the precedent case, the court examined whether the stipulated payment was a genuine pre-estimation of loss or a penalty. In our current case, the court will need to determine if the students' claims for refunds under the "5 Or Nothing" promotion are valid based on the terms and conditions provided.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF SHUN CHI COURT v. CITI-PRO PROPERTY SERVICES CO LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see a failure to properly plead and provide evidence to support claims (fact pattern i*), the court should decide in favor of the party that has provided a rational and logical basis for their claims (outcome o). This rule was justified in THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF SHUN CHI COURT v. CITI-PRO PROPERTY SERVICES CO LTD because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that parties properly plead and provide evidence to support their claims outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially dismissing valid claims that are not properly presented. This promotes fairness and clarity in legal proceedings, ensuring that all parties have a fair opportunity to present their case.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF SHUN CHI COURT v. CITI-PRO PROPERTY SERVICES CO LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Contractual Obligations and Pleading Requirements**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In the precedent case, Citi-Pro failed to properly plead and provide evidence to support its claims against the IO's computation. Similarly, in our current case, the landlord may argue that Vincent did not properly exercise the option to renew the lease due to the letter not reaching the landlord.

- **Legal Concept 2: Balance of Probabilities**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: The court in the precedent case accepted the IO's claim on the balance of probabilities due to the lack of contrary evidence from Citi-Pro. In our current case, the students may argue that X-Treme Learning breached the contract by not having Vincent teach the mathematics classes as advertised, and the court will need to determine this on the balance of probabilities.

- **Legal Concept 3: Interpretation of Contractual Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: The court in the precedent case interpreted the terms of the contract to determine whether the adjustments proposed by Citi-Pro were valid. In our current case, the court will need to interpret the terms and conditions of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion to determine if X-Treme Learning breached the contract.

- **Legal Concept 4: Genuine Pre-estimation of Loss**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In the precedent case, the court examined whether the stipulated payment was a genuine pre-estimation of loss or a penalty. In our current case, the court will need to determine if the students' claims for refunds under the "5 Or Nothing" promotion are valid based on the terms and conditions provided.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF SHUN CHI COURT v. CITI-PRO PROPERTY SERVICES CO LTD, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Proper Pleading and Evidence**: By requiring parties to properly plead and provide evidence to support their claims, the court promotes fairness and clarity in legal proceedings. This ensures that all parties have a fair opportunity to present their case and that decisions are made based on a rational and logical basis.

2. **Maintaining Contractual Integrity**: By interpreting contractual terms and obligations clearly, the court upholds the integrity of contractual agreements. This ensures that parties are held accountable to the terms they agreed upon, promoting trust and reliability in commercial transactions.

3. **Balancing Probabilities**: By deciding on the balance of probabilities, the court ensures that decisions are made based on the most likely scenario given the evidence presented. This promotes a fair and just outcome, even in the absence of absolute certainty.

4. **Preventing Unjust Enrichment**: By examining whether stipulated payments are genuine pre-estimations of loss or penalties, the court prevents parties from being unjustly enriched at the expense of others. This ensures that compensation is fair and proportionate to the actual loss suffered.

In conclusion, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF SHUN CHI COURT v. CITI-PRO PROPERTY SERVICES CO LTD, it would have the positive effects of ensuring proper pleading and evidence, maintaining contractual integrity, balancing probabilities, and preventing unjust enrichment.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF SHUN CHI COURT v. CITI-PRO PROPERTY SERVICES CO LTD**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of **properly disclosed and relevant evidence**. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as **ensuring fairness and clarity in legal proceedings**, outweighed any potential drawbacks because the court had a clear and rational basis for its decision. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of **properly disclosed and relevant evidence** is notably absent as the landlord did not receive Vincent's letter exercising the option to renew the lease, and there is no evidence that the landlord was aware of Vincent's intention to renew the lease.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor **(the landlord's offer of a 30% rent reduction upon renewal)** that was not present in **THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF SHUN CHI COURT v. CITI-PRO PROPERTY SERVICES CO LTD**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces an element of **conditional acceptance and negotiation** that was not present in the precedent case. Due to this factor, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as **potentially disregarding the landlord's conditional offer and the subsequent actions taken by both parties based on that offer** than positive ones, unlike in **THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF SHUN CHI COURT v. CITI-PRO PROPERTY SERVICES CO LTD** because the landlord's offer and Vincent's actions based on that offer create a different context that requires a nuanced interpretation of the lease agreement and the parties' intentions.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF SHUN CHI COURT v. CITI-PRO PROPERTY SERVICES CO LTD** should be stated as "When both **properly disclosed and relevant evidence** and **conditional acceptance and negotiation** are present, the court should decide in favor of the party that has provided a rational and logical basis for their claims." Omitting **conditional acceptance and negotiation** from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of **disregarding the landlord's conditional offer and the subsequent actions taken by both parties based on that offer**. Indeed, the opinion in **THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF SHUN CHI COURT v. CITI-PRO PROPERTY SERVICES CO LTD** explicitly states that **properly disclosed and relevant evidence** was crucial to their decision, highlighting the importance of considering all relevant factors in contractual disputes.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF SHUN CHI COURT v. CITI-PRO PROPERTY SERVICES CO LTD** was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of **parties failing to properly plead and provide evidence to support their claims, leading to unfair and unclear legal proceedings**. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence occurring because the issue revolves around **conditional acceptance and negotiation** rather than a failure to provide evidence. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should consider the unique context of the landlord's conditional offer and Vincent's actions based on that offer to reach a fair and just outcome.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of "properly disclosed and relevant evidence," which was present in the precedent case **THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF SHUN CHI COURT v. CITI-PRO PROPERTY SERVICES CO LTD**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of **contractual obligations and pleading requirements** would lead to the undesirable consequence of potentially disregarding the landlord's conditional offer and the subsequent actions taken by both parties based on that offer. Conversely, not requiring "properly disclosed and relevant evidence" would allow for a more nuanced interpretation of the lease agreement and the parties' intentions, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and equity in contract law. This approach ensures that the court considers the unique context of each case, promoting a just outcome based on the specific circumstances and actions of the parties involved.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of "properly disclosed and relevant evidence," which was present in **THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF SHUN CHI COURT v. CITI-PRO PROPERTY SERVICES CO LTD**, we have the additional factor of "conditional acceptance and negotiation." This "conditional acceptance and negotiation," when considered alongside the shared circumstances of **contractual obligations and pleading requirements**, serves a similar function to "properly disclosed and relevant evidence" in the precedent case. Given the presence of "conditional acceptance and negotiation," we submit that the reasoning in **THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF SHUN CHI COURT v. CITI-PRO PROPERTY SERVICES CO LTD** still applies, as the positive effects on **fairness and clarity in legal proceedings** would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. This ensures that the court upholds the integrity of contractual agreements while considering the specific context and actions of the parties involved, leading to a fair and just outcome.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF SHUN CHI COURT v. CITI-PRO PROPERTY SERVICES CO LTD**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations:

1. **Key Similarities**:
   - Both cases involve issues of contractual obligations and the necessity of proper pleading and evidence.
   - Both cases require the court to interpret contractual terms and determine the balance of probabilities.

2. **Key Differences**:
   - In the precedent case, there was a clear presence of properly disclosed and relevant evidence, which was crucial to the court's decision.
   - In the current case, there is a significant factor of conditional acceptance and negotiation, specifically the landlord's offer of a 30% rent reduction upon renewal, which was not present in the precedent case.

3. **Proposed Legal Rule**:
   - The rule from the precedent case suggests that when there is a failure to properly plead and provide evidence, the court should decide in favor of the party that has provided a rational and logical basis for their claims.

4. **Arguments from Both Sides**:
   - **For Applying the Precedent**: The precedent emphasizes the importance of proper pleading and evidence, which promotes fairness and clarity in legal proceedings.
   - **Against Applying the Precedent**: The current case involves conditional acceptance and negotiation, which introduces a different context that requires a nuanced interpretation of the lease agreement and the parties' intentions.

5. **Relevant Legal Principles**:
   - **Fairness and Clarity in Legal Proceedings**: Ensuring that parties properly plead and provide evidence to support their claims.
   - **Contractual Integrity**: Upholding the terms agreed upon by the parties.
   - **Conditional Acceptance and Negotiation**: Considering the specific context and actions of the parties involved.

### Final Decision

Considering the underlying legal principles and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the court should not strictly apply the rule from **THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF SHUN CHI COURT v. CITI-PRO PROPERTY SERVICES CO LTD** to the current case. Instead, the court should take into account the unique factor of conditional acceptance and negotiation present in the current case.

**For the Lease Issue**:
- The landlord's offer of a 30% rent reduction upon renewal and Vincent's actions based on that offer create a context of conditional acceptance and negotiation. Despite the letter not reaching the landlord, X-Treme Learning's continued operation and regular rental payments indicate an implied acceptance of the renewal terms. Therefore, the court should recognize the renewal of the lease at the agreed-upon reduced rate for the first year, followed by the full rate thereafter.

**For the Students' Claims**:
- The terms and conditions of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion, as provided in the welcome booklet, should be upheld. However, the court should consider whether the promotional materials created a reasonable expectation that Vincent would personally teach the mathematics classes. Given the circumstances of Vincent's illness and the employment of a substitute tutor, the court should determine if X-Treme Learning made reasonable efforts to fulfill its contractual obligations. The students' claims for refunds should be evaluated based on whether they met the conditions outlined in the welcome booklet and whether X-Treme Learning's substitution of the tutor was reasonable under the circumstances.

In conclusion, the decision reached balances the need for fairness and clarity in legal proceedings with the specific context of conditional acceptance and negotiation, ensuring a just outcome that aligns with legal precedent while considering the unique circumstances of the case.

### Minor Premise:

1. Trade Descriptions Ordinance Cap. 362 Section 13G Subsections 1-3:
   - X-Treme Learning engaged in a commercial practice that could constitute bait advertising by promoting the "5 Or Nothing" promotion.
   - The promotion advertised a refund if students did not achieve a score of 5.
   - There were no reasonable grounds for believing that X-Treme Learning would be able to offer the refund as advertised, given the unclear terms and conditions.
   - X-Treme Learning failed to offer the refund in a reasonable manner, as students were misled about the requirements (e.g., completing both compulsory and optional homework).

   Exceptions:
   - The advertisement did not clearly state the terms and conditions, nor where they could be found.

The students have legal claims against X-Treme Learning for misleading advertisements and failure to comply with the terms of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion. X-Treme Learning does not have a valid defence under Section 27.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD)

In the case of HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD [2022] HKCFI 2653; HCA 2973/2016 (precedent p), the court ruled that the defendant's (D's) claim of misrepresentation was not substantiated. The court found that the alleged misrepresentation was vague, not supported by contemporaneous documents, and contradicted by the defendant's own statements. Additionally, the court noted that the alleged representation was not included in the written agreement despite multiple rounds of negotiations. As a result, the court dismissed the misrepresentation claim and held that the defendant was not entitled to any damages based on the alleged misrepresentation.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Misrepresentation**: In both cases, there is an allegation of misrepresentation. In the precedent case, the defendant claimed that the plaintiff made representations about introducing investors. In the current case, students allege that Vincent Wong made representations about the "5 Or Nothing" promotion.
- **Legal Concept 2: Vagueness of Alleged Representations**: In the precedent case, the court found the alleged misrepresentation to be vague and not specific. Similarly, in the current case, the terms of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion were not clearly communicated in the advertisements.
- **Legal Concept 3: Lack of Contemporaneous Evidence**: In the precedent case, the court noted the absence of contemporaneous documents supporting the alleged misrepresentation. In the current case, there is a lack of clear documentation or communication to students about the specific requirements of the promotion.
- **Legal Concept 4: Written Agreement**: In the precedent case, the court emphasized that the alleged representation was not included in the written agreement despite multiple negotiations. In the current case, the terms and conditions of the promotion were not clearly stated in the advertisements, and students only received the detailed terms after contacting X-Treme Learning.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern where alleged representations are vague, not supported by contemporaneous evidence, and not included in a written agreement, the court should decide that the misrepresentation claim is not substantiated. This rule was justified in HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD because the positive effects (E+) of outcome o on the underlying values and principles of the law, such as the importance of clear and documented agreements and the prevention of unfounded claims, outweigh the negative effects (E-) in that case. 

Applying this rule to the current case, the students' claims for a refund under the "5 Or Nothing" promotion may not be substantiated if the alleged representations were vague, not clearly documented, and not included in the initial promotional materials. The court is likely to find that the students cannot claim a refund based on the precedent set in HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Misrepresentation**: In both cases, there is an allegation of misrepresentation. In the precedent case, the defendant claimed that the plaintiff made representations about introducing investors. In the current case, students allege that Vincent Wong made representations about the "5 Or Nothing" promotion.
- **Legal Concept 2: Vagueness of Alleged Representations**: In the precedent case, the court found the alleged misrepresentation to be vague and not specific. Similarly, in the current case, the terms of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion were not clearly communicated in the advertisements.
- **Legal Concept 3: Lack of Contemporaneous Evidence**: In the precedent case, the court noted the absence of contemporaneous documents supporting the alleged misrepresentation. In the current case, there is a lack of clear documentation or communication to students about the specific requirements of the promotion.
- **Legal Concept 4: Written Agreement**: In the precedent case, the court emphasized that the alleged representation was not included in the written agreement despite multiple negotiations. In the current case, the terms and conditions of the promotion were not clearly stated in the advertisements, and students only received the detailed terms after contacting X-Treme Learning.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Importance of Clear and Documented Agreements**: Upholding the requirement for clear and documented agreements ensures that all parties are aware of their obligations and rights, reducing the likelihood of disputes arising from misunderstandings or vague promises.
2. **Prevention of Unfounded Claims**: By dismissing claims based on vague and unsupported allegations, the court reinforces the principle that claims must be substantiated with clear evidence. This helps maintain the integrity of contractual relationships and discourages frivolous litigation.
3. **Consistency in Legal Outcomes**: Applying the same legal principles consistently across similar cases promotes fairness and predictability in the legal system. Parties can rely on established precedents to guide their actions and understand the likely outcomes of their disputes.

Therefore, based on the shared fact patterns and the positive effects on the underlying values and principles of the law, the court should find that the students' claims for a refund under the "5 Or Nothing" promotion are not substantiated. The students cannot claim a refund based on the precedent set in HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the alleged misrepresentation was not included in the written agreement despite multiple rounds of negotiations. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as the importance of clear and documented agreements and the prevention of unfounded claims, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it demonstrated that the parties had ample opportunity to include the representation in the contract but chose not to. However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as the terms and conditions of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion were not part of a negotiated written agreement but were instead included in a welcome booklet provided after students contacted X-Treme Learning. This means that the students did not have the same opportunity to negotiate or clarify the terms before committing to the promotion.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD. This factor is the explicit inclusion of terms and conditions in a welcome booklet provided to students after they expressed interest in the promotion. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces a documented set of terms that students received, albeit after initial contact, which could be argued to form part of the contractual agreement. Due to this factor, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the importance of providing clear terms and conditions to consumers and potentially allowing businesses to evade responsibility for vague promotional claims. Unlike in HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD, where the absence of written terms was a critical point, the presence of the welcome booklet in our case suggests that there was some effort to document the terms, which should be considered in evaluating the students' claims.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD should be stated as "When both [i*] (vague, unsupported, and unwritten alleged representations) and [m] (absence of a negotiated written agreement) are present, the court should decide [o] (the misrepresentation claim is not substantiated)." Omitting [m] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q] (undermining the importance of providing clear terms and conditions to consumers and potentially allowing businesses to evade responsibility for vague promotional claims). Indeed, the opinion in HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD explicitly states that the absence of the alleged representation in the written agreement despite multiple rounds of negotiations was crucial to their decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD was clearly designed to prevent [undesirable consequence u] (parties making unfounded claims based on vague and unsupported allegations). However, in our current case, there's no risk of [u] occurring because the terms and conditions of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion were documented in a welcome booklet provided to students after they expressed interest in the promotion. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The presence of the welcome booklet suggests that there was some effort to document the terms, which should be considered in evaluating the students' claims.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of a negotiated written agreement (m), which was present in the precedent case HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD, requiring this factor for all similar cases of vague, unsupported, and unwritten alleged representations (i*) would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would allow businesses to evade responsibility for vague promotional claims simply because the terms were not part of a negotiated written agreement. Conversely, not requiring the factor of a negotiated written agreement would allow for a more equitable outcome, ensuring that businesses are held accountable for the representations they make in their promotional materials, even if those representations are later documented in a welcome booklet. This better aligns with the underlying principles of consumer protection and fairness in contractual relationships.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of a negotiated written agreement (m), which was present in HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD, we have the additional factor of the welcome booklet (n) that clearly documents the terms and conditions of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion. This welcome booklet, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of vague, unsupported, and unwritten alleged representations (i*), serves a similar function to the negotiated written agreement in the precedent case. Given the presence of the welcome booklet, we submit that the reasoning in HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD still applies, as the positive effects on consumer protection and fairness in contractual relationships would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as allegations of misrepresentation, vagueness of alleged representations, lack of contemporaneous evidence, and the importance of written agreements. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the presence of a welcome booklet that documents the terms and conditions of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion, which was not a factor in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case—that misrepresentation claims are not substantiated when alleged representations are vague, unsupported, and not included in a written agreement—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in the context of consumer protection and fairness in contractual relationships.

We've weighed arguments from both sides. The initial analogy emphasizes the importance of clear and documented agreements to prevent unfounded claims, which is a strong point in favor of dismissing the students' claims. On the other hand, the rebuttal arguments highlight the significance of the welcome booklet as a form of documentation that should be considered in evaluating the students' claims, which is a compelling point for holding X-Treme Learning accountable for its promotional representations.

Considering the underlying legal principles of consumer protection, fairness in contractual relationships, and the need for clear and documented agreements, we conclude that the students' claims for a refund under the "5 Or Nothing" promotion should be partially substantiated. The presence of the welcome booklet, which documents the terms and conditions of the promotion, indicates that there was some effort to provide clear terms to the students, even if these terms were not part of a negotiated written agreement.

Therefore, X-Treme Learning should be held accountable for the representations made in the welcome booklet. However, the students' claims should be evaluated based on whether they met the documented requirements in the booklet, such as attending six uninterrupted months of lessons and completing all assigned homework, including both compulsory and optional homework. If students can demonstrate that they met these requirements and still did not achieve a score of 5, they should be entitled to a refund under the promotion.

This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by ensuring that businesses are held accountable for the representations they make in their promotional materials, thereby protecting consumers and maintaining fairness in contractual relationships.

### Minor Premise:

1. Residential Properties (First-hand Sales) Ordinance Cap. 621 Section 77 Subsection 1 and 2:
   - Not applicable as the scenario does not involve the purchase of a specified residential property.

2. Residential Properties (First-hand Sales) Ordinance Cap. 621 Section 75 Subsection 1:
   - Vincent made a statement in the promotional materials that students would be taught by him and would achieve a score of 5 or get a refund.
   - The statement was misleading as Vincent was not always available to teach, and the terms and conditions were not clearly disclosed in the advertisements.
   - Vincent intentionally omitted material facts (the terms and conditions) from the promotional materials, rendering the statement misleading.

3. Residential Properties (First-hand Sales) Ordinance Cap. 621 Section 75 Subsection 2:
   - Vincent recklessly made a statement that was misleading by not clearly disclosing the terms and conditions in the promotional materials.
   - The statement about the refund policy was rendered misleading due to the omission of material facts.

4. Securities and Futures Ordinance Cap. 571 Section 108 Subsection 1:

### Minor Premise:

1. FCL China Development Pte. Ltd. v Lai Yuen Ling:
- A representation was made by Vincent through the promotional materials that he would be teaching the mathematics courses.
- This representation was false as Vincent was not available to teach due to illness and a fresh graduate was employed instead.
- The representation induced students to enroll in X-Treme Learning Centre under the "5 Or Nothing" promotion.

   However:
   - The representation was credible as Vincent is a well-known tutor and it was reasonable for students to believe he would be teaching.
   - There is no indication that the students had an opportunity to verify the representation and failed to do so.

2. Yang Dandan v Hong Kong Resort Company Limited:
- The words and conduct (promotional materials featuring Vincent) led the students to believe that Vincent would be teaching the courses.
- It was reasonable for the students to believe this from the promotional materials as Vincent was prominently featured and no other tutors were shown.

   However:
   - The statement that Vincent would be teaching is not mere exaggerated praise or sales puff; it is a specific representation about who would be teaching the courses.

### Conclusion:

The students can claim misrepresentation based on the promotional materials featuring Vincent. The misrepresentation is actionable and may justify rescission of the contract.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA 900 and 945/2006)
In the case of HCA 900 and 945/2006 BETWEEN LEUNG YUK LIN trading as KING'S GLORY EDUCATIONAL CENTRE 1st Plaintiff and KARSON OTEN FAN, KARNO Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the defendant, Fan, was in breach of the terms and guidelines (TG) and general notes (GN) of his contract with King's Glory (KG) by failing to provide necessary details and approvals for his warrant system and advertisements. The court found that Fan's breaches, although technical and trivial in some respects, were substantial in others, particularly where they involved misrepresentations or unapproved advertisements. The court emphasized the importance of adhering to contractual obligations and the need for substantiation of claims made in advertisements.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA 900 and 945/2006 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Breach of Contractual Obligations**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (p):** Fan failed to provide necessary details and approvals for his warrant system and advertisements, breaching the TG and GN.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (c):** Vincent failed to ensure that the terms and conditions of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion were clearly communicated and adhered to, potentially breaching the contractual obligations with the students.

- **Legal Concept 2: Misrepresentation in Advertisements**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (p):** Fan's advertisement claimed his students had the most number of grades A, B, and C without substantiation, leading to a potential misrepresentation.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (c):** Vincent's "5 Or Nothing" promotion may have misled students by not clearly stating the terms and conditions in the advertisements, leading to potential misrepresentation.

- **Legal Concept 3: Requirement for Substantiation of Claims**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (p):** Fan was required to substantiate his claims about student grades but failed to do so.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (c):** Vincent may be required to substantiate the claims made in the "5 Or Nothing" promotion, particularly regarding the conditions for refunds.

- **Legal Concept 4: Consequences of Non-Compliance**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (p):** Fan's non-compliance with the TG and GN led to warnings and eventual legal action.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (c):** Vincent's non-compliance with clear communication of the promotion's terms and conditions could lead to student complaints and potential legal claims.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA 900 and 945/2006)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern involving breach of contractual obligations, misrepresentation in advertisements, requirement for substantiation of claims, and consequences of non-compliance, the court should decide that the party in breach is liable for the consequences of their actions. This rule was justified in HCA 900 and 945/2006 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring adherence to contractual obligations and preventing misrepresentation in advertisements outweigh the negative effects (E-) of holding the breaching party accountable. This promotes fairness, transparency, and trust in contractual relationships and advertising practices.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA 900 and 945/2006) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Breach of Contractual Obligations**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (p):** Fan failed to provide necessary details and approvals for his warrant system and advertisements, breaching the TG and GN.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (c):** Vincent failed to ensure that the terms and conditions of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion were clearly communicated and adhered to, potentially breaching the contractual obligations with the students.

- **Legal Concept 2: Misrepresentation in Advertisements**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (p):** Fan's advertisement claimed his students had the most number of grades A, B, and C without substantiation, leading to a potential misrepresentation.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (c):** Vincent's "5 Or Nothing" promotion may have misled students by not clearly stating the terms and conditions in the advertisements, leading to potential misrepresentation.

- **Legal Concept 3: Requirement for Substantiation of Claims**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (p):** Fan was required to substantiate his claims about student grades but failed to do so.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (c):** Vincent may be required to substantiate the claims made in the "5 Or Nothing" promotion, particularly regarding the conditions for refunds.

- **Legal Concept 4: Consequences of Non-Compliance**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (p):** Fan's non-compliance with the TG and GN led to warnings and eventual legal action.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (c):** Vincent's non-compliance with clear communication of the promotion's terms and conditions could lead to student complaints and potential legal claims.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCA 900 and 945/2006. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Adherence to Contractual Obligations:** By holding Vincent accountable for any breaches of contractual obligations, the court would reinforce the importance of adhering to agreed terms, thereby promoting fairness and reliability in contractual relationships.

2. **Preventing Misrepresentation in Advertisements:** By addressing potential misrepresentations in Vincent's promotional materials, the court would help maintain transparency and honesty in advertising practices, protecting consumers from misleading claims.

3. **Requiring Substantiation of Claims:** By requiring Vincent to substantiate the claims made in the "5 Or Nothing" promotion, the court would ensure that promotional statements are based on verifiable facts, thereby fostering trust and credibility in the educational services market.

4. **Consequences of Non-Compliance:** By imposing consequences for non-compliance, the court would deter future breaches and encourage parties to comply with their contractual and legal obligations, thereby promoting a more orderly and predictable business environment.

In conclusion, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA 900 and 945/2006, it would have the positive effects of promoting fairness, transparency, and trust in contractual relationships and advertising practices.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the pandemic's impact on business operations, that was not present in HCA 900 and 945/2006. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of breach of contractual obligations and misrepresentation in advertisements. Due to the pandemic, X-Treme Learning's business declined significantly, which led to Vincent's request for a rent reduction and the subsequent confusion about the lease renewal. This context of financial hardship and operational disruption due to an unprecedented global event was not a consideration in the precedent case.

Because of the pandemic's impact, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as unfairly penalizing X-Treme Learning for circumstances beyond its control, than positive ones. Unlike in HCA 900 and 945/2006, where the breaches were within the control of the parties involved, the pandemic introduces an element of force majeure that complicates the assessment of contractual compliance and the fairness of enforcing strict adherence to the lease terms. Therefore, the presence of the pandemic as a factor in our current case necessitates a different legal approach to ensure a fair and just outcome.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA 900 and 945/2006 should be stated as "When both [breach of contractual obligations and misrepresentation in advertisements] and [the impact of an unprecedented global event like the pandemic] are present, the court should decide [to consider the context of the global event and potentially mitigate the consequences of the breach]." Omitting [the impact of an unprecedented global event like the pandemic] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of unfairly penalizing parties for circumstances beyond their control, thereby causing undue hardship and potentially leading to unjust outcomes]. Indeed, the opinion in HCA 900 and 945/2006 explicitly states that the breaches were within the control of the parties involved, which was crucial to their decision. The pandemic introduces an element of force majeure that complicates the assessment of contractual compliance and the fairness of enforcing strict adherence to the lease terms.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA 900 and 945/2006 was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties making unsubstantiated claims and breaching contractual obligations without facing consequences]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [parties making unsubstantiated claims and breaching contractual obligations without facing consequences] occurring in the same manner because the pandemic has created an extraordinary situation that was not present in the precedent case. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The pandemic's impact necessitates a more nuanced approach that considers the extraordinary circumstances and aims to achieve a fair and just outcome.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of "strict adherence to contractual obligations without external disruptions," which was present in the precedent case HCA 900 and 945/2006, requiring this factor for all similar cases of breach of contractual obligations and misrepresentation in advertisements would lead to the undesirable consequence of unfairly penalizing parties for circumstances beyond their control, such as a global pandemic. Conversely, not requiring this factor would allow for a more equitable consideration of extraordinary circumstances, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and justice in contract law. This approach ensures that parties are not unduly punished for breaches that are significantly influenced by external, uncontrollable events.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of "strict adherence to contractual obligations without external disruptions," which was present in HCA 900 and 945/2006, we have the additional factor of "the impact of an unprecedented global event like the pandemic." This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of breach of contractual obligations and misrepresentation in advertisements, serves a similar function to the strict adherence factor in the precedent case. Given the presence of the pandemic's impact, we submit that the reasoning in HCA 900 and 945/2006 still applies, as the positive effects on fairness and justice would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. This ensures that the legal principles of equity and reasonableness are upheld, taking into account the extraordinary circumstances that have affected X-Treme Learning's operations.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA 900 and 945/2006, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the breach of contractual obligations and potential misrepresentation in advertisements. However, it also differs significantly due to the impact of the unprecedented global event, the COVID-19 pandemic, which was not a factor in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule of holding parties accountable for breaches of contractual obligations and misrepresentations in advertisements finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the extraordinary circumstances introduced by the pandemic.

### Lease Agreement

**Merits:**
- The lease agreement provided for a clear option to renew the lease, which Vincent attempted to exercise by posting a letter in April 2021.
- The landlord's offer of a 30% rent reduction for one year if the lease was renewed indicates a mutual understanding and modification of the original lease terms.

**Flaws:**
- The letter exercising the option to renew never reached the landlord, creating ambiguity about whether the option was validly exercised.
- X-Treme Learning continued to operate and make regular rental payments, which could imply acceptance of the renewal terms despite the letter not being received.

**Conclusion:**
Given the mutual understanding and the continued operation and payment of rent by X-Treme Learning, it is reasonable to conclude that the lease was effectively renewed. The landlord's subsequent demand for the full rent of $240,000 starting January 2022, after acknowledging the business's improvement, aligns with the modified terms agreed upon. Therefore, X-Treme Learning is legally obligated to pay the increased rent from January 2022.

### Student Claims

**Merits:**
- The promotional materials for the "5 Or Nothing" campaign did not clearly state the terms and conditions, potentially leading to misrepresentation.
- The requirement for both compulsory and optional homework to qualify for the promotion was not clearly communicated, causing confusion and dissatisfaction among students.
- The sudden replacement of Vincent with a less experienced tutor could be seen as a breach of the implied promise of premium teaching quality.

**Flaws:**
- The welcome booklet provided to students did outline the terms and conditions, including the requirement to complete all assigned homework and the disclaimer about the availability of specific instructors.
- The terms and conditions were printed in both Cantonese and English, in a readable font size, which could be argued as sufficient notice to the students.

**Conclusion:**
While there is a potential for claims of misrepresentation due to the lack of clarity in the promotional materials, the welcome booklet did provide the necessary terms and conditions. X-Treme Learning can argue that the students were adequately informed upon enrollment. However, the sudden change in instructor and the ambiguity regarding homework requirements could still lead to valid claims. X-Treme Learning should consider offering some form of compensation or clarification to address student grievances and mitigate potential legal action.

### Final Decision

Balancing these considerations, we conclude that:

1. **Lease Agreement:** X-Treme Learning is legally obligated to pay the increased rent of $240,000 from January 2022, as the lease renewal was effectively agreed upon through mutual understanding and continued operation.

2. **Student Claims:** While X-Treme Learning has a defense based on the welcome booklet's terms and conditions, the lack of clarity in the promotional materials and the sudden change in instructor could lead to valid claims. X-Treme Learning should address these issues proactively to avoid potential legal disputes.

This decision aligns with legal precedent while also considering the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic, ensuring a fair and just outcome.

Additionally, the requirement to complete all assigned homework, including optional homework, was clarified by Vincent. Therefore, X-Treme Learning has a strong defense against the students' claims.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA002786/2002 BETWEEN HARROTS LIMITED Plaintiff AND GREAT HOPE INVESTMENTS LIMITED 1st Defendant TYROL INVESTMENTS LIMITED 2nd Defendant)
In the case of HCA002786/2002 BETWEEN HARROTS LIMITED Plaintiff AND GREAT HOPE INVESTMENTS LIMITED 1st Defendant TYROL INVESTMENTS LIMITED 2nd Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that a mandatory injunction could be granted at an interlocutory stage if the balance of justice favored the plaintiff, even if the plaintiff could not establish a high degree of assurance that they would succeed at trial. The court emphasized the importance of maintaining the status quo and preventing irreparable harm.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA002786/2002 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Interpretation of Contractual Clauses**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA002786/2002, the court had to interpret clause 7.10 of the Joint Venture Agreement to determine whether the defendants were in breach. Similarly, in our current case, the interpretation of the lease agreement and the terms of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion are crucial.
- **Legal Concept 2: Breach of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA002786/2002, the court considered whether there was a breach of a negative covenant. In our current case, the students may claim a breach of contract due to the non-availability of Vincent as their instructor and the ambiguity in the promotion terms.
- **Legal Concept 3: Balance of Justice**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA002786/2002, the court weighed the balance of justice to decide whether to grant an interlocutory injunction. In our current case, the balance of justice will be considered in determining whether the students' claims are valid and whether X-Treme Learning's defenses are reasonable.
- **Legal Concept 4: Specific Performance and Injunctions**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCA002786/2002, the court discussed the appropriateness of granting a mandatory injunction, which is akin to specific performance. In our current case, the students may seek specific performance of the contract terms, i.e., having Vincent as their instructor.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA002786/2002)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a potential breach of contract and the need to interpret contractual clauses (i*), the court should decide based on the balance of justice and the potential for irreparable harm (outcome o). This rule was justified in HCA002786/2002 because the positive effects (E+) of maintaining the status quo and preventing irreparable harm to the plaintiff outweighed the negative effects (E-) of potentially granting an injunction that might later be found unwarranted. This balance ensures that the underlying values of fairness and equity in contract law are upheld.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA002786/2002 BETWEEN HARROTS LIMITED Plaintiff AND GREAT HOPE INVESTMENTS LIMITED 1st Defendant TYROL INVESTMENTS LIMITED 2nd Defendant) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Interpretation of Contractual Clauses**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA002786/2002, the court had to interpret clause 7.10 of the Joint Venture Agreement to determine whether the defendants were in breach. Similarly, in our current case, the interpretation of the lease agreement and the terms of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion are crucial. Specifically, the lease agreement's renewal clause and the terms and conditions of the promotion need to be interpreted to determine the parties' rights and obligations.

- **Legal Concept 2: Breach of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA002786/2002, the court considered whether there was a breach of a negative covenant. In our current case, the students may claim a breach of contract due to the non-availability of Vincent as their instructor and the ambiguity in the promotion terms. The students argue that they were promised Vincent as their instructor, and the terms of the promotion were not clearly communicated.

- **Legal Concept 3: Balance of Justice**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA002786/2002, the court weighed the balance of justice to decide whether to grant an interlocutory injunction. In our current case, the balance of justice will be considered in determining whether the students' claims are valid and whether X-Treme Learning's defenses are reasonable. The court will need to balance the students' expectations and the potential harm to X-Treme Learning if the students' claims are upheld.

- **Legal Concept 4: Specific Performance and Injunctions**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCA002786/2002, the court discussed the appropriateness of granting a mandatory injunction, which is akin to specific performance. In our current case, the students may seek specific performance of the contract terms, i.e., having Vincent as their instructor. The court will need to consider whether such an order is feasible and just.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach a similar outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA002786/2002, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Maintaining the Status Quo**: Granting relief that maintains the status quo until the trial can prevent irreparable harm to the students who enrolled based on the expectation that Vincent would be their instructor. This aligns with the principle of fairness and equity in contract law.

2. **Preventing Irreparable Harm**: Ensuring that the students' expectations are met, or at least that they are not misled, prevents potential irreparable harm to their educational outcomes and trust in contractual agreements.

3. **Balancing Interests**: The court's decision should balance the interests of both parties. While X-Treme Learning may face operational challenges, the students' right to receive what they were promised should also be protected.

4. **Clarity in Contractual Obligations**: Interpreting the contractual clauses clearly and enforcing them ensures that both parties understand their rights and obligations, reducing future disputes and promoting trust in contractual relationships.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach a similar outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA002786/2002, it would have the positive effects of maintaining the status quo, preventing irreparable harm, balancing interests, and providing clarity in contractual obligations.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the specific terms and conditions of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion, that was not present in HCA002786/2002 BETWEEN HARROTS LIMITED Plaintiff AND GREAT HOPE INVESTMENTS LIMITED 1st Defendant TYROL INVESTMENTS LIMITED 2nd Defendant. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of interpreting contractual clauses and potential breach of contract.

In HCA002786/2002, the court focused on the interpretation of a joint venture agreement and the balance of justice in granting an interlocutory injunction. The case did not involve specific promotional terms that could mislead consumers or create specific expectations about the service provided. In our current case, the "5 Or Nothing" promotion creates specific expectations among students that Vincent would be their instructor and that only compulsory homework needed to be completed to qualify for the promotion.

Due to the presence of these specific promotional terms, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as misleading students and potentially causing them to suffer educational and financial harm. Unlike in HCA002786/2002, where the focus was on maintaining the status quo and preventing irreparable harm in a commercial context, our case involves consumer protection and the need to ensure that promotional terms are clear and not misleading. Therefore, the presence of these specific promotional terms significantly alters the balance of positive and negative effects, making it inappropriate to apply the same outcome as in the precedent case.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA002786/2002 BETWEEN HARROTS LIMITED Plaintiff AND GREAT HOPE INVESTMENTS LIMITED 1st Defendant TYROL INVESTMENTS LIMITED 2nd Defendant should be stated as: "When both the interpretation of contractual clauses and the potential breach of contract are present, and specific promotional terms that could mislead consumers are also present, the court should decide based on the balance of justice and the potential for irreparable harm, ensuring that promotional terms are clear and not misleading." Omitting the specific promotional terms from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of misleading consumers and causing them to suffer educational and financial harm. Indeed, the opinion in HCA002786/2002 explicitly states that the balance of justice and preventing irreparable harm were crucial to their decision, which aligns with the need to protect consumers from misleading promotional terms.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA002786/2002 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of irreparable harm and to maintain the status quo in a commercial context. However, in our current case, there's no risk of the same type of irreparable harm occurring. Instead, the risk lies in misleading consumers through unclear promotional terms, which was not a factor in the precedent case. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—preventing commercial irreparable harm and maintaining the status quo—is not relevant to our situation, which involves consumer protection and the clarity of promotional terms.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the specific factor of a joint venture agreement with a negative covenant, which was present in the precedent case HCA002786/2002 BETWEEN HARROTS LIMITED Plaintiff AND GREAT HOPE INVESTMENTS LIMITED 1st Defendant TYROL INVESTMENTS LIMITED 2nd Defendant, requiring this factor for all similar cases of interpreting contractual clauses and potential breach of contract would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would limit the court's ability to address consumer protection issues and ensure clarity in promotional terms, which are crucial in our current case. Conversely, not requiring the presence of a joint venture agreement with a negative covenant would allow for a more flexible and equitable approach that better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, such as fairness, clarity, and the protection of consumer rights.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the specific factor of a joint venture agreement with a negative covenant, which was present in HCA002786/2002, we have the additional factor of specific promotional terms that could mislead consumers. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of interpreting contractual clauses and potential breach of contract, serves a similar function to the negative covenant in the precedent case. Given the presence of these specific promotional terms, we submit that the reasoning in HCA002786/2002 still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as consumer protection, clarity in contractual obligations, and fairness, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA002786/2002 BETWEEN HARROTS LIMITED Plaintiff AND GREAT HOPE INVESTMENTS LIMITED 1st Defendant TYROL INVESTMENTS LIMITED 2nd Defendant, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the need to interpret contractual clauses and the potential breach of contract. However, it also differs significantly in that it involves specific promotional terms that could mislead consumers, which was not a factor in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule of deciding based on the balance of justice and the potential for irreparable harm finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of maintaining the status quo and preventing irreparable harm (as emphasized in the precedent) and the need to ensure clarity in promotional terms to protect consumers (a crucial factor in the current case).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, equity, and consumer protection, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the court should prioritize the clarity of promotional terms and the protection of consumer rights in this instance. This approach aligns with the precedent's emphasis on preventing irreparable harm and maintaining the status quo but adapts it to the specific context of consumer protection.

Therefore, we determine that:

(a) **Lease Agreement**: X-Treme Learning has a legal right to continue occupying the premises under the renewed lease, given that they have been making regular rental payments and the landlord's acceptance of these payments implies consent to the renewal. However, X-Treme Learning should formally communicate with the landlord to resolve any misunderstandings regarding the renewal notice.

(b) **Student Claims**: The students may have valid claims for breach of contract due to the non-availability of Vincent as their instructor and the ambiguity in the promotion terms. X-Treme Learning's defense could include the clear terms stated in the welcome booklet and the disclaimer about the availability of instructors. However, the court is likely to consider the overall fairness and whether the promotional terms were sufficiently clear to the students.

In conclusion, the decision reached balances the need to uphold contractual obligations and the importance of clear and fair promotional practices, ensuring that justice and legal consistency are served.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD)

In the case of HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD (precedent p), the court ruled that the grant of an option was irrevocable once the conditions specified in the agreement were met, and that any attempt to introduce further conditions not stipulated in the agreement was impermissible. The court found that the option had been granted upon entering into the agreement and that the conditions for the grant were fulfilled by the specified dates.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Irrevocability of Granted Rights**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In the precedent case, the option was deemed irrevocable once granted and the conditions were met. In the current case, the lease renewal option was exercised by Vincent, and the landlord's subsequent acceptance of rent payments indicates that the option was effectively granted.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Fulfillment of Conditions**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In the precedent case, the court held that the conditions for the grant of the option were fulfilled by the specified dates. In the current case, Vincent's formal notice to extend the lease and the landlord's acceptance of rent payments fulfill the conditions for the lease renewal.

- **Legal Concept 3: Introduction of Additional Conditions**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In the precedent case, the court rejected the introduction of additional conditions not stipulated in the original agreement. In the current case, the landlord's attempt to impose the full rent of $240,000 after initially agreeing to a 30% reduction can be seen as an attempt to introduce additional conditions not originally agreed upon.

- **Legal Concept 4: Conduct and Acceptance**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In the precedent case, the conduct of the parties (e.g., public filings and board resolutions) indicated that the option was granted. In the current case, the landlord's acceptance of rent payments and the continued operation of X-Treme Learning indicate that the lease renewal was accepted.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of irrevocability of granted rights, fulfillment of conditions, rejection of additional conditions, and conduct indicating acceptance, the court should decide that the granted right (e.g., lease renewal or option) is valid and enforceable. This rule was justified in HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD because the positive effects (E+) of upholding the original agreement and preventing parties from reneging on their commitments outweighed the negative effects (E-) of allowing parties to introduce new conditions post-agreement. This promotes certainty and fairness in contractual relationships.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Irrevocability of Granted Rights**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In the precedent case, the option was deemed irrevocable once granted and the conditions were met. In the current case, Vincent exercised the option to renew the lease by formally writing to the landlord, and the landlord's acceptance of rent payments indicates that the option was effectively granted.

- **Legal Concept 2: Fulfillment of Conditions**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In the precedent case, the court held that the conditions for the grant of the option were fulfilled by the specified dates. In the current case, Vincent's formal notice to extend the lease and the landlord's acceptance of rent payments fulfill the conditions for the lease renewal.

- **Legal Concept 3: Introduction of Additional Conditions**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In the precedent case, the court rejected the introduction of additional conditions not stipulated in the original agreement. In the current case, the landlord's attempt to impose the full rent of $240,000 after initially agreeing to a 30% reduction can be seen as an attempt to introduce additional conditions not originally agreed upon.

- **Legal Concept 4: Conduct and Acceptance**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In the precedent case, the conduct of the parties (e.g., public filings and board resolutions) indicated that the option was granted. In the current case, the landlord's acceptance of rent payments and the continued operation of X-Treme Learning indicate that the lease renewal was accepted.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Promoting Certainty and Fairness in Contractual Relationships**: Upholding the original agreement and preventing parties from reneging on their commitments ensures that both parties can rely on the terms of their contract, promoting stability and predictability in commercial dealings.

2. **Preventing Unilateral Changes to Agreements**: By rejecting the introduction of additional conditions not stipulated in the original agreement, the court would prevent one party from unilaterally altering the terms of the contract to the detriment of the other party, thereby upholding the principle of mutual consent in contractual modifications.

3. **Encouraging Good Faith and Fair Dealing**: The landlord's acceptance of rent payments and the continued operation of X-Treme Learning indicate that both parties acted in accordance with the renewed lease. Recognizing this conduct as acceptance of the lease renewal promotes good faith and fair dealing in contractual relationships.

4. **Ensuring Commercial Practicality**: The court's decision would reflect the practical realities of the parties' conduct and the commercial context, ensuring that legal outcomes align with the parties' reasonable expectations and business practices.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD, it would have the positive effects of promoting certainty, fairness, good faith, and commercial practicality in contractual relationships.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the pandemic's impact on X-Treme Learning's business, that was not present in [HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD]. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of irrevocability of granted rights and fulfillment of conditions because the pandemic created extraordinary circumstances that affected the business operations and financial stability of X-Treme Learning.

Due to the pandemic's impact, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as unfairly penalizing X-Treme Learning for circumstances beyond its control, unlike in [HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD] where no such extraordinary circumstances were present. The pandemic's impact necessitates a more flexible approach to contractual obligations and conditions, recognizing the need for adjustments in light of unforeseen and uncontrollable events.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from [HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD] should be stated as 'When both [the irrevocability of granted rights and fulfillment of conditions] and [extraordinary circumstances such as a pandemic] are present, the court should decide [to allow flexibility in the enforcement of contractual obligations].' Omitting [extraordinary circumstances such as a pandemic] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of unfairly penalizing parties for circumstances beyond their control, thereby undermining the principles of fairness and equity in contractual relationships]. Indeed, the opinion in [HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD] implicitly assumes normal business conditions and does not account for extraordinary disruptions like a pandemic, which significantly alter the context and fairness of enforcing strict contractual terms.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in [HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD] was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties unilaterally introducing new conditions to renege on their commitments]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [one party unilaterally introducing new conditions to renege on their commitments] because the extraordinary circumstance of the pandemic necessitates a more flexible approach to contractual obligations. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should consider the impact of the pandemic and allow for adjustments to the contractual terms to ensure fairness and equity.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the specific factor of "formal written notice reaching the landlord," which was present in the precedent case [HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD], requiring this factor for all similar cases of lease renewals would lead to the undesirable consequence of penalizing parties for postal or communication failures beyond their control. Conversely, not requiring the formal written notice to have reached the landlord would allow for the desirable outcome of recognizing the parties' conduct and mutual understanding as sufficient to establish the renewal of the lease. This better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness, good faith, and commercial practicality in contractual relationships.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the specific factor of "formal written notice reaching the landlord," which was present in [HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD], we have the additional factor of "the landlord's acceptance of rent payments and the continued operation of X-Treme Learning." This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of the lease renewal option and the parties' conduct indicating acceptance, serves a similar function to the formal written notice in the precedent case. Given the presence of the landlord's acceptance of rent payments and the continued operation of X-Treme Learning, we submit that the reasoning in [HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD] still applies, as the positive effects on promoting certainty, fairness, good faith, and commercial practicality in contractual relationships would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to [HONG KONG ZHIXIN FINANCIAL NEWS AGENCY LTD v. CHINA MAPLE LEAF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LTD], the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the irrevocability of granted rights, fulfillment of conditions, rejection of additional conditions, and conduct indicating acceptance. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the impact of the pandemic on X-Treme Learning's business and the failure of the formal written notice to reach the landlord.

The proposed legal rule of upholding the original agreement and preventing parties from reneging on their commitments finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the need for flexibility in light of extraordinary circumstances like the pandemic and the importance of maintaining certainty and fairness in contractual relationships.

Considering the underlying legal principles of good faith, fairness, and commercial practicality, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the lease renewal should be recognized as valid and enforceable. The landlord's acceptance of rent payments and the continued operation of X-Treme Learning indicate that the lease renewal was effectively granted, despite the formal written notice not reaching the landlord. This decision aligns with the precedent while also accounting for the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic, ensuring a fair and just outcome.

Therefore, X-Treme Learning has the legal right to continue occupying the premises under the renewed lease terms, and the landlord's attempt to impose the full rent of $240,000 after initially agreeing to a 30% reduction is not permissible.

Regarding the students' claims, the terms and conditions of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion were clearly stated in the welcome booklet, which the students received upon enrollment. The requirement to complete both compulsory and optional homework was explicitly mentioned. Therefore, the students' failure to complete the optional homework disqualifies them from the promotion. X-Treme Learning can rely on the clear terms provided in the booklet as a defense against the students' claims.

In conclusion, X-Treme Learning's lease renewal is valid, and the students' claims regarding the "5 Or Nothing" promotion are not likely to succeed due to the clear terms and conditions provided. This decision balances the need for legal consistency with the principles of fairness and commercial practicality.

   - The advertisement must not be misleading or deceptive
   - The advertisement must comply with conditions imposed by the Commission for the use of advertisements by or on behalf of intermediaries

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Securities and Futures Ordinance Cap. 571 Section 168 Subsection 2(a):
- The advertisement issued by X-Treme Learning is not issued by an intermediary or on behalf of an intermediary.
- The advertisement does not relate to financial products.
- Therefore, this section does not apply.

### Conclusion:

The Securities and Futures Ordinance Cap. 571 Section 168 Subsection 2(a) does not apply to the scenario as the advertisement issued by X-Treme Learning is not issued by an intermediary or on behalf of an intermediary and does not relate to financial products.

### Conclusion on Legal Issue:

The small print in the advertisements stating that terms and conditions apply is not sufficient to incorporate those terms into the contract. The relevant ordinances do not apply to the scenario, and therefore, the terms and conditions in the small print are not legally binding on the students.

### Major Premise:

1. Bewise Motors Company Limited v Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd

   Conditions:
   - The standard terms are usual, common, and reasonable.
   - The reference to the standard terms, although in small print, is sufficient to incorporate them into the contract provided they are usual, common, and reasonable.

   Consequences:
   - The standard terms and conditions are incorporated into the contract.

   Exceptions:
   - The terms are unduly onerous or unreasonable.

2. CACV 185/2015 Lee Yuk Shing v Dianoor International Limited

   Conditions:
   - A contract contains an exemption clause.
   - The clause is particularly onerous or unusual.
   - The party seeking to enforce it has not shown that it was brought fairly and reasonably to the attention of the other party.

   Consequences:
   - The exemption clause may not be incorporated into the contract.

   Exceptions:
   - The clause is not particularly onerous or unusual.
   - Adequate notice of the clause has been given.

3. Chong Cheng Lin Courtney v Cathay Pacific Airways Limited

   Conditions:
   - The terms are set out in a handbook or similar document.
   - The document is of a type in which one may reasonably expect to find terms intended to be contractual.
   - The provisions in the document are regularly observed and understood to be binding.

   Consequences:
   - The terms may have contractual effect.

   Exceptions:
   - The document explicitly states that the terms are not legally binding.
   - The terms are in the nature of 'work rules' or managerial prerogatives.

### Minor Premise:

1. Bewise Motors Company Limited v Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd:
   - The terms in the welcome booklet are usual, common, and reasonable for a tutoring service.
   - The reference to the terms in the small print of the advertisements is not sufficient to incorporate them into the contract because the location of the terms was not specified.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

2. CACV 185/2015 Lee Yuk Shing v Dianoor International Limited:
   - The contract contains an exemption clause regarding the availability of any one instructor.
   - The clause is particularly onerous or unusual as students expected Vincent to teach.
   - The clause was not brought fairly and reasonably to the attention of the students as it was only in the welcome booklet and not in the advertisements.
   - Therefore, this section applies, and the exemption clause may not be incorporated into the contract.

3. Chong Cheng Lin Courtney v Cathay Pacific Airways Limited:
   - The terms are set out in a welcome booklet.
   - The welcome booklet is a type of document in which one may reasonably expect to find terms intended to be contractual.
   - The provisions in the booklet are regularly observed and understood to be binding.
   - The document does not explicitly state that the terms are not legally binding.
   - The terms are not in the nature of 'work rules' or managerial prerogatives.
   - Therefore, this section applies, and the terms in the welcome booklet may have contractual effect.

### Conclusion:

The small print in the advertisements stating that terms and conditions apply is not sufficient to incorporate those terms into the contract. However, the terms in the welcome booklet may have contractual effect, but the exemption clause regarding the availability of any one instructor may not be incorporated into the contract as it was not brought fairly and reasonably to the attention of the students.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (Bewise Motors Company Limited and Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd)
In the case of Bewise Motors Company Limited and Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd (precedent p), the court ruled that the standard terms and conditions, including limitation and Himalaya clauses, were incorporated into the contract despite being in small print, as long as they were usual, reasonable, and the parties were aware or should have been aware of their existence. The court also held that the limitation clauses were enforceable as reasonable and fair within the meaning of the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in Bewise Motors Company Limited and Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Incorporation of Terms by Reference**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In Bewise Motors, the terms were in small print but were considered incorporated because they were usual and reasonable, and the parties were aware or should have been aware of their existence. In our current case, the terms and conditions of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion were mentioned in small print in the advertisements.
- **Legal Concept 2: Reasonableness and Fairness of Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In Bewise Motors, the court assessed the reasonableness and fairness of the limitation clauses under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71. In our current case, the reasonableness and fairness of the terms and conditions of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion, particularly regarding the completion of both compulsory and optional homework, are in question.
- **Legal Concept 3: Notice of Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In Bewise Motors, the court considered whether the plaintiff had adequate notice of the terms and conditions. In our current case, the students received a welcome booklet detailing the terms and conditions after contacting X-Treme Learning, raising the issue of whether this constitutes adequate notice.
- **Legal Concept 4: Incorporation through Course of Dealing**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In Bewise Motors, the court considered the business environment and the expectation that standard terms would apply. In our current case, the business environment of private tutoring and the expectation that promotional terms would apply are relevant.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (Bewise Motors Company Limited and Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of terms being usual, reasonable, and the parties being aware or should have been aware of their existence (fact pattern i*), the court should decide that the terms are incorporated into the contract (outcome o). This rule was justified in Bewise Motors Company Limited and Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that commercial parties can rely on standard terms and conditions, which are usual and reasonable, outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially surprising one party with terms they did not explicitly agree to. This promotes certainty and fairness in commercial transactions, which are underlying values and principles of contract law.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (Bewise Motors Company Limited and Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Incorporation of Terms by Reference**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In Bewise Motors, the terms were in small print but were considered incorporated because they were usual and reasonable, and the parties were aware or should have been aware of their existence. In our current case, the terms and conditions of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion were mentioned in small print in the advertisements.

- **Legal Concept 2: Reasonableness and Fairness of Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In Bewise Motors, the court assessed the reasonableness and fairness of the limitation clauses under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71. In our current case, the reasonableness and fairness of the terms and conditions of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion, particularly regarding the completion of both compulsory and optional homework, are in question.

- **Legal Concept 3: Notice of Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In Bewise Motors, the court considered whether the plaintiff had adequate notice of the terms and conditions. In our current case, the students received a welcome booklet detailing the terms and conditions after contacting X-Treme Learning, raising the issue of whether this constitutes adequate notice.

- **Legal Concept 4: Incorporation through Course of Dealing**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In Bewise Motors, the court considered the business environment and the expectation that standard terms would apply. In our current case, the business environment of private tutoring and the expectation that promotional terms would apply are relevant.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in Bewise Motors Company Limited and Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Certainty in Commercial Transactions**: Ensuring that terms and conditions, even if in small print, are incorporated into contracts when they are usual, reasonable, and the parties are aware or should have been aware of their existence promotes certainty in commercial transactions. This is crucial in a competitive industry like private tutoring, where clear terms help manage expectations and responsibilities.

2. **Fairness and Reasonableness**: By assessing the reasonableness and fairness of the terms, the court ensures that neither party is unduly surprised or disadvantaged by hidden terms. This aligns with the principles of fairness and equity in contract law.

3. **Encouragement of Diligence**: This approach encourages parties to be diligent in reviewing and understanding the terms of their contracts, fostering a more informed and responsible business environment.

4. **Protection of Legitimate Business Practices**: Recognizing the incorporation of standard terms and conditions protects legitimate business practices and allows businesses to operate with a degree of predictability and security, which is essential for planning and investment.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in Bewise Motors Company Limited and Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd, it would have the positive effects of promoting certainty, fairness, diligence, and protection of legitimate business practices in the context of contract law.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor of **consumer protection** that was not present in [Bewise Motors Company Limited and Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd]. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of **incorporation of terms by reference** because the students enrolling in X-Treme Learning are consumers, not commercial entities. Due to this consumer context, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as **potential unfairness to consumers who may not have the same level of awareness or bargaining power as commercial entities** than positive ones, unlike in [Bewise Motors Company Limited and Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd] because **consumers are generally afforded greater protection under the law to prevent them from being unfairly bound by terms they were not adequately made aware of**.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from [Bewise Motors Company Limited and Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd] should be stated as 'When both [i*] (terms being usual, reasonable, and the parties being aware or should have been aware of their existence) and [m] (the context of commercial transactions between experienced business entities) are present, the court should decide [o] (that the terms are incorporated into the contract).' Omitting [m] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q] (unfairness to consumers who may not have the same level of awareness or bargaining power as commercial entities). Indeed, the opinion in [Bewise Motors Company Limited and Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd] explicitly states that the business environment and the expectation that standard terms would apply were crucial to their decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in [Bewise Motors Company Limited and Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd] was clearly designed to prevent [undesirable consequence u] (uncertainty and unfairness in commercial transactions where experienced business entities might be surprised by hidden terms). However, in our current case, there's no risk of [u] occurring because the students enrolling in X-Treme Learning are consumers, not commercial entities. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The context of consumer protection necessitates a different approach to ensure fairness and adequate notice of terms to individuals who may not have the same level of commercial awareness or bargaining power.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the context of commercial transactions between experienced business entities (factor m), which was present in the precedent case Bewise Motors Company Limited and Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd, requiring this factor for all similar cases of terms being usual, reasonable, and the parties being aware or should have been aware of their existence (fact pattern i*) would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would undermine the protection afforded to consumers, who may not have the same level of awareness or bargaining power as commercial entities. Conversely, not requiring the context of commercial transactions would allow for a more balanced approach that better aligns with the underlying principles of consumer protection in contract law. This approach ensures that consumers are not unfairly bound by terms they were not adequately made aware of, promoting fairness and transparency in consumer contracts.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the context of commercial transactions between experienced business entities (factor m), which was present in Bewise Motors Company Limited and Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd, we have the additional factor of consumer protection (factor n). This factor n, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of terms being usual, reasonable, and the parties being aware or should have been aware of their existence (fact pattern i*), serves a similar function to factor m in the precedent case. Given the presence of consumer protection, we submit that the reasoning in Bewise Motors Company Limited and Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd still applies, as the positive effects on fairness and transparency in consumer contracts would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. This ensures that consumers are adequately informed and protected, aligning with the principles of fairness and equity in contract law.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to Bewise Motors Company Limited and Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the incorporation of terms by reference, the reasonableness and fairness of terms, and the notice of terms. However, it also differs significantly in that the current case involves consumer protection, whereas the precedent involved commercial entities.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case—that terms being usual, reasonable, and the parties being aware or should have been aware of their existence are sufficient for incorporation—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in the context of consumer protection.

We've weighed arguments from both sides. The initial argument effectively highlights the importance of incorporating terms that are usual and reasonable, promoting certainty and fairness in commercial transactions. On the other hand, the rebuttal argument correctly points out that consumer protection necessitates a different approach, ensuring that consumers are not unfairly bound by terms they were not adequately made aware of.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, transparency, and consumer protection, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the terms and conditions of the "5 Or Nothing" promotion were not adequately incorporated into the contract with the students. The small print in the advertisements stating that terms and conditions apply is insufficient to incorporate those terms into the contract, especially given the consumer context.

Key factors that influenced this outcome include the need for greater protection for consumers, who may not have the same level of awareness or bargaining power as commercial entities, and the importance of ensuring that terms are clearly communicated and agreed upon in consumer contracts. Therefore, X-Treme Learning may face legal claims from students who were not adequately informed of the terms and conditions of the promotion.
