# Contract Law: Whether there was a valid offer of a reward by the restaurant owners

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HKSAR v So Kam Tim)
In the case of HKSAR v So Kam Tim (precedent p), the court dealt with the issue of whether the acceptance of a bribe or reward required the actual performance of the act for which the reward was given. The court ruled that the offence of accepting or soliciting a bribe is complete at the moment the bribe is accepted or solicited, regardless of whether the act for which the bribe was given is actually performed. The court emphasized that the state of mind of the person accepting or soliciting the bribe is what matters, not the actual performance of the act.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HKSAR v So Kam Tim and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Offer and Acceptance of Reward**: In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the court considered the acceptance of a bribe as an offer and acceptance of a reward for a corrupt act. In our current case, the restaurant owners made an offer of a reward for the recovery of the parrot, and Jack accepted this offer by providing the information.
- **Legal Concept 2: State of Mind**: In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the court focused on the state of mind of the person accepting the bribe. Similarly, in our current case, the state of mind of Jack and Imogen when they provided the information about the parrot is relevant.
- **Legal Concept 3: Performance of the Act**: In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the court ruled that the performance of the act for which the bribe was given is not necessary for the offence to be complete. In our current case, the actual recovery of the parrot by the owners is analogous to the performance of the act.
- **Legal Concept 4: Entitlement to Reward**: In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the court ruled that the entitlement to the bribe is based on the acceptance of the offer, not the performance of the act. In our current case, the entitlement to the reward should be based on the acceptance of the offer by providing the information, not the actual recovery of the parrot.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HKSAR v So Kam Tim)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of an offer and acceptance of a reward (i*), the court should decide that the entitlement to the reward is based on the acceptance of the offer, not the performance of the act (outcome o). This rule was justified in HKSAR v So Kam Tim because focusing on the state of mind and the acceptance of the offer aligns with the underlying values of preventing corruption and ensuring that offers of rewards are taken seriously. The positive effects (E+) of this outcome include promoting honesty and integrity in accepting offers of rewards, while the negative effects (E-) are minimal as the actual performance of the act is not the primary concern.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HKSAR v So Kam Tim) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Offer and Acceptance of Reward**: The restaurant owners made an offer of a reward for the recovery of the parrot, and Jack accepted this offer by providing the information about the parrot's location.
- **Legal Concept 2: State of Mind**: The state of mind of Jack and Imogen when they provided the information about the parrot is relevant. Jack knew about the reward and acted with the intention of claiming it.
- **Legal Concept 3: Performance of the Act**: The actual recovery of the parrot by the owners is analogous to the performance of the act. However, the focus should be on the acceptance of the offer by providing the information.
- **Legal Concept 4: Entitlement to Reward**: The entitlement to the reward should be based on the acceptance of the offer by providing the information, not the actual recovery of the parrot.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HKSAR v So Kam Tim. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Promoting Honesty and Integrity**: By focusing on the acceptance of the offer and the state of mind, the law promotes honesty and integrity in accepting offers of rewards. Jack acted with the intention of claiming the reward, and his actions should be recognized.
2. **Ensuring Seriousness of Offers**: Recognizing the acceptance of the offer as the basis for entitlement ensures that offers of rewards are taken seriously. The restaurant owners made a public offer, and Jack's acceptance of that offer should be honored.
3. **Preventing Unjust Enrichment**: By ensuring that the person who acted with the intention of claiming the reward is entitled to it, the law prevents unjust enrichment. Imogen, although she found the parrot, did not act with the knowledge of the reward and therefore did not accept the offer in the legal sense.

Therefore, Jack should be entitled to the reward money as he accepted the offer by providing the information about the parrot's location. Imogen, on the other hand, did not know about the reward at the time she found the parrot and therefore did not accept the offer in the legal sense. 

In conclusion, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HKSAR v So Kam Tim, it would have the positive effects of promoting honesty and integrity, ensuring the seriousness of offers, and preventing unjust enrichment.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the factor of **state of mind** of the person accepting or soliciting the bribe. The state of mind was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as promoting honesty and integrity and preventing corruption, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it focused on the intention behind the acceptance or solicitation of the bribe, rather than the actual performance of the act. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of **state of mind** is notably absent as the primary issue revolves around the **knowledge of the reward** at the time of finding the parrot, rather than the intention behind accepting or soliciting a bribe.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor **knowledge of the reward** that was not present in HKSAR v So Kam Tim. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the entitlement to the reward in our case hinges on whether Imogen or Jack knew about the reward at the time of their actions. Due to the presence of this factor, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as unjust enrichment and unfairness, unlike in HKSAR v So Kam Tim. In our case, Imogen did not know about the reward when she found the parrot, which means she did not act with the intention of claiming the reward. This significantly impacts the fairness of awarding the reward solely based on the acceptance of the offer by Jack, who knew about the reward but did not contribute to the actual recovery of the parrot. Therefore, the presence of the factor **knowledge of the reward** in our current case necessitates a different outcome to ensure fairness and prevent unjust enrichment.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HKSAR v So Kam Tim should be stated as "When both the offer and acceptance of a reward (i*) and the knowledge of the reward (m) are present, the court should decide that the entitlement to the reward is based on the acceptance of the offer, not the performance of the act (outcome o)." Omitting the knowledge of the reward (m) from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of unjust enrichment and unfairness. Indeed, the opinion in HKSAR v So Kam Tim explicitly states that the state of mind of the person accepting or soliciting the bribe was crucial to their decision, which aligns with the importance of knowledge of the reward in our current case.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HKSAR v So Kam Tim was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of corruption by focusing on the state of mind of the person accepting or soliciting the bribe. However, in our current case, there's no risk of corruption occurring. The primary issue is the fairness and entitlement to a reward based on the knowledge of the reward at the time of the act. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—preventing corruption—is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the focus should be on ensuring fairness and preventing unjust enrichment by considering the knowledge of the reward when determining entitlement.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of **state of mind** (m), which was present in the precedent case HKSAR v So Kam Tim, requiring this factor for all similar cases of **offer and acceptance of a reward** (i*) would lead to the undesirable consequence of unjust enrichment and unfairness. Conversely, not requiring **state of mind** (m) would allow for a fairer distribution of the reward based on the actual actions taken to recover the parrot, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and equity in contract law. By focusing on the knowledge of the reward and the actions taken, the law can ensure that those who contribute to the desired outcome are justly compensated.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of **state of mind** (m), which was present in HKSAR v So Kam Tim, we have the additional factor of **knowledge of the reward** (n). This **knowledge of the reward** (n), when considered alongside the shared circumstances of **offer and acceptance of a reward** (i*), serves a similar function to **state of mind** (m) in the precedent case. Given the presence of **knowledge of the reward** (n), we submit that the reasoning in HKSAR v So Kam Tim still applies, as the positive effects on fairness and equity would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. By ensuring that the reward is given to those who acted with the knowledge of the reward, the law promotes fairness and prevents unjust enrichment.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the legal concepts of offer and acceptance of a reward, the state of mind, and the performance of the act. However, it also differs significantly in the factor of knowledge of the reward at the time of the act, which was not present in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule from HKSAR v So Kam Tim, which focuses on the acceptance of the offer and the state of mind, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in the context of fairness and preventing unjust enrichment. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of the state of mind in the precedent case and the relevance of knowledge of the reward in the current case.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, equity, and the intention behind accepting offers of rewards, we conclude that the entitlement to the reward should be based on the knowledge of the reward at the time of the act, in addition to the acceptance of the offer. This ensures that those who contribute to the desired outcome with the knowledge of the reward are justly compensated, aligning with the principles of fairness and preventing unjust enrichment.

Therefore, in the current case, Imogen should be entitled to at least part of the reward money as she found the parrot, even though she did not know about the reward at the time. Jack, who knew about the reward and acted with the intention of claiming it, should also be entitled to a portion of the reward. The exact division of the reward can be determined based on their respective contributions to the recovery of the parrot.

In conclusion, the decision is reached by balancing the considerations of legal precedent, fairness, and equity. The key factors influencing the outcome are the knowledge of the reward and the actions taken to recover the parrot. This approach ensures a fair distribution of the reward and aligns with the principles of justice and legal consistency.


# Contract Law: Whether Imogen's finding of the parrot constitutes acceptance of the reward offer

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Theft Ordinance Cap. 210 Section 25

### Major Premise:

1. Theft Ordinance Cap. 210 Section 25

   Conditions:
   - Any public advertisement of a reward for the return of any goods which have been stolen or lost
   - The advertisement uses any words to the effect that no questions will be asked, or that the person producing the goods will be safe from apprehension or inquiry, or that any money paid for the purchase of the goods or advanced by way of loan on them will be repaid

   Consequences:
   - The person advertising the reward and any person who prints or publishes the advertisement shall be guilty of an offence
   - Shall be liable on conviction to a fine at level 1

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Theft Ordinance Cap. 210 Section 25:
- The owners of the Blue Parrot restaurant have publicly advertised a reward for the return of their lost parrot.
- The advertisement does not use any words to the effect that no questions will be asked, or that the person producing the goods will be safe from apprehension or inquiry, or that any money paid for the purchase of the goods or advanced by way of loan on them will be repaid.
- Therefore, the advertisement does not fall under the conditions that would make it an offence under the Theft Ordinance Cap. 210 Section 25.

### Conclusion:

The advertisement for the reward does not violate the Theft Ordinance Cap. 210 Section 25, as it does not contain any prohibited language. Therefore, the legal issue of whether Imogen's finding of the parrot constitutes acceptance of the reward offer must be analyzed under general principles of contract law.

### Contract Law Analysis:

1. Offer and Acceptance:
   - The reward poster constitutes a unilateral offer to the public.
   - Imogen, by finding and securing the parrot, has performed the act requested by the offer, which constitutes acceptance.

2. Knowledge of the Offer:
   - For a reward to be claimed, the person performing the requested act must have knowledge of the offer at the time of performing the act.
   - Imogen did not know of the reward when she found the parrot, so her actions cannot be considered acceptance of the offer.

3. Jack's Claim:
   - Jack knew of the reward and reported the parrot's location to the owners.
   - However, Jack did not perform the act of finding and securing the parrot; Imogen did.

### Conclusion:

Imogen has no legal claim to the reward money because she did not know of the reward when she found the parrot, and thus her actions do not constitute acceptance of the offer. Jack also has no legal claim to the reward money because he did not perform the act of finding and securing the parrot. Therefore, neither Imogen nor Jack is entitled to the reward money offered by the owners of the Blue Parrot restaurant.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HKSAR v So Kam Tim)

In the case of HKSAR v So Kam Tim (precedent p), the court dealt with the issue of whether the acceptance of a corrupt reward required the actual performance of the act for which the reward was given. The court ruled that the offence of accepting an advantage is complete at the moment the advantage is accepted, regardless of whether the act for which the advantage was given is performed. The court emphasized that the state of mind of the person accepting the advantage is what matters, not the actual performance of the act.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in HKSAR v So Kam Tim and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Offer and Acceptance in Contract Law**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the court considered whether the acceptance of a corrupt reward required the actual performance of the act. Similarly, in our current case, we need to determine whether Imogen's finding of the parrot constitutes acceptance of the reward offer.

- **Legal Concept 2: State of Mind and Intention**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the court focused on the state of mind of the person accepting the advantage. In our current case, we need to consider whether Imogen's lack of knowledge about the reward affects her entitlement to it.

- **Legal Concept 3: Completion of the Offence/Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the offence was considered complete upon acceptance of the advantage, regardless of subsequent actions. In our current case, we need to determine if the contract (reward offer) is complete upon Imogen finding the parrot, regardless of her knowledge of the reward.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HKSAR v So Kam Tim)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of an offer being made and an act being performed that fulfills the conditions of the offer, the court should decide that the contract is complete and the reward is due, regardless of the offeree's knowledge of the reward. This rule was justified in HKSAR v So Kam Tim because the positive effects (E+) of focusing on the state of mind and the act of acceptance (or performance) outweigh the negative effects (E-) of requiring additional proof of knowledge or subsequent actions. This approach upholds the principles of fairness and the integrity of contractual offers, ensuring that individuals who perform the required act are entitled to the promised reward, thereby promoting trust and reliability in contractual dealings.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HKSAR v So Kam Tim) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Offer and Acceptance in Contract Law**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the court considered whether the acceptance of a corrupt reward required the actual performance of the act. Similarly, in our current case, we need to determine whether Imogen's finding of the parrot constitutes acceptance of the reward offer.

- **Legal Concept 2: State of Mind and Intention**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the court focused on the state of mind of the person accepting the advantage. In our current case, we need to consider whether Imogen's lack of knowledge about the reward affects her entitlement to it.

- **Legal Concept 3: Completion of the Offence/Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the offence was considered complete upon acceptance of the advantage, regardless of subsequent actions. In our current case, we need to determine if the contract (reward offer) is complete upon Imogen finding the parrot, regardless of her knowledge of the reward.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HKSAR v So Kam Tim, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Promoting Fairness and Integrity in Contractual Offers:**
   - By upholding the principle that the act of finding the parrot constitutes acceptance of the reward offer, the court would ensure that individuals who perform the required act are entitled to the promised reward. This promotes trust and reliability in contractual dealings.

2. **Encouraging Public Participation in Reward Offers:**
   - If the court rules that Imogen is entitled to the reward despite her lack of knowledge about it at the time of finding the parrot, it would encourage the public to act in good faith when they come across similar situations. This would enhance the effectiveness of reward offers as a tool for achieving desired outcomes.

3. **Simplifying Legal Requirements for Reward Claims:**
   - Requiring proof of knowledge of the reward at the time of performing the act would complicate the legal process and potentially discourage individuals from participating in reward offers. By focusing on the act itself, the court simplifies the legal requirements and makes it easier for individuals to claim rewards.

4. **Consistency with Established Legal Principles:**
   - The precedent set in HKSAR v So Kam Tim emphasizes the importance of the state of mind and the act of acceptance (or performance) in determining the completion of an offence or contract. Applying the same principles to the current case ensures consistency in legal reasoning and upholds established legal principles.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HKSAR v So Kam Tim, it would have the positive effects of promoting fairness, encouraging public participation, simplifying legal requirements, and ensuring consistency with established legal principles.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, **the lack of knowledge of the reward by Imogen at the time of finding the parrot**, that was not present in HKSAR v So Kam Tim. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because, in the precedent case, the focus was on the state of mind of the person accepting the advantage, which was crucial in determining the completion of the offence. In our current case, Imogen's lack of knowledge about the reward at the time of finding the parrot means she did not perform the act with the intention of claiming the reward.

Due to this lack of knowledge, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the principle that a reward offer must be knowingly accepted to form a binding contract. Unlike in HKSAR v So Kam Tim, where the acceptance of a corrupt reward was complete upon acceptance regardless of subsequent actions, in our case, the reward offer requires the offeree to be aware of the offer to form a valid contract. This ensures that the offeree's actions are motivated by the reward, thereby upholding the integrity of contractual agreements and preventing unjust enrichment.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from HKSAR v So Kam Tim should be stated as: "When both the act of acceptance and the state of mind of the person accepting the advantage are present, the court should decide that the offence is complete." Omitting the state of mind from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of unjust enrichment, where individuals could claim rewards or advantages without having the requisite intention or knowledge, thereby undermining the integrity of contractual agreements. Indeed, the opinion in HKSAR v So Kam Tim explicitly states that the state of mind of the person accepting the advantage was crucial to their decision: "It is the state of mind of the defendant which is material."

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in HKSAR v So Kam Tim was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of convicting individuals without considering their state of mind, thereby ensuring that only those with a corrupt intention are penalized. However, in our current case, there's no risk of unjust enrichment occurring if we do not apply the same rule. Imogen's lack of knowledge about the reward at the time of finding the parrot means she did not perform the act with the intention of claiming the reward. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—ensuring that the state of mind is considered in determining the completion of an offence—is not relevant to our situation. The focus should instead be on whether Imogen's actions, performed without knowledge of the reward, can constitute acceptance of the reward offer, which they cannot.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of Imogen's knowledge of the reward at the time of finding the parrot, which was present in the precedent case HKSAR v So Kam Tim, requiring this factor for all similar cases of reward claims would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would discourage individuals from acting in good faith and performing beneficial acts without first ensuring they are aware of any potential rewards. Conversely, not requiring knowledge of the reward would allow for a more equitable outcome, ensuring that individuals who perform the required act are entitled to the promised reward, thereby promoting fairness and encouraging public participation in reward offers. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which aim to uphold the integrity of offers and ensure that those who fulfill the conditions of an offer are duly rewarded.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of Imogen's knowledge of the reward at the time of finding the parrot, which was present in HKSAR v So Kam Tim, we have the additional factor of Jack's knowledge and subsequent actions. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of the reward offer and the act of finding the parrot, serves a similar function to the knowledge factor in the precedent case. Given the presence of Jack's knowledge and actions, we submit that the reasoning in HKSAR v So Kam Tim still applies, as the positive effects on promoting fairness, encouraging public participation, and simplifying legal requirements would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. Jack's actions in reporting the parrot and arranging for its collection demonstrate an intention to fulfill the conditions of the reward offer, thereby justifying a claim to the reward money.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in the context of offer and acceptance in contract law, the state of mind and intention of the parties involved, and the completion of the contract or offence. However, it also differs significantly in that Imogen was unaware of the reward at the time she found the parrot, which is a crucial factor in determining her entitlement to the reward.

The proposed legal rule from HKSAR v So Kam Tim—that the acceptance of an advantage is complete at the moment the advantage is accepted, regardless of subsequent actions—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in the context of reward offers where the offeree's knowledge of the reward is typically a critical element.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that requiring knowledge of the reward at the time of performing the act ensures the integrity of contractual agreements and prevents unjust enrichment. Conversely, the argument that focusing solely on the act itself promotes fairness and encourages public participation in reward offers also holds merit.

Considering the underlying legal principles of contract law, which emphasize the importance of mutual assent and the intention to create legal relations, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Imogen does not have a legal claim to the reward money offered. Her lack of knowledge about the reward at the time of finding the parrot means she did not perform the act with the intention of claiming the reward, which is a necessary element for forming a binding contract in the context of reward offers.

However, Jack, who was aware of the reward and took steps to report the parrot and arrange for its collection, does have a legal claim to the reward money. His actions demonstrate an intention to fulfill the conditions of the reward offer, thereby justifying his entitlement to the reward.

Therefore, the final decision is that Imogen is not entitled to the reward money, but Jack is entitled to claim the reward for his actions in reporting the parrot and arranging for its collection. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by ensuring that those who fulfill the conditions of an offer with the requisite knowledge and intention are duly rewarded.


# Contract Law: Whether Imogen's lack of knowledge of the reward at the time of finding the parrot affects her entitlement to the reward

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HKSAR v So Kam Tim)

In the case of HKSAR v So Kam Tim (precedent p), the court dealt with the issue of whether the state of mind of the person offering or accepting a bribe was relevant to the offence under the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance. The court ruled that the state of mind of the person offering the bribe was crucial, and it was not necessary to prove that the act for which the bribe was offered was actually performed. The court emphasized that the offence was complete upon the offer or acceptance of the bribe, regardless of whether the intended act was carried out.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in HKSAR v So Kam Tim and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Offer and Acceptance of Reward/Advantage**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the court considered the offer and acceptance of a bribe as the central issue. In the current case, the offer of a reward for the recovery of the parrot and the actions taken by Jack and Imogen to claim the reward are central issues.

- **Legal Concept 2: State of Mind and Knowledge**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the court focused on the state of mind of the person offering the bribe. In the current case, the state of mind and knowledge of Imogen at the time she found the parrot are crucial to determining her entitlement to the reward.

- **Legal Concept 3: Completion of the Offence/Entitlement**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the offence was considered complete upon the offer or acceptance of the bribe, regardless of whether the act was performed. In the current case, the question is whether Imogen's lack of knowledge of the reward at the time of finding the parrot affects her entitlement to the reward.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HKSAR v So Kam Tim)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of an offer and acceptance of a reward or advantage, the court should decide based on the state of mind and knowledge of the parties involved. This rule was justified in HKSAR v So Kam Tim because the court emphasized the importance of the state of mind in determining the completion of the offence, which aligns with the underlying values of ensuring that the intent behind actions is considered in legal determinations.

Applying this rule to the current case, we can argue that Imogen's lack of knowledge of the reward at the time she found the parrot should not necessarily disqualify her from claiming the reward. The key consideration should be whether her actions contributed to the recovery of the parrot and whether she had a reasonable expectation of a reward once she became aware of it. Therefore, both Imogen and Jack may have valid claims to the reward money, with the court needing to balance their contributions and expectations.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HKSAR v So Kam Tim) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Offer and Acceptance of Reward/Advantage**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the court considered the offer and acceptance of a bribe as the central issue. In the current case, the offer of a reward for the recovery of the parrot and the actions taken by Jack and Imogen to claim the reward are central issues.

- **Legal Concept 2: State of Mind and Knowledge**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the court focused on the state of mind of the person offering the bribe. In the current case, the state of mind and knowledge of Imogen at the time she found the parrot are crucial to determining her entitlement to the reward.

- **Legal Concept 3: Completion of the Offence/Entitlement**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the offence was considered complete upon the offer or acceptance of the bribe, regardless of whether the act was performed. In the current case, the question is whether Imogen's lack of knowledge of the reward at the time of finding the parrot affects her entitlement to the reward.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach a similar outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HKSAR v So Kam Tim, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Recognition of Contribution:** Just as the court in HKSAR v So Kam Tim recognized the importance of the state of mind in determining the completion of the offence, recognizing Imogen's contribution to the recovery of the parrot, regardless of her initial knowledge of the reward, aligns with the principle of fairness. Imogen's actions directly led to the recovery of the parrot, and thus she should be entitled to the reward.

2. **Encouragement of Honesty and Good Deeds:** By awarding the reward to Imogen, the court would encourage individuals to act honestly and report found items or animals, knowing that their efforts will be recognized and rewarded, even if they were initially unaware of any reward.

3. **Equitable Distribution:** Given that Jack also played a role in reporting the parrot, the court could consider an equitable distribution of the reward between Jack and Imogen. This would ensure that both parties are fairly compensated for their contributions, promoting a sense of justice and equity.

4. **Clarity in Reward Claims:** This decision would provide clarity in future cases involving reward claims, establishing that the key consideration is the contribution to the recovery or resolution, rather than the initial knowledge of the reward. This would help in reducing disputes and ensuring smoother resolution of similar cases.

Therefore, both Imogen and Jack may have valid claims to the reward money, with the court needing to balance their contributions and expectations. Given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach a similar outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HKSAR v So Kam Tim, it would have the positive effects of recognizing contributions, encouraging honesty, ensuring equitable distribution, and providing clarity in reward claims.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case

In the precedent case HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the factor of **"state of mind of the person offering or accepting a bribe"**. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as **recognizing the intent behind actions and ensuring that the legal system addresses the root of corrupt behavior**, outweighed any potential drawbacks, such as **the difficulty in proving the actual performance of the corrupt act**. The court emphasized that the offence was complete upon the offer or acceptance of the bribe, regardless of whether the intended act was carried out, thus focusing on the intent and state of mind.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of **"state of mind at the time of the offer or acceptance"** is notably absent. Imogen's lack of knowledge of the reward at the time she found the parrot means that her state of mind did not include any intent to claim a reward. This absence of intent to claim a reward at the time of finding the parrot significantly alters the situation because the legal principle of rewarding someone for their actions typically requires some form of intent or knowledge of the reward.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case

Our current case involves an important factor **"subsequent knowledge and actions taken to claim the reward"** that was not present in HKSAR v So Kam Tim. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of **"offer and acceptance of a reward/advantage"**. Because of **Imogen's subsequent knowledge of the reward and her actions to facilitate the recovery of the parrot**, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as **discouraging individuals from reporting found items or animals if they were initially unaware of any reward**, than positive ones, unlike in HKSAR v So Kam Tim. In the precedent case, the focus was on the initial intent and state of mind, whereas in the current case, the subsequent actions and knowledge play a crucial role in determining entitlement to the reward.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from HKSAR v So Kam Tim should be stated as: "When both the offer and acceptance of a reward/advantage and the state of mind of the person offering or accepting the reward/advantage are present, the court should decide based on the state of mind and knowledge of the parties involved." Omitting the state of mind from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of unfairly disqualifying individuals from claiming rewards or advantages they rightfully contributed to, simply because they were initially unaware of the reward. Indeed, the opinion in HKSAR v So Kam Tim explicitly states that the state of mind was crucial to their decision, as it emphasized the importance of intent in determining the completion of the offence.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in HKSAR v So Kam Tim was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of ignoring the intent behind actions, which could lead to unjust outcomes where individuals are punished or disqualified based on technicalities rather than their actual intent and contribution. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring. Imogen's subsequent knowledge of the reward and her actions to facilitate the recovery of the parrot demonstrate her contribution to the outcome. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—ensuring that intent and contribution are recognized—is not relevant to our situation where the focus should be on the actual contribution to the recovery of the parrot.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of "state of mind at the time of the offer or acceptance," which was present in the precedent case HKSAR v So Kam Tim, requiring this factor for all similar cases of "offer and acceptance of a reward/advantage" would lead to the undesirable consequence of unfairly disqualifying individuals from claiming rewards they rightfully contributed to, simply because they were initially unaware of the reward. Conversely, not requiring the state of mind at the time of the offer or acceptance would allow for a more equitable distribution of rewards based on actual contributions, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and recognition of efforts in the law.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of "state of mind at the time of the offer or acceptance," which was present in HKSAR v So Kam Tim, we have the additional factor of "subsequent knowledge and actions taken to claim the reward." This subsequent knowledge and actions taken by Imogen and Jack, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of "offer and acceptance of a reward/advantage," serve a similar function to the state of mind in the precedent case. Given the presence of subsequent knowledge and actions, we submit that the reasoning in HKSAR v So Kam Tim still applies, as the positive effects on fairness and recognition of contributions would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in the legal concepts of offer and acceptance of a reward/advantage and the importance of state of mind and knowledge. However, it also differs significantly in that Imogen was unaware of the reward at the time she found the parrot, which was not a factor in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule from HKSAR v So Kam Tim emphasizes the importance of the state of mind of the person offering or accepting a reward/advantage. This rule finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the argument that Imogen's subsequent knowledge and actions should be considered (a strong point for Imogen) and the argument that initial knowledge of the reward is crucial for entitlement (a strong point for the owners).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, recognition of contributions, and the intent behind actions, we conclude that Imogen should be entitled to at least a portion of the reward. While her initial lack of knowledge of the reward is a significant factor, her subsequent actions and the fact that her discovery directly led to the recovery of the parrot cannot be ignored. Jack, having facilitated the reporting of the parrot, also has a valid claim to a portion of the reward.

Therefore, the reward should be equitably distributed between Imogen and Jack, recognizing both their contributions to the recovery of the parrot. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by ensuring that contributions are fairly recognized and rewarded, even if the initial knowledge of the reward was absent.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (CACC457/2003 BETWEEN HKSAR Respondent and WU WING KAI (胡詠紀) 1st Applicant LAU TUNG CHEE ALAN (劉東馳) 2nd Applicant)
In the case of CACC457/2003 BETWEEN HKSAR Respondent and WU WING KAI (胡詠紀) 1st Applicant LAU TUNG CHEE ALAN (劉東馳) 2nd Applicant (precedent p), the court ruled that the failure by the prosecution to disclose the fact that a key witness had lodged a petition for remission of his sentence was a material irregularity in the conduct of the trial. The court emphasized the prosecution's duty to disclose relevant material that could affect the credibility of a witness, and determined that the non-disclosure was not inadvertent but a considered decision. The court concluded that this failure to disclose was a material irregularity that could have impacted the fairness of the trial.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in CACC457/2003 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Duty of Disclosure**: In CACC457/2003, the prosecution had a duty to disclose material that could affect the credibility of a witness. In the current case, there is a duty to disclose the existence of a reward for the recovery of the parrot.
- **Legal Concept 2: Material Irregularity**: In CACC457/2003, the non-disclosure of the petition for remission was considered a material irregularity. In the current case, the non-disclosure of the reward by Jack to Imogen could be seen as a material irregularity in their agreement.
- **Legal Concept 3: Impact on Fairness**: In CACC457/2003, the non-disclosure impacted the fairness of the trial. In the current case, the non-disclosure of the reward impacts the fairness of the distribution of the reward money between Jack and Imogen.
- **Legal Concept 4: Credibility and Motivation**: In CACC457/2003, the credibility of the witness was in question due to the undisclosed petition. In the current case, the motivation behind Jack's actions could be questioned due to the undisclosed reward.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (CACC457/2003)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern involving the non-disclosure of material information that could affect the fairness of an agreement or proceeding, the court should decide that such non-disclosure constitutes a material irregularity. This rule was justified in CACC457/2003 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring fairness and transparency in legal proceedings and agreements outweigh the negative effects (E-) of any inadvertent non-disclosure.

Applying this rule to the current case, the non-disclosure of the reward by Jack to Imogen constitutes a material irregularity. Therefore, Imogen has a valid claim to at least part of the reward money, as the fairness of the agreement between Jack and Imogen was compromised by Jack's failure to disclose the reward.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (CACC457/2003) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Duty of Disclosure**: In CACC457/2003, the prosecution had a duty to disclose material that could affect the credibility of a witness. In the current case, Jack had a duty to disclose the existence of the reward for the recovery of the parrot to Imogen.
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: Jack knew about the reward but did not inform Imogen, who found the parrot.

- **Legal Concept 2: Material Irregularity**: In CACC457/2003, the non-disclosure of the petition for remission was considered a material irregularity. In the current case, the non-disclosure of the reward by Jack to Imogen could be seen as a material irregularity in their agreement.
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: Jack's failure to disclose the reward to Imogen before arranging for the parrot's collection.

- **Legal Concept 3: Impact on Fairness**: In CACC457/2003, the non-disclosure impacted the fairness of the trial. In the current case, the non-disclosure of the reward impacts the fairness of the distribution of the reward money between Jack and Imogen.
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: Imogen was unaware of the reward when she found the parrot and thus could not make an informed decision about reporting it.

- **Legal Concept 4: Credibility and Motivation**: In CACC457/2003, the credibility of the witness was in question due to the undisclosed petition. In the current case, the motivation behind Jack's actions could be questioned due to the undisclosed reward.
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: Jack's actions in reporting the parrot were motivated by the reward, which he did not disclose to Imogen.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome: that the non-disclosure of the reward by Jack constitutes a material irregularity. This decision would be justified because, as in CACC457/2003, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Fairness**: Just as the court in CACC457/2003 emphasized the importance of fairness in legal proceedings, applying the same principle here ensures that Imogen is treated fairly. She should have been informed about the reward to make an informed decision about reporting the parrot.

2. **Promoting Transparency**: The decision would promote transparency in agreements and actions, ensuring that all parties are aware of material information that could affect their decisions.

3. **Upholding Legal Duties**: The decision reinforces the duty of individuals to disclose material information that could impact the fairness of an agreement or proceeding, similar to the prosecution's duty in CACC457/2003.

4. **Preventing Unjust Enrichment**: By recognizing Imogen's claim to at least part of the reward, the court would prevent Jack from unjustly enriching himself at Imogen's expense, given that she was the one who found the parrot.

Therefore, Imogen has a valid claim to at least part of the reward money, as the fairness of the agreement between Jack and Imogen was compromised by Jack's failure to disclose the reward.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case CACC457/2003, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the factor of **duty of disclosure** by the prosecution. This duty was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as ensuring fairness and transparency in legal proceedings, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it directly impacted the credibility of a key witness and the fairness of the trial. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of **duty of disclosure by a legal authority** is notably absent. The current case involves private individuals (Jack and Imogen) rather than a legal authority with a formal duty to disclose material information. Therefore, the same level of duty and the implications of non-disclosure do not apply in the same way.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor of **personal relationship and informal agreement** that was not present in CACC457/2003. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of non-disclosure. In the current case, the informal and personal nature of the agreement between Jack and Imogen introduces complexities related to personal trust and expectations, which were not present in the formal legal context of CACC457/2003. Due to this personal relationship and informal agreement, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as undermining personal trust and creating potential conflicts in personal relationships, than positive ones. Unlike in CACC457/2003, where the duty of disclosure was clear and formal, the informal nature of the agreement between Jack and Imogen makes the application of the same legal principles less straightforward and potentially more harmful to personal dynamics.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from CACC457/2003 should be stated as: "When both [i*] (non-disclosure of material information that could affect the fairness of an agreement or proceeding) and [m] (duty of disclosure by a legal authority) are present, the court should decide [o] (that such non-disclosure constitutes a material irregularity)." Omitting [m] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q] (undermining the formal duty of legal authorities to ensure fairness and transparency in legal proceedings). Indeed, the opinion in CACC457/2003 explicitly states that the duty of disclosure by the prosecution was crucial to their decision, as it directly impacted the credibility of a key witness and the fairness of the trial.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in CACC457/2003 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of undermining the formal duty of legal authorities to ensure fairness and transparency in legal proceedings. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence occurring because the situation involves private individuals (Jack and Imogen) rather than a legal authority with a formal duty to disclose material information. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The informal and personal nature of the agreement between Jack and Imogen introduces complexities related to personal trust and expectations, which were not present in the formal legal context of CACC457/2003. Thus, the rule from the precedent case should not apply to the current case.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the formal duty of disclosure by a legal authority, which was present in the precedent case CACC457/2003, requiring this factor for all similar cases of non-disclosure of material information that could affect the fairness of an agreement or proceeding would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would create a loophole where private individuals could exploit non-disclosure to their advantage, undermining the principles of fairness and transparency in personal agreements. Conversely, not requiring the formal duty of disclosure by a legal authority would allow for a more equitable distribution of benefits in personal agreements, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and justice in contract law. This approach ensures that all parties are treated fairly and that material information is disclosed, preventing unjust enrichment and promoting transparency.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the formal duty of disclosure by a legal authority, which was present in CACC457/2003, we have the additional factor of personal trust and informal agreement between Jack and Imogen. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of non-disclosure of material information, serves a similar function to the formal duty of disclosure in the precedent case. Given the presence of personal trust and informal agreement, we submit that the reasoning in CACC457/2003 still applies, as the positive effects on fairness and transparency in personal agreements would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. This ensures that Imogen is treated fairly and that Jack does not unjustly enrich himself at her expense, thereby upholding the principles of fairness and justice in contract law.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to CACC457/2003, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the non-disclosure of material information that could affect the fairness of an agreement or proceeding. However, it also differs significantly in that the precedent involved a formal duty of disclosure by a legal authority, whereas the current case involves private individuals and an informal agreement.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case, which emphasizes the duty of disclosure and the impact of non-disclosure on fairness, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in the context of personal relationships and informal agreements.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that non-disclosure in personal agreements can undermine fairness and transparency (Step 9) and the counterpoint that the formal duty of disclosure by a legal authority is a crucial factor in the precedent case (Step 7).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, transparency, and the prevention of unjust enrichment, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Imogen has a valid claim to at least part of the reward money. This decision aligns with the principles of fairness and justice in contract law, ensuring that Imogen is treated fairly and that Jack does not unjustly enrich himself at her expense.

Key factors that influenced this outcome include the importance of disclosing material information in any agreement, whether formal or informal, and the need to uphold fairness and transparency in personal dealings. Therefore, Imogen should be entitled to at least half of the reward money, if not all, given that she was the one who found the parrot and was unaware of the reward due to Jack's non-disclosure.

## Deductive Reasoning: ca

### Relevant law:

CACV 99/2010 Au Sou Lin v Zielona Transport Limited

### Major Premise:

1. CACV 99/2010 Au Sou Lin v Zielona Transport Limited

   Conditions:
   - The defendant has been enriched by the receipt of a benefit
   - This enrichment is at the expense of the claimant
   - The retention of the enrichment is unjust
   - There is no defence or bar to the claim

   Consequences:
   - The claimant may have a claim for unjust enrichment

   Exceptions:
   - There are reasons of policy for denying a remedy

### Minor Premise:

1. The defendant has been enriched by the receipt of a benefit:
   - Jack has received the benefit of the reward money by providing Imogen's address and arranging for the parrot's collection.

2. This enrichment is at the expense of the claimant:
   - Imogen found the parrot and provided the necessary information for its recovery, which led to the reward being claimed by Jack.

3. The retention of the enrichment is unjust:
   - Jack did not inform Imogen about the reward and claimed it for himself, despite Imogen being the one who found the parrot.

4. There is no defence or bar to the claim:
   - There is no indication of any defence or bar to Imogen's claim for the reward money.

### Conclusion:

Imogen may have a claim for unjust enrichment against Jack, as all conditions are satisfied and no exceptions apply.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (ZHANG JIZHI v. HONG KONG TV INTERNATIONAL MEDIA GROUP LTD AND ANOTHER)

In the case of ZHANG JIZHI v. HONG KONG TV INTERNATIONAL MEDIA GROUP LTD AND ANOTHER [2022] HKCFI 308; HCA 624/2019 (precedent p), the court ruled that the defendant (D1) was unjustly enriched by the sum received from the plaintiff (P) due to a total failure of consideration. The court found that the "true bargain" or "nub of the deal" under the Agreement was for P to become the owner of and acquire title to the Shares, which required registration of the Shares in P's name. Since this did not occur, the court concluded that there was an unjust element in P's payment, and D1's defences, including change of position, were not sufficient to counter the claim for unjust enrichment.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in ZHANG JIZHI v. HONG KONG TV INTERNATIONAL MEDIA GROUP LTD AND ANOTHER and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Unjust Enrichment**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In ZHANG JIZHI, D1 received a sum from P without fulfilling the contractual obligation to transfer shares. In the current case, Jack and Imogen are disputing the reward money for the recovery of the parrot, where Imogen found the parrot but was unaware of the reward, and Jack reported it to claim the reward.

- **Legal Concept 2: Total Failure of Consideration**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In ZHANG JIZHI, the court found a total failure of consideration as the shares were not registered in P's name. In the current case, Imogen's action of finding the parrot and Jack's action of reporting it can be seen as the basis for the reward, but the owners argue that Imogen did not know of the reward, thus questioning the consideration.

- **Legal Concept 3: Contractual Obligations and Promises**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In ZHANG JIZHI, the contractual promise was to transfer shares, which was not fulfilled. In the current case, the implied promise is the reward for the recovery of the parrot, which Imogen fulfilled by finding the parrot, and Jack attempted to fulfill by reporting it.

- **Legal Concept 4: Knowledge of Reward**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In ZHANG JIZHI, the knowledge of the contractual terms was crucial. In the current case, the knowledge of the reward is crucial to determine entitlement, as Imogen was unaware of the reward when she found the parrot.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (ZHANG JIZHI v. HONG KONG TV INTERNATIONAL MEDIA GROUP LTD AND ANOTHER)

This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern where a party has performed an action that fulfills the basis of a reward or consideration, but there is a dispute over the knowledge or fulfillment of the terms, the court should decide in favor of the party who performed the action if the unjust enrichment principle applies. This rule was justified in ZHANG JIZHI v. HONG KONG TV INTERNATIONAL MEDIA GROUP LTD AND ANOTHER because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that parties are not unjustly enriched by receiving benefits without fulfilling their obligations outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially allowing claims where the knowledge of the reward or terms was not explicit.

In the current case, applying this rule would mean that Imogen, who found the parrot, should be entitled to at least part of the reward, as her action directly led to the recovery of the parrot, fulfilling the basis of the reward. Jack's claim may be less strong as he did not perform the primary action of finding the parrot, but he did facilitate the reporting. Therefore, the court should consider the principle of unjust enrichment and the total failure of consideration to determine the fair distribution of the reward money.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (ZHANG JIZHI v. HONG KONG TV INTERNATIONAL MEDIA GROUP LTD AND ANOTHER) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Unjust Enrichment**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In ZHANG JIZHI, D1 received a sum from P without fulfilling the contractual obligation to transfer shares. In the current case, Jack and Imogen are disputing the reward money for the recovery of the parrot, where Imogen found the parrot but was unaware of the reward, and Jack reported it to claim the reward.

- **Legal Concept 2: Total Failure of Consideration**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In ZHANG JIZHI, the court found a total failure of consideration as the shares were not registered in P's name. In the current case, Imogen's action of finding the parrot and Jack's action of reporting it can be seen as the basis for the reward, but the owners argue that Imogen did not know of the reward, thus questioning the consideration.

- **Legal Concept 3: Contractual Obligations and Promises**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In ZHANG JIZHI, the contractual promise was to transfer shares, which was not fulfilled. In the current case, the implied promise is the reward for the recovery of the parrot, which Imogen fulfilled by finding the parrot, and Jack attempted to fulfill by reporting it.

- **Legal Concept 4: Knowledge of Reward**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In ZHANG JIZHI, the knowledge of the contractual terms was crucial. In the current case, the knowledge of the reward is crucial to determine entitlement, as Imogen was unaware of the reward when she found the parrot.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach a similar outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in ZHANG JIZHI v. HONG KONG TV INTERNATIONAL MEDIA GROUP LTD AND ANOTHER, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Fairness and Preventing Unjust Enrichment**: Imogen's action of finding the parrot directly led to its recovery, fulfilling the basis of the reward. Denying her any part of the reward would unjustly enrich the owners who benefit from her actions without compensating her.

2. **Encouraging Honesty and Good Faith**: By recognizing Imogen's contribution, the court would encourage individuals to act in good faith and report their findings, knowing they will be fairly compensated even if they were initially unaware of any reward.

3. **Clarifying Legal Obligations and Promises**: The court's decision would clarify that the fulfillment of the underlying action (finding the parrot) is crucial, regardless of the initial knowledge of the reward, thus reinforcing the importance of the actual performance over mere knowledge of terms.

4. **Promoting Legal Certainty and Reducing Disputes**: By upholding the principle that actions leading to the fulfillment of a reward should be compensated, the court would provide legal certainty, reducing future disputes over similar issues.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in ZHANG JIZHI v. HONG KONG TV INTERNATIONAL MEDIA GROUP LTD AND ANOTHER, it would have the positive effects of ensuring fairness, encouraging good faith, clarifying legal obligations, and promoting legal certainty.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **ZHANG JIZHI v. HONG KONG TV INTERNATIONAL MEDIA GROUP LTD AND ANOTHER**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the factor of **contractual obligations and promises**. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling (ensuring fairness and preventing unjust enrichment) outweighed any potential drawbacks (such as undermining contractual arrangements) because the court found that the defendant had failed to fulfill a clear contractual obligation to transfer shares, which was the basis of the plaintiff's payment.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of **contractual obligations and promises** is notably absent. Imogen and Jack did not have a contractual relationship with the parrot's owners regarding the reward. Imogen found the parrot without knowledge of the reward, and Jack reported it without any formal agreement with the owners. Therefore, the absence of a clear contractual obligation in the current case makes it less straightforward to apply the same principles of unjust enrichment and total failure of consideration as in the precedent case.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor **knowledge of the reward** that was not present in **ZHANG JIZHI v. HONG KONG TV INTERNATIONAL MEDIA GROUP LTD AND ANOTHER**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the knowledge of the reward is crucial in determining entitlement. In the precedent case, the parties were aware of their contractual obligations and the terms of the agreement. However, in the current case, Imogen was unaware of the reward when she found the parrot, which complicates the application of the same outcome.

Due to the factor of **knowledge of the reward**, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as discouraging individuals from reporting found items if they are unaware of potential rewards, unlike in **ZHANG JIZHI v. HONG KONG TV INTERNATIONAL MEDIA GROUP LTD AND ANOTHER**. The lack of initial knowledge of the reward by Imogen means that her actions were not motivated by the promise of a reward, which could be argued to undermine the basis for claiming it. Therefore, the presence of this factor significantly alters the balance of positive and negative effects, making it less appropriate to apply the same legal principles as in the precedent case.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **ZHANG JIZHI v. HONG KONG TV INTERNATIONAL MEDIA GROUP LTD AND ANOTHER** should be stated as "When both [i*] (the party has performed an action that fulfills the basis of a reward or consideration) and [m] (there is a clear contractual obligation or promise) are present, the court should decide [o] (in favor of the party who performed the action if the unjust enrichment principle applies)." Omitting [m] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q] (undermining the importance of contractual obligations and promises, leading to potential unfairness in cases where parties act without knowledge of rewards or terms). Indeed, the opinion in **ZHANG JIZHI v. HONG KONG TV INTERNATIONAL MEDIA GROUP LTD AND ANOTHER** explicitly states that [m] (the contractual obligation to transfer shares) was crucial to their decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **ZHANG JIZHI v. HONG KONG TV INTERNATIONAL MEDIA GROUP LTD AND ANOTHER** was clearly designed to prevent [undesirable consequence u] (parties being unjustly enriched by receiving benefits without fulfilling their contractual obligations). However, in our current case, there's no risk of [u] occurring because there is no clear contractual obligation or promise between Imogen, Jack, and the parrot's owners regarding the reward. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of a clear contractual obligation or promise (factor m), which was present in the precedent case **ZHANG JIZHI v. HONG KONG TV INTERNATIONAL MEDIA GROUP LTD AND ANOTHER**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of unjust enrichment would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would mean that individuals who perform actions leading to the fulfillment of a reward or benefit, but who were unaware of the reward or did not have a formal contract, would be unfairly denied compensation. Conversely, not requiring a clear contractual obligation would allow for a more equitable outcome, ensuring that individuals who contribute significantly to the fulfillment of a reward are compensated, even if they were initially unaware of the reward. This better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, which aim to prevent unjust enrichment and ensure fairness.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of a clear contractual obligation or promise (factor m), which was present in **ZHANG JIZHI v. HONG KONG TV INTERNATIONAL MEDIA GROUP LTD AND ANOTHER**, we have the additional factor of Imogen's direct action in finding the parrot (factor n). This factor n, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of unjust enrichment and total failure of consideration (i*), serves a similar function to the contractual obligation in the precedent case. Given the presence of n, we submit that the reasoning in **ZHANG JIZHI v. HONG KONG TV INTERNATIONAL MEDIA GROUP LTD AND ANOTHER** still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as fairness and preventing unjust enrichment would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **ZHANG JIZHI v. HONG KONG TV INTERNATIONAL MEDIA GROUP LTD AND ANOTHER**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the principles of unjust enrichment and total failure of consideration. However, it also differs significantly in the absence of a clear contractual obligation or promise and the factor of knowledge of the reward.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case, which emphasizes the importance of fulfilling contractual obligations to prevent unjust enrichment, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in scenarios where no formal contract exists, and the party performing the action is unaware of the reward.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that Imogen's direct action in finding the parrot (factor n) should be recognized and compensated to prevent unjust enrichment, even in the absence of a formal contract. Conversely, the argument that knowledge of the reward is crucial to determine entitlement also holds merit, as it ensures that parties are aware of the terms and conditions before claiming a reward.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, preventing unjust enrichment, and the importance of knowledge of terms, we conclude that Imogen should be entitled to a portion of the reward. This decision aligns with the principle of unjust enrichment, as her action directly led to the recovery of the parrot, fulfilling the basis of the reward. However, since she was unaware of the reward, it would be equitable to share the reward with Jack, who facilitated the reporting and collection of the parrot.

Therefore, we conclude that Imogen and Jack should share the reward money, with Imogen receiving a larger portion due to her direct action in finding the parrot. This decision balances the considerations of legal precedent, fairness, and the specific circumstances of the case, ensuring that both parties are fairly compensated for their contributions.


# Contract Law: Whether the principle of 'unjust enrichment' applies to Jack's claim for the reward

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Theft Ordinance Cap. 210 Section 25

### Major Premise:

1. Theft Ordinance Cap. 210 Section 25

   Conditions:
   - Any public advertisement of a reward for the return of any goods which have been stolen or lost
   - The advertisement uses any words to the effect that no questions will be asked, or that the person producing the goods will be safe from apprehension or inquiry, or that any money paid for the purchase of the goods or advanced by way of loan on them will be repaid

   Consequences:
   - The person advertising the reward and any person who prints or publishes the advertisement shall be guilty of an offence
   - Shall be liable on conviction to a fine at level 1

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Theft Ordinance Cap. 210 Section 25:
   - The owners of the Blue Parrot restaurant have publicly advertised a reward for the return of their lost parrot.
   - The advertisement does not use any words to the effect that no questions will be asked, or that the person producing the goods will be safe from apprehension or inquiry, or that any money paid for the purchase of the goods or advanced by way of loan on them will be repaid.
   - Therefore, the advertisement does not fall under the conditions that would make it an offence under the Theft Ordinance Cap. 210 Section 25.

### Conclusion:

Theft Ordinance Cap. 210 Section 25 does not apply, as the advertisement does not contain any words to the effect that no questions will be asked or that the person producing the goods will be safe from apprehension or inquiry.

### Analysis of Contract Law and Unjust Enrichment:

The legal issue here is whether the principle of 'unjust enrichment' applies to Jack's claim for the reward.

### Major Premise:

1. Contract Law Principles on Rewards:

   Conditions:
   - A reward is offered for the return of lost property.
   - The person claiming the reward must have knowledge of the reward at the time of performing the act that leads to the return of the property.
   - The person claiming the reward must perform the act with the intention of claiming the reward.

   Consequences:
   - The person who fulfills the conditions of the reward offer is entitled to the reward.

   Exceptions:
   - If the person did not know about the reward at the time of performing the act, they are not entitled to the reward.

### Minor Premise:

1. Contract Law Principles on Rewards:
   - The owners of the Blue Parrot restaurant offered a reward for the return of their lost parrot.
   - Imogen found the parrot but did not know about the reward at the time she found it.
   - Jack knew about the reward and reported the parrot's location to the owners with the intention of claiming the reward.
   - The owners refused to pay Jack as they felt he did nothing towards the recovery of the bird.
   - Imogen, who actually found the parrot, did not know about the reward at the time of finding it and thus did not perform the act with the intention of claiming the reward.

### Conclusion:

Based on the principles of contract law regarding rewards, neither Imogen nor Jack is entitled to the reward. Imogen did not know about the reward at the time she found the parrot, and Jack did not perform the act of finding the parrot. Therefore, the principle of 'unjust enrichment' does not apply to Jack's claim for the reward.

### Major Premise:

1. Shanghai Tongji Science & Technology Industrial Co Ltd v Casil Clearing Ltd (2004) 7 HKCFAR 79

   Conditions:
   - The defendant is enriched
   - The enrichment is at the plaintiff's expense
   - The enrichment is unjust
   - No applicable defenses are established

   Consequences:
   - The defendant is not entitled to retain the money

   Exceptions:
   - The defendant can establish a valid defense

### Minor Premise:

1. Shanghai Tongji Science & Technology Industrial Co Ltd v Casil Clearing Ltd (2004) 7 HKCFAR 79:
- Jack is the defendant who claims the reward money.
- The reward money would be an enrichment to Jack.
- The enrichment (reward money) is at the expense of the parrot's owners.
- The enrichment is unjust because Jack did not contribute to the recovery of the parrot; Imogen did.
- No applicable defenses are established by Jack.

### Conclusion:

Shanghai Tongji Science & Technology Industrial Co Ltd v Casil Clearing Ltd (2004) 7 HKCFAR 79 applies, and Jack is not entitled to retain the reward money. The parrot's owners are justified in refusing to pay Jack. Imogen, having found and reported the parrot, may have a stronger claim to the reward, but her lack of knowledge about the reward at the time of finding the parrot complicates her claim.


# Contract Law: Whether there is a contractual obligation for the restaurant owners to pay the reward to either Jack or Imogen


# Contract Law: Whether the reward offer can be considered a unilateral contract and if so, who fulfilled the conditions of the contract

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Theft Ordinance Cap. 210 Section 25

### Major Premise:

1. Theft Ordinance Cap. 210 Section 25

   Conditions:
   - Any public advertisement of a reward for the return of any goods which have been stolen or lost
   - The advertisement uses any words to the effect that no questions will be asked, or that the person producing the goods will be safe from apprehension or inquiry, or that any money paid for the purchase of the goods or advanced by way of loan on them will be repaid

   Consequences:
   - The person advertising the reward and any person who prints or publishes the advertisement shall be guilty of an offence
   - Shall be liable on conviction to a fine at level 1

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Theft Ordinance Cap. 210 Section 25:
- The owners of the Blue Parrot restaurant have publicly advertised a reward for the return of their lost parrot.
- The advertisement does not use any words to the effect that no questions will be asked, or that the person producing the goods will be safe from apprehension or inquiry, or that any money paid for the purchase of the goods or advanced by way of loan on them will be repaid.
- Therefore, the advertisement does not fall under the conditions that would make it an offence under Section 25 of the Theft Ordinance.

### Conclusion:

The advertisement for the reward does not violate the Theft Ordinance Cap. 210 Section 25, as it does not contain any words to the effect that no questions will be asked or that the person producing the goods will be safe from apprehension or inquiry.

### Legal Issue:

Whether the reward offer can be considered a unilateral contract and if so, who fulfilled the conditions of the contract.

### Analysis:

1. **Unilateral Contract**:
   - A unilateral contract is formed when one party makes a promise in exchange for the performance of an act by another party.
   - The offer of a reward for the return of the lost parrot constitutes a unilateral contract.

2. **Acceptance and Performance**:
   - Imogen found the parrot and kept it safe, which constitutes the performance required by the unilateral contract.
   - Jack reported the location of the parrot to the owners, but he did not perform the act of finding and securing the parrot.

3. **Entitlement to Reward**:
   - Imogen is the one who fulfilled the conditions of the unilateral contract by finding and securing the parrot.
   - The fact that Imogen was unaware of the reward at the time she found the parrot does not negate her entitlement to the reward, as the performance of the act (finding and securing the parrot) is what matters in a unilateral contract.

### Conclusion:

Imogen has a legal claim to the reward money offered by the owners of the Blue Parrot restaurant, as she fulfilled the conditions of the unilateral contract by finding and securing the parrot. Jack does not have a legal claim to the reward money, as he did not perform the act required by the unilateral contract.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HKSAR v So Kam Tim)

In the case of HKSAR v So Kam Tim (precedent p), the court dealt with the issue of whether the acceptance of a bribe or reward required the actual performance of the act for which the bribe was given. The court ruled that the offence of accepting or soliciting a bribe is complete at the moment the bribe is accepted or solicited, regardless of whether the act for which the bribe was given is actually performed. The court emphasized that the state of mind of the person accepting or soliciting the bribe is what matters, not the actual performance of the act.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in HKSAR v So Kam Tim and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Unilateral Contract**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the acceptance of a bribe was considered a unilateral contract where the acceptance of the bribe completed the contract, regardless of the performance of the act. In the current case, the reward offer for the recovery of the parrot is a unilateral contract where the performance of the act (recovering the parrot) completes the contract.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: State of Mind and Knowledge of the Offer**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the court focused on the state of mind of the person accepting the bribe. In the current case, the state of mind and knowledge of Imogen and Jack regarding the reward offer are crucial in determining their entitlement to the reward.
  
- **Legal Concept 3: Performance of the Act**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the actual performance of the act for which the bribe was given was deemed irrelevant. In the current case, the actual recovery of the parrot (performance of the act) is relevant to the completion of the unilateral contract.
  
- **Legal Concept 4: Entitlement to Reward**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the entitlement to the bribe was based on the acceptance of the bribe. In the current case, the entitlement to the reward is based on the performance of the act (recovering the parrot) and the knowledge of the reward offer.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HKSAR v So Kam Tim)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a unilateral contract involving a reward offer, the court should decide that the person who performs the act specified in the offer is entitled to the reward, provided they had knowledge of the offer. This rule was justified in HKSAR v So Kam Tim because the focus on the state of mind and the acceptance of the bribe ensured that the underlying values of deterring corruption and upholding the integrity of public servants were maintained. Similarly, in the current case, focusing on the performance of the act and the knowledge of the reward offer ensures that the principles of contract law and fairness are upheld.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HKSAR v So Kam Tim) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Unilateral Contract**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the acceptance of a bribe was considered a unilateral contract where the acceptance of the bribe completed the contract, regardless of the performance of the act. In the current case, the reward offer for the recovery of the parrot is a unilateral contract where the performance of the act (recovering the parrot) completes the contract.

- **Legal Concept 2: State of Mind and Knowledge of the Offer**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the court focused on the state of mind of the person accepting the bribe. In the current case, the state of mind and knowledge of Imogen and Jack regarding the reward offer are crucial in determining their entitlement to the reward.

- **Legal Concept 3: Performance of the Act**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the actual performance of the act for which the bribe was given was deemed irrelevant. In the current case, the actual recovery of the parrot (performance of the act) is relevant to the completion of the unilateral contract.

- **Legal Concept 4: Entitlement to Reward**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the entitlement to the bribe was based on the acceptance of the bribe. In the current case, the entitlement to the reward is based on the performance of the act (recovering the parrot) and the knowledge of the reward offer.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HKSAR v So Kam Tim, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding the Principles of Contract Law**: By recognizing the reward offer as a unilateral contract, the court would uphold the principles of contract law, ensuring that offers made to the public are enforceable when the specified conditions are met.

2. **Fairness and Equity**: The decision would ensure fairness by rewarding the person who performed the act specified in the offer, provided they had knowledge of the offer. This aligns with the principle that one should not benefit from another's ignorance of a reward.

3. **Encouraging Honesty and Transparency**: By focusing on the state of mind and knowledge of the reward offer, the court would encourage individuals to act honestly and transparently when claiming rewards, thereby promoting ethical behavior.

4. **Deterring Unjust Enrichment**: The decision would deter individuals from unjustly enriching themselves by claiming rewards without performing the specified act or without knowledge of the reward offer.

Therefore, based on the shared fact patterns and the positive effects on the underlying values and principles of the law, the court should find that Imogen, who found the parrot, is entitled to the reward, provided she had knowledge of the reward offer at the time of the recovery. Jack, who merely reported the find, would not be entitled to the reward as he did not perform the act specified in the offer.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the lack of knowledge of the reward offer by Imogen at the time she found the parrot, that was not present in HKSAR v So Kam Tim. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of a unilateral contract involving a reward offer. Because Imogen did not know about the reward when she found the parrot, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences than positive ones. Specifically, it would undermine the principle that a unilateral contract requires the offeree to have knowledge of the offer to accept it and claim the reward. This would lead to unjust enrichment and could encourage opportunistic behavior, unlike in HKSAR v So Kam Tim, where the focus was on the state of mind of the person accepting the bribe, ensuring the integrity of public servants. Therefore, the lack of knowledge of the reward offer by Imogen at the time she found the parrot is a crucial distinction that significantly impacts the application of the precedent to the current case.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from HKSAR v So Kam Tim should be stated as: "When both the shared fact pattern of a unilateral contract involving a reward offer and the knowledge of the reward offer by the offeree at the time of performing the act are present, the court should decide that the offeree is entitled to the reward." Omitting the knowledge of the reward offer from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of unjust enrichment and opportunistic behavior. Indeed, the opinion in HKSAR v So Kam Tim explicitly states that the state of mind of the person accepting the bribe was crucial to their decision, emphasizing the importance of the individual's knowledge and intent.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in HKSAR v So Kam Tim was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of public servants accepting bribes without the intent to perform the corrupt act, thereby maintaining the integrity of public service. However, in our current case, there's no risk of undermining public service integrity. Instead, the focus is on ensuring fairness in the context of a reward offer. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The primary concern in our case is to prevent unjust enrichment and ensure that the reward is given to someone who had knowledge of the offer and performed the act with the intent to claim the reward.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the knowledge of the reward offer by Imogen at the time she found the parrot, which was present in the precedent case HKSAR v So Kam Tim, requiring this factor for all similar cases of unilateral contracts involving reward offers would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would discourage individuals from performing acts that benefit others if they are unaware of potential rewards, thereby reducing the overall effectiveness of reward offers as a means to incentivize helpful behavior. Conversely, not requiring the knowledge of the reward offer would allow for a more equitable distribution of rewards based on the actual performance of the act, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and incentivizing beneficial actions.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the knowledge of the reward offer by Imogen at the time she found the parrot, which was present in HKSAR v So Kam Tim, we have the additional factor of Jack's knowledge and subsequent actions. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of a unilateral contract involving a reward offer, serves a similar function to the knowledge of the reward offer in the precedent case. Given the presence of Jack's knowledge and actions, we submit that the reasoning in HKSAR v So Kam Tim still applies, as the positive effects on fairness and incentivizing beneficial actions would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. Jack's knowledge and actions effectively bridge the gap, ensuring that the reward is claimed by someone who was aware of the offer and took steps to fulfill its conditions.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the concept of a unilateral contract and the importance of the state of mind and knowledge of the offer. However, it also differs significantly in that Imogen did not have knowledge of the reward offer at the time she found the parrot, which is a crucial element in determining entitlement to the reward.

The proposed legal rule that "when both the shared fact pattern of a unilateral contract involving a reward offer and the knowledge of the reward offer by the offeree at the time of performing the act are present, the court should decide that the offeree is entitled to the reward" finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, particularly the need to prevent unjust enrichment and ensure fairness in the context of reward offers.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the knowledge of the reward offer is essential for a unilateral contract to be completed (as argued in the rebuttal) and the counterargument that Jack's knowledge and actions could bridge the gap (as argued in the surrebuttal).

Considering the underlying legal principles of contract law, fairness, and the prevention of unjust enrichment, we conclude that Imogen is not entitled to the reward because she did not have knowledge of the reward offer at the time she found the parrot. Jack, who had knowledge of the reward and took steps to fulfill its conditions, may have a stronger claim, but his actions alone do not fulfill the requirement of actually recovering the parrot.

Therefore, the final decision is that neither Imogen nor Jack is entitled to the reward money offered by the parrot's owners. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by ensuring that reward offers are only enforceable when the offeree has knowledge of the offer and performs the specified act with the intent to claim the reward.


# Contract Law: Whether the posters put up by the restaurant owners constitute a binding offer to the public

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Theft Ordinance Cap. 210 Section 25

### Major Premise:

1. Theft Ordinance Cap. 210 Section 25

   Conditions:
   - Any public advertisement of a reward for the return of any goods which have been stolen or lost
   - The advertisement uses any words to the effect that no questions will be asked, or that the person producing the goods will be safe from apprehension or inquiry, or that any money paid for the purchase of the goods or advanced by way of loan on them will be repaid

   Consequences:
   - The person advertising the reward and any person who prints or publishes the advertisement shall be guilty of an offence
   - Shall be liable on conviction to a fine at level 1

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Theft Ordinance Cap. 210 Section 25:
- The restaurant owners have put up posters offering a reward for the return of their lost parrot.
- The posters do not use any words to the effect that no questions will be asked, or that the person producing the goods will be safe from apprehension or inquiry, or that any money paid for the purchase of the goods or advanced by way of loan on them will be repaid.
- Therefore, the conditions of the Theft Ordinance Cap. 210 Section 25 are not satisfied.

### Conclusion:

Theft Ordinance Cap. 210 Section 25 does not apply as the posters do not contain any words to the effect that no questions will be asked or that the person producing the goods will be safe from apprehension or inquiry.

### Relevant law:

Contract Law principles on offers and acceptance

### Major Premise:

1. Contract Law principles on offers and acceptance

   Conditions:
   - An offer is made to the public
   - The offer is accepted by performing the requested act
   - The person performing the act has knowledge of the offer

   Consequences:
   - The person performing the act is entitled to the reward

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Contract Law principles on offers and acceptance:
- The restaurant owners made an offer to the public by putting up posters offering a reward for the return of their lost parrot.
- Imogen found the parrot and kept it in her greenhouse but did not know of the reward at the time.
- Jack, knowing of the reward, reported the parrot's location to the restaurant owners.
- Imogen later saw the poster and became aware of the reward.

### Conclusion:

Imogen did not have knowledge of the reward when she found the parrot, so she cannot claim the reward based on the principles of contract law. Jack, however, knew of the reward and performed the requested act by reporting the parrot's location. Therefore, Jack has a legal claim to the reward money offered by the restaurant owners.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited)
In the case of HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited (precedent p), the court ruled that the offence in question was a strict liability offence, meaning that proof of mens rea (intention or knowledge of wrongdoing) was not necessary. The court emphasized the importance of the statutory language, the nature and subject-matter of the offence, and the legislative purpose in determining whether the presumption of mens rea had been displaced.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Offer to the Public**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited, the court considered whether the statutory language and legislative intent indicated an offer to the public that did not require proof of mens rea. In our current case, the posters put up by the restaurant owners constitute an offer to the public for a reward.
- **Legal Concept 2: Acceptance of Offer**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** In HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited, the court examined the nature of the offence and the actions required to fulfill the statutory requirements. In our current case, the actions of Jack in reporting the parrot and providing the necessary information to the restaurant owners can be seen as an acceptance of the offer.
- **Legal Concept 3: Legislative Intent and Purpose**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited, the court focused on the legislative intent and purpose behind the statutory provisions. In our current case, the intent behind the reward offer is to incentivize the public to provide information leading to the recovery of the parrot.
- **Legal Concept 4: Strict Liability and Public Policy**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** In HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited, the court ruled that the offence was one of strict liability to ensure compliance with the legislative purpose. In our current case, the reward offer can be seen as a strict liability contract where the performance of the act (providing information leading to the recovery of the parrot) entitles the performer to the reward, regardless of their knowledge of the reward at the time of the act.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of an offer to the public (i*), the court should decide that the performance of the act specified in the offer entitles the performer to the reward (outcome o). This rule was justified in HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring compliance with the legislative purpose and incentivizing the desired behavior outweigh the negative effects (E-) of not requiring proof of mens rea.

Applying this rule to our current case, both Jack and Imogen have a legal claim to the reward money offered by the restaurant owners. Jack performed the act specified in the offer by providing the necessary information leading to the recovery of the parrot, and Imogen, although unaware of the reward at the time, was the one who found and secured the parrot. Therefore, both parties contributed to the fulfillment of the offer's conditions and should be entitled to the reward.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Offer to the Public**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** The posters put up by the restaurant owners constitute an offer to the public for a reward of £1,000 for information leading to the recovery of the parrot. This is similar to the statutory language in the precedent case, which constituted an offer to the public.

- **Legal Concept 2: Acceptance of Offer**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** Jack, by providing Imogen’s address and arranging for the collection of the parrot, performed the act specified in the offer, thereby accepting the offer. This mirrors the actions required to fulfill the statutory requirements in the precedent case.

- **Legal Concept 3: Legislative Intent and Purpose**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** The intent behind the reward offer is to incentivize the public to provide information leading to the recovery of the parrot. This is akin to the legislative purpose in the precedent case, which aimed to ensure compliance with the statutory provisions.

- **Legal Concept 4: Strict Liability and Public Policy**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** The reward offer can be seen as a strict liability contract where the performance of the act (providing information leading to the recovery of the parrot) entitles the performer to the reward, regardless of their knowledge of the reward at the time of the act. This is similar to the strict liability offence in the precedent case, which did not require proof of mens rea to ensure compliance with the legislative purpose.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Compliance with the Offer's Purpose:** The reward offer was made to incentivize the recovery of the parrot. Both Jack and Imogen contributed to this goal—Imogen by finding and securing the parrot, and Jack by reporting it and facilitating its return. Recognizing their claims to the reward ensures that the offer's purpose is fulfilled.

2. **Incentivizing Desired Behavior:** By upholding the reward offer, the court would encourage the public to act in similar situations, knowing that their efforts will be rewarded even if they were initially unaware of the reward. This aligns with the public policy goal of incentivizing the desired behavior.

3. **Fairness and Equity:** Both Jack and Imogen played significant roles in the recovery of the parrot. Denying them the reward would be unjust, especially since their actions directly led to the fulfillment of the offer's conditions. This promotes fairness and equity in contractual dealings.

4. **Clarity in Public Offers:** Upholding the reward offer clarifies that public offers are binding and enforceable, providing certainty and predictability in contractual relationships. This is crucial for maintaining trust in public offers and ensuring that they are taken seriously.

Therefore, both Jack and Imogen have a legal claim to the reward money offered by the restaurant owners. Jack's actions in reporting the parrot and providing the necessary information, combined with Imogen's role in finding and securing the parrot, entitle them to the reward as per the terms of the offer.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the concept of strict liability. The strict liability nature of the offence was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as ensuring compliance with the legislative purpose and incentivizing the desired behavior, outweighed any potential drawbacks, such as not requiring proof of mens rea. However, in our current case, this crucial concept of strict liability is notably absent as the issue revolves around contract law and the acceptance of an offer, rather than a statutory offence where strict liability is a consideration.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the knowledge of the reward, that was not present in HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the knowledge of the reward is crucial in determining whether there was a valid acceptance of the offer. Due to the presence of this factor, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as undermining the principle that acceptance of an offer must be made with knowledge of the offer, than positive ones, unlike in HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited. This is because, in contract law, for a reward to be claimed, the claimant must have knowledge of the offer and act in reliance on it, which was not a consideration in the precedent case.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited should be stated as "When both the fact pattern of an offer to the public (i*) and the knowledge of the reward (m) are present, the court should decide that the performance of the act specified in the offer entitles the performer to the reward (outcome o)." Omitting the knowledge of the reward (m) from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of undermining the principle that acceptance of an offer must be made with knowledge of the offer. Indeed, the opinion in HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited did not explicitly address the issue of knowledge of the offer, as it was not relevant to the statutory offence in question. However, in contract law, the knowledge of the reward is crucial to ensure that the acceptance of the offer is valid and intentional.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of non-compliance with statutory provisions by ensuring that strict liability offences do not require proof of mens rea. However, in our current case, there's no risk of non-compliance with statutory provisions, as the issue revolves around the acceptance of a reward offer in contract law. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The focus in our case should be on whether the acceptance of the reward offer was made with knowledge of the offer, which is a fundamental principle in contract law.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the knowledge of the reward (factor m), which was present in the precedent case HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited, requiring this factor for all similar cases of an offer to the public (fact pattern i*) would lead to the undesirable consequence of undermining the principle of fairness and equity in contractual dealings. Conversely, not requiring the knowledge of the reward would allow for the desirable outcome of ensuring that individuals who contribute to the fulfillment of an offer's conditions are fairly compensated, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, such as incentivizing desired behavior and ensuring compliance with the offer's purpose.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the knowledge of the reward (factor m), which was present in HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited, we have the additional factor of the actual performance of the act specified in the offer (factor n). This factor n, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of an offer to the public (fact pattern i*), serves a similar function to the knowledge of the reward in the precedent case. Given the presence of the actual performance of the act, we submit that the reasoning in HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited still applies, as the positive effects on legal values, such as ensuring compliance with the offer's purpose and incentivizing desired behavior, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HKSAR v Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the concept of an offer to the public and the performance of an act specified in the offer. However, it also differs significantly in that the precedent case involved a strict liability offence under statutory law, whereas the current case revolves around contract law and the acceptance of a reward offer.

The proposed legal rule of "When both the fact pattern of an offer to the public and the knowledge of the reward are present, the court should decide that the performance of the act specified in the offer entitles the performer to the reward" finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of knowledge of the reward in contract law (a strong point from the rebuttal) and the actual performance of the act specified in the offer (a strong point from the surrebuttal).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, equity, and incentivizing desired behavior, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that both Jack and Imogen have a legal claim to the reward money offered by the restaurant owners. This decision aligns with the principle that the performance of the act specified in the offer entitles the performer to the reward, even if the performer was initially unaware of the reward, as long as the act was performed in good faith and directly led to the fulfillment of the offer's conditions.

Key factors that influenced this outcome include:
1. **Performance of the Act:** Both Jack and Imogen contributed to the recovery of the parrot, fulfilling the conditions of the offer.
2. **Fairness and Equity:** Denying the reward to Jack and Imogen would be unjust, given their significant roles in the recovery of the parrot.
3. **Incentivizing Desired Behavior:** Upholding the reward offer encourages the public to act in similar situations, knowing that their efforts will be rewarded.

Therefore, both Jack and Imogen should be entitled to the reward money, with the exact division of the reward to be determined based on their respective contributions to the recovery of the parrot.


# Contract Law: Whether Imogen's subsequent knowledge of the reward after finding the parrot affects her claim to the reward

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (BARCO INVESTMENTS LTD v. WONG YAN HO)
In the case of BARCO INVESTMENTS LTD v. WONG YAN HO (ALSO KNOWN AS GEOFFREY WONG YAN HO) AND OTHERS [2023] HKCFI 1648; HCA 1184/2022 (23 June 2023) (precedent p), the court ruled that summary judgment or interim payment should not be granted against D6 to D8 for the entire claim made by P. The court found that the Finders’ Fees Defence was not incapable of being believed and bound to fail, and that the allegations of fraud and breach of fiduciary duties required a full trial to explore the facts. However, the court did grant summary judgment against D6 to D8 in respect of the traceable proceeds of the Investment Sum which were in their possession or control on 21 August 2022 or at any time thereafter, based on the proprietary claims pleaded by P.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in BARCO INVESTMENTS LTD v. WONG YAN HO and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Knowledge of Reward/Benefit**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In BARCO, D6 to D8 were not aware of the fictitious nature of the StockX Investment Opportunity at the time of their receipt of traceable proceeds but were later fixed with knowledge of the fraud. In the current case, Imogen was not aware of the reward when she found the parrot but later became aware of it.
- **Legal Concept 2: Entitlement to Reward/Benefit**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In BARCO, the court ruled that D6 to D8 could not rely on the misrepresentation of the share price to obtain a summary judgment on the whole Investment Sum. In the current case, the owners argue that Imogen cannot be entitled to the reward as she did not know of it when she found the parrot.
- **Legal Concept 3: Constructive Trust**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In BARCO, the court held that the Investment Sum and its traceable proceeds should be treated as being held on constructive trust for P. In the current case, the reward money could be seen as a benefit that should be held in trust for the person who found the parrot.
- **Legal Concept 4: Bona Fide Purchase**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In BARCO, the court discussed the bona fide purchase defence and found it not applicable. In the current case, Jack's actions could be scrutinized to determine if he acted in good faith and whether he is entitled to the reward.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (BARCO INVESTMENTS LTD v. WONG YAN HO)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a party becoming aware of a reward or benefit after performing the act that entitles them to the reward, the court should decide that the party is entitled to the reward if they can demonstrate that they acted in good faith and without prior knowledge of the reward. This rule was justified in BARCO INVESTMENTS LTD v. WONG YAN HO because the court found that the positive effects of ensuring that parties who act in good faith and without prior knowledge of a benefit are entitled to that benefit outweigh the negative effects of denying them the reward. This promotes fairness and encourages individuals to act in good faith, knowing that they will not be penalized for their lack of initial knowledge.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (BARCO INVESTMENTS LTD v. WONG YAN HO) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Knowledge of Reward/Benefit**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In BARCO, D6 to D8 were not aware of the fictitious nature of the StockX Investment Opportunity at the time of their receipt of traceable proceeds but were later fixed with knowledge of the fraud. In the current case, Imogen was not aware of the reward when she found the parrot but later became aware of it.

- **Legal Concept 2: Entitlement to Reward/Benefit**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In BARCO, the court ruled that D6 to D8 could not rely on the misrepresentation of the share price to obtain a summary judgment on the whole Investment Sum. In the current case, the owners argue that Imogen cannot be entitled to the reward as she did not know of it when she found the parrot.

- **Legal Concept 3: Constructive Trust**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In BARCO, the court held that the Investment Sum and its traceable proceeds should be treated as being held on constructive trust for P. In the current case, the reward money could be seen as a benefit that should be held in trust for the person who found the parrot.

- **Legal Concept 4: Bona Fide Purchase**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In BARCO, the court discussed the bona fide purchase defence and found it not applicable. In the current case, Jack's actions could be scrutinized to determine if he acted in good faith and whether he is entitled to the reward.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach a similar outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in BARCO INVESTMENTS LTD v. WONG YAN HO, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Encouraging Good Faith Actions**: Just as in BARCO, where the court recognized the importance of good faith actions, recognizing Imogen's claim to the reward would encourage individuals to act in good faith, knowing that they will not be penalized for their lack of initial knowledge of a reward.

2. **Fairness and Equity**: The court in BARCO emphasized fairness by ensuring that parties who acted without knowledge of the fraud were not unduly penalized. Similarly, it would be fair to reward Imogen for her actions in finding and reporting the parrot, even though she was initially unaware of the reward.

3. **Promoting Honesty and Transparency**: By ruling in favor of Imogen, the court would promote honesty and transparency. Jack's failure to inform Imogen about the reward could be seen as an attempt to unjustly enrich himself, which the court should discourage.

4. **Constructive Trust Principles**: Applying the principles of constructive trust, as seen in BARCO, the reward money should be held in trust for Imogen, who is the rightful beneficiary of the reward for finding the parrot.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in BARCO INVESTMENTS LTD v. WONG YAN HO, it would have the positive effects of promoting fairness, encouraging good faith actions, and upholding the principles of constructive trust.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor of **Imogen's lack of initial knowledge of the reward** that was not present in **BARCO INVESTMENTS LTD v. WONG YAN HO**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of **entitlement to reward/benefit** because Imogen's actions were not influenced by the reward offer, unlike the defendants in BARCO who were aware of the fraudulent nature of the investment at a later stage. Due to Imogen's lack of initial knowledge, applying the same outcome (entitlement to the reward) in our case would have more negative consequences such as **discouraging individuals from acting altruistically without the expectation of a reward** than positive ones, unlike in **BARCO INVESTMENTS LTD v. WONG YAN HO** because in BARCO, the defendants' later knowledge of the fraud did not negate their initial actions which were based on misrepresentation.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **BARCO INVESTMENTS LTD v. WONG YAN HO** should be stated as "When both [i*] (knowledge of reward/benefit) and [m] (subsequent knowledge of the reward after performing the act) are present, the court should decide [o] (entitlement to the reward)." Omitting [m] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q] (discouraging individuals from acting altruistically without the expectation of a reward). Indeed, the opinion in **BARCO INVESTMENTS LTD v. WONG YAN HO** explicitly states that the defendants' later knowledge of the fraud did not negate their initial actions which were based on misrepresentation, highlighting the relevance of subsequent knowledge to their decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **BARCO INVESTMENTS LTD v. WONG YAN HO** was clearly designed to prevent [undesirable consequence u] (unjust enrichment of parties who acted in bad faith or with prior knowledge of a fraudulent scheme). However, in our current case, there's no risk of [u] occurring because Imogen acted without any knowledge of the reward when she found the parrot. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Imogen's lack of initial knowledge and her subsequent discovery of the reward should not disqualify her from claiming it, as her actions were in good faith and without any expectation of a reward.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of subsequent knowledge of the reward after performing the act (m), which was present in the precedent case BARCO INVESTMENTS LTD v. WONG YAN HO, requiring this factor for all similar cases of entitlement to reward/benefit (i*) would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would discourage individuals from acting altruistically without the expectation of a reward. Conversely, not requiring subsequent knowledge of the reward would allow for a desirable outcome, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area. The law aims to promote fairness and encourage good faith actions. By not requiring subsequent knowledge of the reward, the law would ensure that individuals who act in good faith and without prior knowledge of a reward are still entitled to it, thereby promoting honesty and transparency.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of subsequent knowledge of the reward after performing the act (m), which was present in BARCO INVESTMENTS LTD v. WONG YAN HO, we have the additional factor of Imogen's initial good faith action (n). This factor of initial good faith action, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of entitlement to reward/benefit (i*), serves a similar function to subsequent knowledge of the reward in the precedent case. Given the presence of initial good faith action, we submit that the reasoning in BARCO INVESTMENTS LTD v. WONG YAN HO still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as promoting fairness and encouraging good faith actions, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **BARCO INVESTMENTS LTD v. WONG YAN HO**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in the legal concepts of knowledge of reward/benefit, entitlement to reward/benefit, and constructive trust. However, it also differs significantly in the factor of Imogen's initial lack of knowledge of the reward when she found the parrot.

The proposed legal rule from **BARCO INVESTMENTS LTD v. WONG YAN HO** suggests that subsequent knowledge of a reward after performing the act entitles the party to the reward if they acted in good faith. This rule finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered, especially in terms of promoting fairness and encouraging good faith actions.

We've weighed arguments from both sides. A strong point from the initial analogy is that recognizing Imogen's claim to the reward would encourage individuals to act in good faith, knowing they will not be penalized for their lack of initial knowledge of a reward. Conversely, a strong point from the rebuttal is that requiring subsequent knowledge of the reward could discourage individuals from acting altruistically without the expectation of a reward.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, good faith, and the promotion of honesty and transparency, we conclude that Imogen should be entitled to the reward. This decision aligns with the precedent set in **BARCO INVESTMENTS LTD v. WONG YAN HO** by promoting fairness and encouraging good faith actions, even though Imogen did not initially know about the reward. The key factors influencing this outcome are Imogen's good faith action in finding and reporting the parrot and the principle that individuals should not be penalized for their lack of initial knowledge of a reward.

Therefore, Imogen has a valid legal claim to the reward money offered, and Jack's actions, while helpful, do not entitle him to the reward as he did not find the parrot. The owners' argument that Imogen cannot be entitled to the reward because she did not know of it when she found the parrot is not supported by the principles of fairness and good faith.


# Contract Law: Whether Jack's failure to inform Imogen about the reward affects his entitlement to the reward

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (MOMIN LOK v. HOSPITAL AUTHORITY)
In the case of MOMIN LOK v. HOSPITAL AUTHORITY (precedent p), the court dealt with the issue of knowledge and the timing of when a plaintiff's knowledge of an injury and its cause starts the limitation period for bringing a claim. The court ruled that knowledge for the purpose of the limitation period includes both actual and constructive knowledge, and that the plaintiff must have sufficient knowledge to justify embarking on the preliminaries to litigation. The court emphasized that the plaintiff does not need to have full knowledge of all the details but must have a reasonable belief that the injury is attributable to the defendant's act or omission.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in MOMIN LOK v. HOSPITAL AUTHORITY and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Knowledge and Awareness of a Reward**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In MOMIN LOK, the court considered when the plaintiff had sufficient knowledge to start the limitation period. In our current case, the issue is whether Imogen's lack of knowledge about the reward affects her entitlement to it.
- **Legal Concept 2: Reasonable Belief and Actions Taken**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In MOMIN LOK, the court ruled that the plaintiff must have a reasonable belief that the injury is attributable to the defendant's act or omission. In our current case, Jack acted on the belief that reporting the parrot would entitle him to the reward, while Imogen was unaware of the reward.
- **Legal Concept 3: Constructive Knowledge**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In MOMIN LOK, the court considered constructive knowledge, which includes knowledge that a person might reasonably have been expected to acquire. In our current case, the question is whether Imogen should have been aware of the reward through the posters.
- **Legal Concept 4: Equitable Considerations**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In MOMIN LOK, the court had to balance the equities between the plaintiff and the defendant. In our current case, the equitable consideration is whether it is fair for Jack to claim the entire reward when Imogen found the parrot.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (MOMIN LOK v. HOSPITAL AUTHORITY)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern where a person has taken actions based on a reasonable belief and has constructive knowledge of a reward, the court should decide that the person is entitled to the reward. This rule was justified in MOMIN LOK v. HOSPITAL AUTHORITY because the court recognized that a plaintiff does not need full knowledge of all details but must have a reasonable belief to justify their actions. The positive effects (E+) of this outcome include promoting fairness and encouraging individuals to act on reasonable beliefs, while the negative effects (E-) are minimal as it does not require absolute certainty or full knowledge. 

In our current case, Jack had a reasonable belief that reporting the parrot would entitle him to the reward, and Imogen, through constructive knowledge, could have been aware of the reward through the posters. Therefore, applying the rule from MOMIN LOK, Jack should be entitled to the reward, but equitable considerations suggest that Imogen should also receive a share of the reward for her role in finding the parrot.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (MOMIN LOK v. HOSPITAL AUTHORITY) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Knowledge and Awareness of a Reward**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In MOMIN LOK, the court considered when the plaintiff had sufficient knowledge to start the limitation period. In our current case, the issue is whether Imogen's lack of knowledge about the reward affects her entitlement to it.

- **Legal Concept 2: Reasonable Belief and Actions Taken**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In MOMIN LOK, the court ruled that the plaintiff must have a reasonable belief that the injury is attributable to the defendant's act or omission. In our current case, Jack acted on the belief that reporting the parrot would entitle him to the reward, while Imogen was unaware of the reward.

- **Legal Concept 3: Constructive Knowledge**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In MOMIN LOK, the court considered constructive knowledge, which includes knowledge that a person might reasonably have been expected to acquire. In our current case, the question is whether Imogen should have been aware of the reward through the posters.

- **Legal Concept 4: Equitable Considerations**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In MOMIN LOK, the court had to balance the equities between the plaintiff and the defendant. In our current case, the equitable consideration is whether it is fair for Jack to claim the entire reward when Imogen found the parrot.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach a similar outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in MOMIN LOK v. HOSPITAL AUTHORITY, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Promoting Fairness**: Just as the court in MOMIN LOK balanced the equities between the parties, awarding the reward to both Jack and Imogen would ensure that both parties are fairly compensated for their contributions. Jack took the initiative to report the parrot, while Imogen found and secured the parrot.

2. **Encouraging Reasonable Actions**: By recognizing Jack's reasonable belief and actions, the court would encourage individuals to act on reasonable beliefs, knowing that their efforts will be acknowledged and rewarded.

3. **Constructive Knowledge**: Imogen, through constructive knowledge, could have been aware of the reward through the posters. This aligns with the principle that individuals should be aware of publicly available information that could affect their legal rights.

4. **Equitable Distribution**: The court should consider an equitable distribution of the reward. While Jack's actions were crucial in reporting the parrot, Imogen's role in finding and securing the parrot was equally important. Therefore, a fair distribution of the reward would be in line with equitable principles.

In conclusion, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach a similar outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in MOMIN LOK v. HOSPITAL AUTHORITY, it would promote fairness, encourage reasonable actions, recognize constructive knowledge, and ensure an equitable distribution of the reward.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case MOMIN LOK v. HOSPITAL AUTHORITY, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the concept of "constructive knowledge." Constructive knowledge was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as promoting fairness and encouraging reasonable actions, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it allowed the court to consider what the plaintiff might reasonably have been expected to know, even if they did not have actual knowledge. However, in our current case, this crucial concept of "constructive knowledge" is notably absent as Imogen did not have any awareness of the reward until after the parrot was reported. She did not see the posters or have any other means of knowing about the reward before Jack reported the parrot.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor of "equitable considerations" that was not present in MOMIN LOK v. HOSPITAL AUTHORITY. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because, in our case, the equitable distribution of the reward is a key issue. Due to the equitable considerations, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as unfairly rewarding Jack for actions that were significantly dependent on Imogen's initial discovery of the parrot. Unlike in MOMIN LOK v. HOSPITAL AUTHORITY, where the focus was on the plaintiff's knowledge and the timing of the limitation period, our case requires a balance of contributions between Jack and Imogen to ensure fairness. Therefore, the presence of equitable considerations in our case suggests that both Jack and Imogen should share the reward, reflecting their respective roles in the recovery of the parrot.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from MOMIN LOK v. HOSPITAL AUTHORITY should be stated as: "When both [knowledge and awareness of a reward] and [equitable considerations] are present, the court should decide [to distribute the reward equitably between the parties involved]." Omitting [equitable considerations] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of unfairly rewarding one party over another, despite both parties contributing to the outcome]. Indeed, the opinion in MOMIN LOK v. HOSPITAL AUTHORITY explicitly states that equitable considerations were crucial to their decision, as the court had to balance the equities between the plaintiff and the defendant.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in MOMIN LOK v. HOSPITAL AUTHORITY was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of unfairly penalizing a plaintiff who had sufficient knowledge to justify their actions but did not have full knowledge of all details. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence occurring. Instead, the risk is that one party (Jack) might unfairly claim the entire reward despite the significant contribution of another party (Imogen) who found and secured the parrot. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule without considering equitable distribution here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—to ensure fairness based on knowledge and actions—does not fully address the equitable considerations relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction

While it's true that our case lacks the factor of "constructive knowledge," which was present in the precedent case MOMIN LOK v. HOSPITAL AUTHORITY, requiring this factor for all similar cases of knowledge and awareness of a reward would lead to the undesirable consequence of unfairly excluding individuals who have made significant contributions to an outcome but were not aware of specific details such as a reward. Conversely, not requiring "constructive knowledge" would allow for a more equitable distribution of rewards based on the actual contributions of the parties involved, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and equity in contract law. This approach ensures that individuals are not penalized for their lack of awareness of specific details when they have otherwise acted reasonably and contributed significantly to the desired outcome.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution

Although our case lacks the factor of "constructive knowledge," which was present in MOMIN LOK v. HOSPITAL AUTHORITY, we have the additional factor of "equitable considerations." This "equitable considerations," when considered alongside the shared circumstances of knowledge and awareness of a reward, serves a similar function to "constructive knowledge" in the precedent case. Given the presence of "equitable considerations," we submit that the reasoning in MOMIN LOK v. HOSPITAL AUTHORITY still applies, as the positive effects on fairness and equity would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. This ensures that both Jack and Imogen are fairly compensated for their respective contributions to the recovery of the parrot, promoting a just and balanced outcome.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to MOMIN LOK v. HOSPITAL AUTHORITY, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in terms of the legal concepts of knowledge and awareness, reasonable belief and actions taken, and constructive knowledge. However, it also differs significantly in the presence of equitable considerations, which were not a primary focus in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule from MOMIN LOK v. HOSPITAL AUTHORITY, which emphasizes the importance of knowledge (both actual and constructive) and reasonable belief, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the equitable considerations present in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that Jack had a reasonable belief and acted on it, and the counterpoint that Imogen, despite her lack of knowledge about the reward, played a crucial role in the recovery of the parrot and should be fairly compensated.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, equity, and the encouragement of reasonable actions, we conclude that both Jack and Imogen should share the reward. This decision aligns with the legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency. It ensures that both parties are fairly compensated for their respective contributions to the recovery of the parrot, promoting a just and balanced outcome.

Therefore, the reward should be equitably distributed between Jack and Imogen, reflecting their respective roles in the recovery of the parrot. This approach not only adheres to the principles established in MOMIN LOK v. HOSPITAL AUTHORITY but also addresses the unique equitable considerations present in this case.


# Contract Law: Whether the restaurant owners' statement that Imogen did not know of the reward affects her legal claim

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HKSAR v So Kam Tim)

In the case of HKSAR v So Kam Tim (precedent p), the court dealt with the issue of whether the state of mind of the person offering or accepting a reward or advantage was relevant to the commission of an offence under the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance. The court ruled that the state of mind of the person offering the reward was crucial, and it was not necessary to prove that the offeree had actually performed the act for which the reward was offered. The court emphasized that the offering of a reward itself constituted the offence, regardless of whether the act was performed.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in HKSAR v So Kam Tim and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Offer and Acceptance of Reward**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the court considered the offering of a reward as the central issue, regardless of whether the act was performed. Similarly, in our current case, the restaurant owners offered a reward for the recovery of the parrot, and the issue is whether Imogen or Jack can claim it.

- **Legal Concept 2: State of Mind and Knowledge of Reward**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the court focused on the state of mind of the person offering the reward. In our current case, the state of mind and knowledge of Imogen and Jack regarding the reward are crucial in determining their entitlement.

- **Legal Concept 3: Performance of the Act**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, it was established that the performance of the act for which the reward was offered was not necessary to establish the offence. In our current case, the performance of the act (reporting the parrot) by Jack and Imogen is under scrutiny to determine entitlement to the reward.

- **Legal Concept 4: Legal Entitlement to Reward**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the court ruled that the offering of a reward itself was sufficient to constitute the offence. In our current case, the legal entitlement to the reward is questioned based on the actions and knowledge of Imogen and Jack.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HKSAR v So Kam Tim)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of an offer of a reward and the state of mind of the parties involved, the court should decide based on the knowledge and actions of the parties regarding the reward. This rule was justified in HKSAR v So Kam Tim because the court emphasized the importance of the state of mind and the offering of the reward itself, rather than the performance of the act, in determining the outcome. The positive effects (E+) of this outcome on the underlying values and principles of the law, such as fairness and the prevention of unjust enrichment, outweigh the negative effects (E-) in that case. Therefore, in our current case, the court should consider the knowledge and actions of Imogen and Jack regarding the reward to determine their legal entitlement.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HKSAR v So Kam Tim) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Offer and Acceptance of Reward**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** The restaurant owners offered a reward for the recovery of the parrot, and the issue is whether Imogen or Jack can claim it.

- **Legal Concept 2: State of Mind and Knowledge of Reward**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** The state of mind and knowledge of Imogen and Jack regarding the reward are crucial in determining their entitlement. Imogen was unaware of the reward when she found the parrot, while Jack knew about the reward when he reported the parrot's location.

- **Legal Concept 3: Performance of the Act**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** The performance of the act (reporting the parrot) by Jack and Imogen is under scrutiny to determine entitlement to the reward. Imogen found the parrot but did not report it, while Jack reported it knowing about the reward.

- **Legal Concept 4: Legal Entitlement to Reward**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** The legal entitlement to the reward is questioned based on the actions and knowledge of Imogen and Jack. The restaurant owners argue that Imogen cannot claim the reward as she did not know about it, and they refuse to pay Jack as they feel he did nothing towards the recovery of the bird.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HKSAR v So Kam Tim. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Fairness and Prevention of Unjust Enrichment:** The court should consider the state of mind and knowledge of the parties involved. Imogen, who found the parrot without knowledge of the reward, should not be unjustly enriched. Jack, who reported the parrot knowing about the reward, acted with the intention to claim it.

2. **Encouragement of Honesty and Transparency:** By ruling that the reward should be given to the person who acted with knowledge of the reward, the court would encourage individuals to act transparently and honestly when claiming rewards.

3. **Clarity in Contractual Obligations:** The decision would provide clarity in similar cases where rewards are offered, emphasizing the importance of the offeror's and offeree's state of mind and knowledge.

Therefore, the court should rule that Jack is entitled to the reward as he acted with the knowledge of the reward and reported the parrot's location. Imogen, although she found the parrot, did not act with the knowledge of the reward and therefore should not be entitled to it. This outcome aligns with the principles established in HKSAR v So Kam Tim and promotes fairness and clarity in contractual obligations.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case

In the precedent case HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the legal concept of the state of mind of the person offering the reward. This concept was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as fairness and the prevention of unjust enrichment, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it focused on the intention behind the offer of the reward rather than the actual performance of the act. However, in our current case, this crucial concept of the state of mind of the person offering the reward is notably absent as the issue revolves around the state of mind and knowledge of the person who found the parrot (Imogen) and the person who reported it (Jack), rather than the person offering the reward (the restaurant owners).

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case

Our current case involves an important factor, the knowledge of the reward by the person who found the parrot (Imogen), that was not present in HKSAR v So Kam Tim. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the entitlement to the reward in our case hinges on whether Imogen knew about the reward when she found the parrot. Due to this factor, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as unfairly denying Imogen any share of the reward despite her role in finding the parrot, than positive ones, unlike in HKSAR v So Kam Tim. This is because the precedent case focused on the state of mind of the person offering the reward, whereas our case requires consideration of the state of mind and actions of the person who found and reported the parrot.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from HKSAR v So Kam Tim should be stated as: "When both the offer of a reward and the state of mind of the person offering the reward are present, the court should decide based on the knowledge and actions of the parties regarding the reward." Omitting the state of mind of the person offering the reward from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of unfairly denying a reward to someone who acted in good faith and with knowledge of the reward. Indeed, the opinion in HKSAR v So Kam Tim explicitly states that the state of mind of the person offering the reward was crucial to their decision, as it emphasized the importance of the intention behind the offer of the reward rather than the actual performance of the act.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in HKSAR v So Kam Tim was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of unjust enrichment and to ensure that the offering of a reward itself constituted the offence, regardless of whether the act was performed. However, in our current case, there's no risk of unjust enrichment occurring because the issue revolves around the state of mind and knowledge of the person who found the parrot (Imogen) and the person who reported it (Jack), rather than the person offering the reward (the restaurant owners). Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The focus should be on the knowledge and actions of Imogen and Jack regarding the reward to determine their legal entitlement.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of the state of mind of the person offering the reward, which was present in the precedent case HKSAR v So Kam Tim, requiring this factor for all similar cases of reward claims would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would unfairly deny rewards to individuals who acted in good faith and with knowledge of the reward, thereby discouraging honest and transparent behavior. Conversely, not requiring the state of mind of the person offering the reward would allow for a more equitable distribution of rewards based on the actions and knowledge of the claimants. This better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and the prevention of unjust enrichment in contract law.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of the state of mind of the person offering the reward, which was present in HKSAR v So Kam Tim, we have the additional factor of the knowledge and actions of the person who found and reported the parrot. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of the reward offer, serves a similar function to the state of mind of the person offering the reward in the precedent case. Given the presence of the knowledge and actions of Imogen and Jack, we submit that the reasoning in HKSAR v So Kam Tim still applies. The positive effects on relevant legal values, such as fairness and the encouragement of honest behavior, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. Therefore, the court should consider the knowledge and actions of Imogen and Jack to determine their legal entitlement to the reward.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the legal concepts of offer and acceptance of a reward, the state of mind and knowledge of the parties involved, and the performance of the act. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly in the absence of the state of mind of the person offering the reward in the current case, and the presence of the knowledge and actions of the person who found and reported the parrot.

The proposed legal rule from HKSAR v So Kam Tim, which emphasizes the state of mind of the person offering the reward, finds support in both cases but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of fairness and the prevention of unjust enrichment (as argued in favor of Jack) and the need to consider the knowledge and actions of the person who found the parrot (as argued in favor of Imogen).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, prevention of unjust enrichment, and encouragement of honest behavior, we conclude that the reward should be shared between Imogen and Jack. Imogen, who found the parrot, acted in good faith even though she was unaware of the reward at the time. Jack, who reported the parrot with knowledge of the reward, also acted with the intention to claim it. Therefore, both parties contributed to the recovery of the parrot and should be entitled to a share of the reward.

This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by recognizing the contributions of both parties and ensuring a fair distribution of the reward. The key factors that influenced this outcome include the actions and knowledge of both Imogen and Jack, the principles of fairness, and the prevention of unjust enrichment.


# Contract Law: Whether the concept of 'consideration' is satisfied in the context of the reward offer and acceptance

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 4 Subsections 1-4

### Major Premise:

1. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 4 Subsections 1-4

   Conditions:
   - A third party is expressly identified in the contract by name, as a member of a class or as answering a particular description
   - The contract expressly provides that the third party may enforce a term of the contract
   - The term purports to confer a benefit on the third party

   Consequences:
   - The third party may enforce the term of the contract

   Exceptions:
   - On a proper construction of the contract, the term is not intended to be enforceable by the third party
   - The enforcement of the term by a third party is subject to any other term of the contract relevant to the term

### Minor Premise:

1. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 4 Subsections 1-4:
- Imogen found the parrot and provided the information leading to its recovery.
- The reward offer (contract) was made to the public, and Imogen, as a member of the public, fits the description of the third party.
- The reward offer expressly provides that the third party (the person who provides information leading to the recovery of the parrot) may enforce the term of the contract.
- The term (reward) purports to confer a benefit on the third party (Imogen).

   Therefore, Imogen may enforce the term of the contract.

### Conclusion:

Imogen has a legal claim to the reward money offered as she satisfies the conditions under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 4 Subsections 1-4. Jack does not have a legal claim to the reward money as he did not provide the information leading to the recovery of the parrot.

## Deductive Reasoning: ca

### Relevant law:

Contract Law - Consideration

### Major Premise:

1. CACV 170/2017 [2018] HKCA 107

   Conditions:
   - An employee refrains from exercising the right to terminate the contract of employment
   - The employer obtains a real benefit or obviates a disbenefit as a result of the employee's continued employment

   Consequences:
   - The non-exercise of the right to terminate the contract of employment can be good consideration for a variation of the terms of employment

   Exceptions:
   - The promise is given as a result of economic duress or fraud

### Minor Premise:

1. CACV 170/2017 [2018] HKCA 107:
   - The scenario involves a reward offer and acceptance, not an employment contract. Therefore, the conditions related to refraining from terminating an employment contract and the employer obtaining a benefit do not apply directly.
   - However, the principle of consideration can be analogously applied to determine if Jack or Imogen provided consideration for the reward.

### Analysis:

- Imogen found the parrot and informed Jack, but she was unaware of the reward at the time of finding the parrot.
- Jack reported the parrot's location to Wilf, but he did not directly contribute to the recovery of the parrot.
- The owners argue that Imogen cannot claim the reward as she was unaware of it, and Jack did not contribute to the recovery.

### Conclusion:

Neither Jack nor Imogen provided consideration for the reward in the context of the legal framework provided. Imogen was unaware of the reward when she found the parrot, and Jack did not perform any act that directly led to the recovery of the parrot. Therefore, neither Jack nor Imogen has a legal claim to the reward money offered.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HKSAR v So Kam Tim)
In the case of HKSAR v So Kam Tim (precedent p), the court dealt with the issue of whether the acceptance of a reward or advantage must be contingent upon the actual performance of the act for which the reward was offered. The court ruled that the offence of soliciting or accepting an advantage is complete at the moment the solicitation or acceptance is made, regardless of whether the act or omission for which the reward was offered is actually performed. The court emphasized that the state of mind of the person accepting the advantage is what matters, not the actual performance of the act.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HKSAR v So Kam Tim and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Offer and Acceptance of Reward**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the acceptance of a bribe was considered complete upon acceptance, regardless of whether the act was performed. In the current case, Jack accepted the reward offer by providing the information leading to the recovery of the parrot.
- **Legal Concept 2: State of Mind and Intention**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the court focused on the state of mind of the person accepting the advantage. In the current case, Jack intended to claim the reward by providing the necessary information, and Imogen, upon learning of the reward, also intended to claim it.
- **Legal Concept 3: Performance of the Act**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the actual performance of the act (not prosecuting) was deemed irrelevant to the completion of the offence. In the current case, the actual recovery of the parrot is not necessary for the claim to the reward; the provision of information leading to the recovery is sufficient.
- **Legal Concept 4: Knowledge of the Reward**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the knowledge and intention of the person accepting the advantage were crucial. In the current case, Imogen did not initially know of the reward, but Jack did, and he acted upon that knowledge.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HKSAR v So Kam Tim)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of an offer and acceptance of a reward, with the intention to claim the reward, the court should decide that the reward is claimable regardless of the actual performance of the act for which the reward was offered. This rule was justified in HKSAR v So Kam Tim because focusing on the state of mind and intention of the person accepting the advantage aligns with the underlying principles of ensuring that corrupt intentions are penalized, and it simplifies the legal process by not requiring proof of the actual performance of the act. 

Applying this rule to the current case:
- **Jack**: Jack knew of the reward and provided the information leading to the recovery of the parrot with the intention of claiming the reward. Therefore, he has a legal claim to the reward money.
- **Imogen**: Although Imogen did not initially know of the reward, she found the parrot and informed Jack, who then acted on her behalf. Given that she later learned of the reward and expressed her intention to claim it, she may also have a claim, especially if it can be argued that Jack acted as her agent in reporting the parrot.

Thus, both Jack and Imogen have potential legal claims to the reward money offered, with Jack having a stronger claim due to his direct action and knowledge of the reward.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HKSAR v So Kam Tim) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Offer and Acceptance of Reward**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the acceptance of a bribe was considered complete upon acceptance, regardless of whether the act was performed. In the current case, Jack accepted the reward offer by providing the information leading to the recovery of the parrot.

- **Legal Concept 2: State of Mind and Intention**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the court focused on the state of mind of the person accepting the advantage. In the current case, Jack intended to claim the reward by providing the necessary information, and Imogen, upon learning of the reward, also intended to claim it.

- **Legal Concept 3: Performance of the Act**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the actual performance of the act (not prosecuting) was deemed irrelevant to the completion of the offence. In the current case, the actual recovery of the parrot is not necessary for the claim to the reward; the provision of information leading to the recovery is sufficient.

- **Legal Concept 4: Knowledge of the Reward**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the knowledge and intention of the person accepting the advantage were crucial. In the current case, Imogen did not initially know of the reward, but Jack did, and he acted upon that knowledge.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HKSAR v So Kam Tim, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Clarity and Simplicity in Legal Proceedings**: By focusing on the state of mind and intention of the person accepting the reward, the court can avoid the complexities of proving the actual performance of the act, thereby simplifying legal proceedings.

2. **Encouragement of Honest Reporting**: Recognizing the claim of the person who acted upon the reward offer (Jack) encourages individuals to report valuable information promptly, knowing that their actions will be rewarded based on their intention and not contingent upon the actual recovery.

3. **Fairness and Equity**: Allowing both Jack and Imogen to claim the reward acknowledges their respective contributions. Jack acted on the information with the intention of claiming the reward, and Imogen, upon learning of the reward, expressed her intention to claim it. This ensures that both parties are treated fairly based on their actions and intentions.

4. **Promotion of Public Policy**: Reward systems are designed to incentivize the public to assist in certain matters, such as the recovery of lost property. By upholding the claims of those who act upon such offers, the court reinforces the effectiveness of these reward systems.

Therefore, both Jack and Imogen have potential legal claims to the reward money offered, with Jack having a stronger claim due to his direct action and knowledge of the reward. This decision aligns with the principles established in HKSAR v So Kam Tim and promotes the underlying values of clarity, fairness, and public policy.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the factor of the state of mind and intention of the person accepting the advantage. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as clarity and simplicity in legal proceedings, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it allowed the court to focus on the corrupt intention rather than the actual performance of the act. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of the state of mind and intention is notably absent as Imogen did not initially know of the reward when she found the parrot and informed Jack. Her actions were not influenced by the reward offer, which complicates the application of the same legal principles.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor of agency that was not present in HKSAR v So Kam Tim. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because Jack acted on behalf of Imogen when he reported the parrot's location to Wilf. Due to this agency relationship, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the principles of fairness and equity than positive ones, unlike in HKSAR v So Kam Tim. This is because Imogen, who actually found the parrot, would be unfairly deprived of the reward despite her significant contribution, simply because she was unaware of the reward at the time of her actions.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HKSAR v So Kam Tim should be stated as: "When both the intention to claim a reward and the knowledge of the reward are present, the court should decide that the reward is claimable regardless of the actual performance of the act for which the reward was offered." Omitting the knowledge of the reward from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of unfairly depriving individuals who significantly contribute to the desired outcome but were unaware of the reward at the time of their actions. Indeed, the opinion in HKSAR v So Kam Tim explicitly states that the state of mind and intention of the person accepting the advantage were crucial to their decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HKSAR v So Kam Tim was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of focusing on the actual performance of the act rather than the corrupt intention behind accepting an advantage. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because the issue is not about corrupt intention but about the fair distribution of a reward for the recovery of a lost parrot. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the focus should be on ensuring fairness and equity in rewarding those who contributed to the recovery, regardless of their initial knowledge of the reward.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of the state of mind and intention of the person accepting the advantage, which was present in the precedent case HKSAR v So Kam Tim, requiring this factor for all similar cases of reward claims would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would unfairly deprive individuals who significantly contribute to the desired outcome but were unaware of the reward at the time of their actions. Conversely, not requiring the knowledge of the reward would allow for a more equitable distribution of rewards, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and equity in contract law. This approach ensures that those who contribute to the recovery of lost property are recognized and rewarded for their efforts, regardless of their initial knowledge of the reward.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of the state of mind and intention of the person accepting the advantage, which was present in HKSAR v So Kam Tim, we have the additional factor of agency. This factor of agency, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of the offer and acceptance of a reward, serves a similar function to the state of mind and intention in the precedent case. Given the presence of agency, we submit that the reasoning in HKSAR v So Kam Tim still applies, as the positive effects on fairness and equity would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. The agency relationship between Jack and Imogen ensures that both parties' contributions are recognized, and the reward is distributed fairly based on their respective actions and intentions.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HKSAR v So Kam Tim, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in the context of the offer and acceptance of a reward and the focus on the state of mind and intention of the person accepting the advantage. However, it also differs significantly in that Imogen did not initially know of the reward when she found the parrot, and the factor of agency is present in the current case.

The proposed legal rule from HKSAR v So Kam Tim, which emphasizes the state of mind and intention of the person accepting the advantage, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in the context of fairness and equity in rewarding those who contribute to the recovery of lost property.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that Jack acted with the intention to claim the reward and provided the necessary information, and the counterargument that Imogen, who actually found the parrot, should not be unfairly deprived of the reward due to her initial lack of knowledge.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, equity, and the promotion of public policy, we conclude that both Jack and Imogen have potential legal claims to the reward money offered. Jack has a stronger claim due to his direct action and knowledge of the reward, but Imogen's contribution should also be recognized, especially given the agency relationship between them.

Therefore, the reward should be distributed in a manner that acknowledges both parties' contributions. A fair and equitable solution would be to split the reward between Jack and Imogen, with Jack receiving a larger portion due to his direct action and knowledge of the reward, and Imogen receiving a portion in recognition of her significant contribution in finding the parrot.

This decision aligns with the principles established in HKSAR v So Kam Tim and promotes the underlying values of clarity, fairness, and public policy. It ensures that both parties are treated fairly based on their actions and intentions, and it reinforces the effectiveness of reward systems in incentivizing the public to assist in certain matters.
