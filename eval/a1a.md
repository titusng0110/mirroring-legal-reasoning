# Contract Law: Whether the additional £5,000 for the work on the drains constitutes a variation of the original contract

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2 and 3

### Major Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - A contract governed by law applicable to the Colony has become impossible of performance or been otherwise frustrated.
   - The parties thereto have for that reason been discharged from the further performance of the contract.

   Consequences:
   - All sums paid or payable to any party in pursuance of the contract before the time when the parties were so discharged shall, in the case of sums so paid, be recoverable from him as money received by him for the use of the party by whom the sums were paid.
   - In the case of sums so payable, cease to be so payable.

   Exceptions:
   - The party to whom the sums were so paid or payable incurred expenses before the time of discharge in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, the court may, if it considers it just to do so having regard to all the circumstances of the case, allow him to retain or, as the case may be, recover the whole or any part of the sums so paid or payable, not being an amount in excess of the expenses so incurred.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3

   Conditions:
   - Any party to the contract has, by reason of anything done by any other party thereto in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, obtained a valuable benefit (other than a payment of money to which subsection (2) applies) before the time of discharge.

   Consequences:
   - There shall be recoverable from him by the said other party such sum (if any), not exceeding the value of the said benefit to the party obtaining it, as the court considers just, having regard to all the circumstances of the case.

   Exceptions:
   - The amount of any expenses incurred before the time of discharge by the benefited party in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, including any sums paid or payable by him to any other party in pursuance of the contract and retained or recoverable by that party under subsection (2).
   - The effect, in relation to the said benefit, of the circumstances giving rise to the frustration of the contract.

### Minor Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2:
- The contract between Gabrielle, Zolt, and Pyrotechnics Ltd has not become impossible of performance or been otherwise frustrated.
- The parties have not been discharged from the further performance of the contract.
- Therefore, this section does not apply.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3:
- Pyrotechnics Ltd has performed additional work (relocating the drains) and rescheduled other work, paying their staff overtime to ensure the project was completed on time.
- Gabrielle and Zolt have obtained a valuable benefit from this additional work and timely completion.
- The additional £5,000 for the work on the drains and the £3,000 bonus were agreed upon as part of the performance of the contract.
- Gabrielle and Zolt have not incurred any expenses before the time of discharge in relation to the additional work or bonus.
- The circumstances giving rise to the frustration of the contract do not apply here as the contract was completed on time.

### Conclusion:

Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3 applies, and Pyrotechnics Ltd can bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000, as Gabrielle and Zolt have obtained a valuable benefit from the additional work and timely completion.

### Relevant law:

WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD [2024] HKCFI 45

### Major Premise:

1. WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD [2024] HKCFI 45

   Conditions:
   - Work is requested or instructed which is in fact outside the scope of the variation clause.
   - The Contractor complies with it without objection.
   - The request or instruction is that of the Employer not the Architect, Engineer, or Contract Administrator under the variation clause, and/or no specific reference is made to the variation clause.

   Consequences:
   - The Contractor will be entitled to reasonable remuneration on the basis of an implied reasonable price under a separate contract.

   Exceptions:
   - The Contractor is estopped or deemed to have waived any right to payment other than that obtainable under the terms of the clause.

### Minor Premise:

1. WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD [2024] HKCFI 45:
   - Pyrotechnics Ltd was requested to perform additional work (relocating the drains) which was outside the scope of the original contract.
   - Pyrotechnics Ltd complied with the request without objection.
   - The request was made by Gabrielle and Zolt (the Employers), not by an Architect, Engineer, or Contract Administrator, and no specific reference was made to the variation clause.
   - Therefore, Pyrotechnics Ltd is entitled to reasonable remuneration for the additional work on the basis of an implied reasonable price under a separate contract.
   - There is no indication that Pyrotechnics Ltd is estopped or has waived any right to payment other than that obtainable under the terms of the clause.

### Conclusion:

Pyrotechnics Ltd can bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000. The additional work on the drains constitutes a variation of the original contract, and Pyrotechnics Ltd is entitled to reasonable remuneration for this work under a separate implied contract. Additionally, the bonus of £3,000 promised for completing the work on schedule is enforceable as a separate agreement.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD)

In the case of WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD [2024] HKCFI 45; HCCT 57/2020 (precedent p), the court ruled that the Varied Contractor Agreement (VCA) was not void for uncertainty and that the additional works were not included in the original lump sum contract. The court found that the additional works were separately agreed upon and thus entitled Wah Sung to additional payment beyond the original contract sum.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Variation of Contract**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In the precedent case, the court considered whether the additional works (the Excepted List) were part of the original contract or a separate agreement. Similarly, in our current case, the additional £5,000 for the work on the drains needs to be assessed as a variation of the original contract.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Agreement on Additional Works**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In the precedent case, the court found that the additional works were separately agreed upon and not included in the original lump sum. In our current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd and Gabrielle agreed on the additional £5,000 for the drain work and the £3,000 bonus for timely completion, indicating a separate agreement for these additional works.
  
- **Legal Concept 3: Contractual Obligations and Payments**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In the precedent case, the court ruled that the contractor was entitled to additional payment for works not covered by the original contract sum. In our current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd is seeking additional payment for the drain work and the bonus, which were not part of the original £80,000 contract sum.
  
- **Legal Concept 4: Full and Final Settlement**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In the precedent case, the court did not find any evidence that the additional works were included in the full and final settlement of the original contract. In our current case, Gabrielle's assertion that the £40,000 should be taken as full and final settlement is contested by Pyrotechnics Ltd, who argue that the additional works were separately agreed upon and should be compensated.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern where additional works are separately agreed upon and not included in the original contract sum, the court should decide that the contractor is entitled to additional payment for those works. This rule was justified in WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that contractors are fairly compensated for additional work outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially increasing the overall cost for the client. This promotes fairness and clarity in contractual obligations and ensures that contractors are not unfairly burdened with additional costs that were not part of the original agreement.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Variation of Contract**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, there is a question of whether additional works (the Excepted List in the precedent and the drain work in the current case) constitute a variation of the original contract. In the precedent, the court found that the additional works were a separate agreement. Similarly, in our current case, the additional £5,000 for the drain work was separately agreed upon by Pyrotechnics Ltd and Gabrielle.

- **Legal Concept 2: Agreement on Additional Works**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In the precedent case, the court found that the additional works were separately agreed upon and not included in the original lump sum. In our current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd and Gabrielle agreed on the additional £5,000 for the drain work and the £3,000 bonus for timely completion, indicating a separate agreement for these additional works.

- **Legal Concept 3: Contractual Obligations and Payments**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In the precedent case, the court ruled that the contractor was entitled to additional payment for works not covered by the original contract sum. In our current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd is seeking additional payment for the drain work and the bonus, which were not part of the original £80,000 contract sum.

- **Legal Concept 4: Full and Final Settlement**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In the precedent case, the court did not find any evidence that the additional works were included in the full and final settlement of the original contract. In our current case, Gabrielle's assertion that the £40,000 should be taken as full and final settlement is contested by Pyrotechnics Ltd, who argue that the additional works were separately agreed upon and should be compensated.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Fair Compensation**: Ensuring that contractors are fairly compensated for additional work promotes fairness and prevents unjust enrichment of the client at the contractor's expense.
2. **Clarity in Contractual Obligations**: Recognizing separate agreements for additional works provides clarity in contractual obligations and helps avoid disputes over what is included in the original contract sum.
3. **Encouragement of Good Faith Negotiations**: Upholding agreements for additional works encourages parties to negotiate in good faith and honor their commitments, fostering a more reliable and trustworthy business environment.

Therefore, Pyrotechnics Ltd should be entitled to recover the additional £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000, as these were separately agreed upon and not part of the original contract sum.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, **the financial hardship claimed by Gabrielle**, that was not present in **WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because Gabrielle's financial hardship and the departure of Zolt introduce a potential defense of economic duress or undue influence. Due to this financial hardship, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as **potentially unfairly burdening Gabrielle with additional financial obligations** than positive ones, unlike in **WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD** because the precedent case did not involve a party claiming financial incapacity or undue influence in the agreement of additional works.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from **WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD** should be stated as: "When both [the additional works are separately agreed upon and not included in the original contract sum] and [the client does not claim financial hardship or undue influence in agreeing to the additional works] are present, the court should decide [that the contractor is entitled to additional payment for those works]." Omitting [the client's financial hardship or undue influence] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of unfairly burdening clients who are under financial duress or undue influence with additional financial obligations]. Indeed, the opinion in **WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD** did not consider financial hardship or undue influence as it was not a factor in their decision, which highlights the importance of including this consideration in our rule.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in **WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of contractors not being fairly compensated for additional works that were separately agreed upon]. However, in our current case, there's a significant risk of [unfairly burdening Gabrielle, who claims financial hardship and undue influence, with additional financial obligations]. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The precedent case did not involve a party claiming financial incapacity or undue influence, which is a crucial factor in our current case. Thus, the rule from the precedent should be adapted to account for this additional consideration to ensure fairness and prevent undue hardship.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction

While it's true that our case lacks the factor of **no financial hardship or undue influence**, which was present in the precedent case **WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of **additional works separately agreed upon and not included in the original contract sum** would lead to the undesirable consequence of **potentially allowing clients to evade their contractual obligations by claiming financial hardship or undue influence after the fact**. Conversely, not requiring the absence of financial hardship or undue influence would allow for the desirable outcome of **ensuring that contractors are fairly compensated for additional works that were separately agreed upon**, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, such as **fairness, clarity in contractual obligations, and the enforcement of agreements made in good faith**.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution

Although our case lacks the factor of **no financial hardship or undue influence**, which was present in **WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD**, we have the additional factor of **Gabrielle and Zolt's subsequent financial success and expansion plans**. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of **additional works separately agreed upon and not included in the original contract sum**, serves a similar function to the absence of financial hardship or undue influence in the precedent case. Given the presence of **Gabrielle and Zolt's subsequent financial success and expansion plans**, we submit that the reasoning in **WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD** still applies, as the positive effects on **fair compensation, clarity in contractual obligations, and encouragement of good faith negotiations** would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in the context of additional works being separately agreed upon and not included in the original contract sum. However, it also differs in significant ways, notably the financial hardship claimed by Gabrielle and the subsequent financial success and expansion plans of Gabrielle and Zolt.

The proposed legal rule that "when additional works are separately agreed upon and not included in the original contract sum, the contractor is entitled to additional payment for those works" finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the financial hardship and potential undue influence claimed by Gabrielle.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point from Pyrotechnics Ltd that they should be fairly compensated for the additional works and the bonus, as these were separately agreed upon. On the other hand, Gabrielle's claim of financial hardship and the assertion that the £40,000 should be taken as full and final settlement introduces a potential defense of economic duress or undue influence.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, clarity in contractual obligations, and the enforcement of agreements made in good faith, we conclude that Pyrotechnics Ltd should be entitled to recover the additional £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000. This decision aligns with the precedent set in **WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD**, ensuring that contractors are fairly compensated for additional works that were separately agreed upon.

However, given the claim of financial hardship, the court should also consider whether Gabrielle's agreement to the additional works and the bonus was made under economic duress or undue influence. If such a defense is substantiated, it could potentially alter the outcome. Therefore, while the general rule supports Pyrotechnics Ltd's claim, the specific circumstances of financial hardship and potential undue influence should be carefully examined in court to ensure a just and equitable resolution.

   Consequences:
   - Such condition shall be void

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 6 Subsection 1:
- Pyrotechnics Ltd is a supplier acting in the course of a business.
- The time for the service to be carried out (refurbishment) was not fixed by the contract.
- The time was not left to be fixed in a manner agreed by the contract.
- The time was not determined by the course of dealing between the parties.
- Therefore, there is an implied term that Pyrotechnics Ltd will carry out the service within a reasonable time.

2. Employment Ordinance Cap. 57 Section 11AA Subsection 1:
- The promise to pay a bonus of £3,000 for completing the work on time is not an annual payment or annual bonus.
- Therefore, this section does not apply.

3. Employment Ordinance Cap. 57 Section 21:
- The promise to pay a bonus of £3,000 for completing the work on time is not an annual bonus or end of year payment.
- Therefore, this section does not apply.

### Conclusion:

The promise to pay a bonus of £3,000 for completing the work on time does not fall under the Employment Ordinance Cap. 57 Sections 11AA or 21. However, under the Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 6 Subsection 1, there is an implied term that Pyrotechnics Ltd will carry out the service within a reasonable time. Given that Pyrotechnics Ltd completed the work on time, they are entitled to the £3,000 bonus as it was a binding contractual obligation. Additionally, Pyrotechnics Ltd can bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the additional work on the drains as it was an agreed variation to the original contract.

Williams v Roffey Brothers & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd [1991] 1 QB 1

### Major Premise:

1. Williams v Roffey Brothers & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd [1991] 1 QB 1

   Conditions:
   - A has entered into a contract with B to do work for, or to supply goods or services to, B in return for payment by B.
   - At some stage before A has completely performed his obligations under the contract, B has reason to doubt whether A will, or will be able to, complete his side of the bargain.
   - B thereupon promises A an additional payment in return for A’s promise to perform his contractual obligations on time.
   - As a result of giving his promise, B obtains in practice a benefit, or obviates a disbenefit.
   - B’s promise is not given as a result of economic duress or fraud on the part of A.

   Consequences:
   - The benefit to B is capable of being consideration for B’s promise, so that the promisee will be legally binding.

   Exceptions:
   - It is given as a result of economic duress or fraud.

### Minor Premise:

1. Williams v Roffey Brothers & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd [1991] 1 QB 1:
   - Pyrotechnics Ltd (A) has entered into a contract with Gabrielle and Zolt (B) to refurbish their Flame Bar and Grill in return for payment of £80,000.
   - Before Pyrotechnics Ltd has completely performed its obligations, Gabrielle and Zolt have reason to doubt whether Pyrotechnics Ltd will complete the work on time due to the additional work required for the drains.
   - Gabrielle and Zolt promise Pyrotechnics Ltd an additional payment of £3,000 if the work stays on schedule.
   - As a result of this promise, Gabrielle and Zolt obtain the benefit of opening Gabrizo on time.
   - There is no indication that Gabrielle and Zolt’s promise was given as a result of economic duress or fraud on the part of Pyrotechnics Ltd.

### Conclusion:

Williams v Roffey Brothers & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd [1991] 1 QB 1 applies, and the promise to pay the bonus of £3,000 for completing the work on time constitutes a binding contractual obligation. Therefore, Pyrotechnics Ltd can bring an action to recover the £3,000 promised bonus.

### Additional Consideration:

Regarding the £5,000 for the additional work on the drains, this would depend on whether the original contract included such unforeseen work. If the original contract did not cover the relocation of the drains, Pyrotechnics Ltd may have a valid claim for the additional £5,000 as extra work outside the scope of the original agreement. However, this would require further examination of the terms of the original contract and any relevant communications between the parties.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA000315A/1999 BETWEEN CHEUNG SHUET LEE Plaintiff AND BIRKART-EAST WEST FREIGHT LIMITED Defendant)
In the case of HCA000315A/1999 BETWEEN CHEUNG SHUET LEE Plaintiff AND BIRKART-EAST WEST FREIGHT LIMITED Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the plaintiff's claim for additional compensation was dismissed because there was no valid consideration for the alleged settlement agreement, and the defendant's approval of the computation was based on a misrepresentation by the plaintiff. The court found that the plaintiff's actions did not constitute good consideration for the promise of additional payment, and thus, the defendant was not legally bound to pay the additional amount.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA000315A/1999 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Consideration**: In both cases, the issue of whether the additional promise (compensation/bonus) was supported by valid consideration is central.
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA000315A/1999, the plaintiff's cooperation and preparation of the budget were deemed insufficient as consideration. In the current case, Gabrielle and Zolt's promise to pay a £3,000 bonus for timely completion must be examined for valid consideration.
- **Legal Concept 2: Misrepresentation**: The precedent case involved misrepresentation by the plaintiff regarding her entitlement.
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In the current case, Gabrielle's assertion that the additional £5,000 for the drains should be absorbed by Pyrotechnics Ltd could be seen as a misrepresentation of the original agreement.
- **Legal Concept 3: Duress**: The precedent case considered whether the agreement was made under duress.
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In the current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd might argue that they agreed to the £40,000 settlement under economic duress due to their own creditors' pressure.
- **Legal Concept 4: Contractual Obligation**: Both cases involve the question of whether the parties entered into a binding contractual obligation for additional payments.
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCA000315A/1999, the court found no binding agreement for additional compensation. In the current case, the binding nature of the £3,000 bonus and the additional £5,000 for the drains needs to be determined.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA000315A/1999)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a promise for additional payment without valid consideration, the court should decide that the promise is not legally binding. This rule was justified in HCA000315A/1999 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that only promises supported by valid consideration are enforceable outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially allowing parties to make and then retract promises without consequence. This upholds the underlying values of contract law, which require consideration for enforceability and protect against agreements made under duress or misrepresentation.

Therefore, applying this rule to the current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd can argue that the promise of the £3,000 bonus lacks valid consideration, as the rescheduling and overtime work were part of their existing contractual obligations. Additionally, the £5,000 for the drains should be recoverable as it was an unforeseen additional cost not included in the original agreement, and Gabrielle's assertion to absorb it could be seen as a misrepresentation. Thus, Pyrotechnics Ltd should be able to bring an action to recover both the £5,000 for the drains and the £3,000 bonus.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA000315A/1999 BETWEEN CHEUNG SHUET LEE Plaintiff AND BIRKART-EAST WEST FREIGHT LIMITED Defendant) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Consideration**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA000315A/1999, the plaintiff's cooperation and preparation of the budget were deemed insufficient as consideration. Similarly, in the current case, Gabrielle and Zolt's promise to pay a £3,000 bonus for timely completion must be examined for valid consideration. Pyrotechnics Ltd rescheduled other work and paid their staff overtime, but these actions were part of their existing contractual obligations to complete the refurbishment.

- **Legal Concept 2: Misrepresentation**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In the precedent case, the plaintiff misrepresented her entitlement. In the current case, Gabrielle's assertion that the additional £5,000 for the drains should be absorbed by Pyrotechnics Ltd could be seen as a misrepresentation of the original agreement, as the need to relocate the drains was an unforeseen additional cost not included in the original £80,000 quote.

- **Legal Concept 3: Duress**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: The precedent case considered whether the agreement was made under duress. In the current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd might argue that they agreed to the £40,000 settlement under economic duress due to their own creditors' pressure, similar to how Mr Mahncke was pressured in the precedent case.

- **Legal Concept 4: Contractual Obligation**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: Both cases involve the question of whether the parties entered into a binding contractual obligation for additional payments. In HCA000315A/1999, the court found no binding agreement for additional compensation. In the current case, the binding nature of the £3,000 bonus and the additional £5,000 for the drains needs to be determined.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCA000315A/1999. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding the Requirement of Valid Consideration**: Enforcing the rule that only promises supported by valid consideration are enforceable ensures that parties cannot claim additional payments without providing something of value in return. This maintains the integrity of contractual agreements and prevents unjust enrichment.

2. **Preventing Misrepresentation**: By not allowing Gabrielle's misrepresentation regarding the £5,000 additional cost to stand, the court would deter parties from making false claims about the scope of original agreements. This promotes honesty and transparency in contractual dealings.

3. **Protecting Against Economic Duress**: Recognizing that Pyrotechnics Ltd agreed to the £40,000 settlement under economic duress would protect businesses from being forced into unfavorable agreements due to financial pressure. This ensures that agreements are made voluntarily and fairly.

4. **Clarifying Contractual Obligations**: Determining that the £3,000 bonus and the additional £5,000 for the drains were not part of the original contractual obligations would provide clarity on what constitutes a binding agreement. This helps parties understand their rights and obligations under a contract.

Therefore, Pyrotechnics Ltd should be able to bring an action to recover both the £5,000 for the drains and the £3,000 bonus, as the promise for the bonus lacks valid consideration, and the additional cost for the drains was an unforeseen expense not included in the original agreement.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA000315A/1999 BETWEEN CHEUNG SHUET LEE Plaintiff AND BIRKART-EAST WEST FREIGHT LIMITED Defendant, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the factor of **misrepresentation** by the plaintiff. Misrepresentation was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling (upholding the requirement of valid consideration and preventing unjust enrichment) outweighed any potential drawbacks because it demonstrated that the plaintiff had dishonestly inflated her entitlement, thereby undermining the integrity of the contractual agreement.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of **misrepresentation** is notably absent. Gabrielle's assertion that the additional £5,000 for the drains should be absorbed by Pyrotechnics Ltd does not constitute a clear misrepresentation of her entitlement under the original contract. Instead, it appears to be a dispute over the interpretation of the scope of the original agreement. Therefore, the absence of clear misrepresentation in the current case weakens the argument that the additional £5,000 should be absorbed by Pyrotechnics Ltd based on the precedent.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor of **economic duress** that was not present in HCA000315A/1999 BETWEEN CHEUNG SHUET LEE Plaintiff AND BIRKART-EAST WEST FREIGHT LIMITED Defendant. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because Pyrotechnics Ltd agreed to the £40,000 settlement under the pressure of their own creditors, which could be seen as economic duress.

Due to the presence of economic duress, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as allowing parties to exploit financial pressures to avoid fulfilling their contractual obligations. Unlike in HCA000315A/1999, where the plaintiff's misrepresentation was a clear factor, the economic duress in our current case suggests that Pyrotechnics Ltd's agreement to the £40,000 settlement was not entirely voluntary. Therefore, the court should consider the impact of economic duress and allow Pyrotechnics Ltd to recover the additional £5,000 for the drains and the £3,000 bonus, as the agreement to settle for £40,000 was made under undue pressure.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA000315A/1999 BETWEEN CHEUNG SHUET LEE Plaintiff AND BIRKART-EAST WEST FREIGHT LIMITED Defendant should be stated as: "When both the fact pattern of a promise for additional payment without valid consideration and the presence of misrepresentation are present, the court should decide that the promise is not legally binding." Omitting the element of misrepresentation from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of allowing parties to retract promises made under economic duress or financial pressure without any accountability. Indeed, the opinion in HCA000315A/1999 explicitly states that the plaintiff's misrepresentation was crucial to their decision, as it demonstrated that the plaintiff had dishonestly inflated her entitlement, thereby undermining the integrity of the contractual agreement.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA000315A/1999 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of parties making and retracting promises based on misrepresented entitlements, thereby ensuring that only promises supported by valid consideration are enforceable. However, in our current case, there's no clear risk of misrepresentation occurring. Instead, the issue revolves around economic duress and the interpretation of the scope of the original agreement. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—preventing misrepresentation—is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should consider the impact of economic duress and the lack of valid consideration for the additional £3,000 bonus, allowing Pyrotechnics Ltd to recover both the £5,000 for the drains and the £3,000 bonus.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the clear factor of **misrepresentation**, which was present in the precedent case HCA000315A/1999 BETWEEN CHEUNG SHUET LEE Plaintiff AND BIRKART-EAST WEST FREIGHT LIMITED Defendant, requiring this factor for all similar cases of promises for additional payment without valid consideration would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would allow parties to avoid fulfilling their contractual obligations by simply not misrepresenting their entitlements, even if they exert economic duress or other forms of undue pressure. Conversely, not requiring the factor of misrepresentation would allow for a more comprehensive protection against unfair practices, such as economic duress, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law. These principles include ensuring that agreements are made voluntarily and fairly, and that parties cannot exploit financial pressures to avoid their obligations.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of **misrepresentation**, which was present in HCA000315A/1999 BETWEEN CHEUNG SHUET LEE Plaintiff AND BIRKART-EAST WEST FREIGHT LIMITED Defendant, we have the additional factor of **economic duress**. This factor of economic duress, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of a promise for additional payment without valid consideration, serves a similar function to misrepresentation in the precedent case. Given the presence of economic duress, we submit that the reasoning in HCA000315A/1999 still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values—such as ensuring voluntary and fair agreements, and protecting against undue pressure—would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

Therefore, Pyrotechnics Ltd should be able to bring an action to recover both the £5,000 for the drains and the £3,000 bonus, as the agreement to settle for £40,000 was made under economic duress and the promise for the bonus lacks valid consideration.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA000315A/1999 BETWEEN CHEUNG SHUET LEE Plaintiff AND BIRKART-EAST WEST FREIGHT LIMITED Defendant, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in the areas of consideration and the binding nature of additional payment promises. However, it also differs significantly in the presence of economic duress and the absence of clear misrepresentation.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case—that promises for additional payment without valid consideration are not legally binding—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the economic duress present in the current case.

**Merits of the Arguments:**
1. **Initial Analogy (Steps 1-4):** The initial analogy correctly identifies the shared legal concepts and fact patterns, particularly the issues of consideration and the binding nature of additional payment promises. It also appropriately applies the rule from the precedent case to the current situation, suggesting that the promise of the £3,000 bonus lacks valid consideration and that the £5,000 for the drains should be recoverable as an unforeseen additional cost.

2. **Distinctions Raised (Steps 5-8):** The distinctions raised highlight the absence of misrepresentation in the current case and the presence of economic duress. These distinctions are crucial as they significantly alter the context and implications of applying the precedent rule. The argument that economic duress should be considered to protect against unfair practices is compelling and aligns with the principles of contract law.

3. **Surrebuttal Arguments (Steps 9-10):** The surrebuttal arguments effectively downplay the significance of the absence of misrepresentation by emphasizing the presence of economic duress. They argue that economic duress serves a similar function to misrepresentation in undermining the voluntary nature of agreements, thus justifying the application of the precedent rule to allow recovery of the additional payments.

**Flaws of the Arguments:**
1. **Initial Analogy (Steps 1-4):** While the initial analogy is well-reasoned, it does not fully account for the impact of economic duress, which is a significant factor in the current case. This oversight could lead to an unjust outcome if the economic pressures faced by Pyrotechnics Ltd are not adequately considered.

2. **Distinctions Raised (Steps 5-8):** The distinctions raised are valid but could be seen as overly focused on the absence of misrepresentation, potentially neglecting the broader implications of economic duress on the fairness of the agreement.

3. **Surrebuttal Arguments (Steps 9-10):** The surrebuttal arguments are strong in highlighting the role of economic duress but may downplay the importance of clear misrepresentation in the precedent case. While economic duress is a significant factor, it is not identical to misrepresentation, and the two should be carefully distinguished.

**Final Decision:**
Considering the underlying legal principles of contract law, including the requirement of valid consideration, the protection against economic duress, and the need for voluntary and fair agreements, we conclude that Pyrotechnics Ltd should be able to bring an action to recover both the £5,000 for the drains and the £3,000 bonus.

**Key Factors Influencing the Outcome:**
1. **Economic Duress:** The agreement to settle for £40,000 was made under economic duress due to Pyrotechnics Ltd's financial pressures, undermining the voluntary nature of the agreement.
2. **Lack of Valid Consideration:** The promise of the £3,000 bonus lacks valid consideration, as the rescheduling and overtime work were part of Pyrotechnics Ltd's existing contractual obligations.
3. **Unforeseen Additional Cost:** The £5,000 for the drains was an unforeseen additional cost not included in the original agreement, and Gabrielle's assertion to absorb it could be seen as an unfair interpretation of the original contract.

Therefore, Pyrotechnics Ltd should be entitled to recover both the £5,000 for the drains and the £3,000 bonus, as the agreement to settle for £40,000 was made under undue pressure and the promise for the bonus lacks valid consideration. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCB 7877/2009 Re: KWONG KA WAI)
In the case of HCB 7877/2009 Re: KWONG KA WAI (precedent p), the debtor, Kwong Ka Wai, failed to repay a loan to Fortis Insurance Company (Asia) Limited. Despite various offers and partial payments, the debtor did not fulfill the repayment terms. The court ruled that the debtor had not demonstrated a bona fide defence on substantive grounds to the debt and made a bankruptcy order against her.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCB 7877/2009 Re: KWONG KA WAI and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Accord and Satisfaction**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCB 7877/2009, the debtor attempted to settle the debt by providing post-dated cheques and negotiating repayment terms, which were not accepted by the creditor. In the current case, Gabrielle attempts to settle the debt by paying £40,000 and claiming it as full and final settlement.

- **Legal Concept 2: Promissory Estoppel**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCB 7877/2009, the debtor argued that the creditor should be estopped from demanding full payment due to an alleged agreement. In the current case, Gabrielle might argue that Pyrotechnics Ltd should be estopped from claiming the additional £8,000 due to their acceptance of the £40,000.

- **Legal Concept 3: Consideration**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCB 7877/2009, the court noted that the agreement lacked consideration as it involved part payment of a debt. In the current case, Gabrielle's payment of £40,000 lacks consideration for the additional £8,000 owed.

- **Legal Concept 4: Inequity in Changing Position**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCB 7877/2009, the court found it was not inequitable for the creditor to change its mind about accepting part payment. In the current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd might argue that it is not inequitable for them to claim the additional £8,000 despite initially accepting the £40,000.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCB 7877/2009)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a debtor attempting to settle a debt by part payment without sufficient consideration and the creditor initially accepting but later changing their mind, the court should decide that the creditor is not bound by the initial acceptance and can claim the full amount owed. This rule was justified in HCB 7877/2009 because the debtor's partial payment and the circumstances did not make it inequitable for the creditor to demand full payment. The positive effects (E+) of ensuring creditors can claim the full amount owed outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially allowing debtors to avoid full repayment through partial settlements.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCB 7877/2009 Re: KWONG KA WAI) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Accord and Satisfaction**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: Gabrielle attempts to settle the debt by paying £40,000 and claiming it as full and final settlement, similar to how the debtor in HCB 7877/2009 attempted to settle the debt by providing post-dated cheques and negotiating repayment terms.

- **Legal Concept 2: Promissory Estoppel**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: Gabrielle might argue that Pyrotechnics Ltd should be estopped from claiming the additional £8,000 due to their acceptance of the £40,000, similar to the debtor's argument in HCB 7877/2009 that the creditor should be estopped from demanding full payment due to an alleged agreement.

- **Legal Concept 3: Consideration**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: Gabrielle's payment of £40,000 lacks consideration for the additional £8,000 owed, similar to the court's finding in HCB 7877/2009 that the agreement lacked consideration as it involved part payment of a debt.

- **Legal Concept 4: Inequity in Changing Position**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: Pyrotechnics Ltd might argue that it is not inequitable for them to claim the additional £8,000 despite initially accepting the £40,000, similar to the court's finding in HCB 7877/2009 that it was not inequitable for the creditor to change its mind about accepting part payment.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCB 7877/2009 Re: KWONG KA WAI. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Contractual Obligations**: Ensuring that parties are held to their original contractual obligations promotes fairness and reliability in commercial transactions. Allowing Gabrielle to settle the debt for less than what was agreed upon without sufficient consideration would undermine the principle of contractual certainty.

2. **Preventing Unjust Enrichment**: Allowing Gabrielle to avoid paying the additional £8,000 would result in unjust enrichment, as she would benefit from the additional work and timely completion without compensating Pyrotechnics Ltd for their extra efforts and costs.

3. **Encouraging Good Faith in Negotiations**: By ruling in favor of Pyrotechnics Ltd, the court would discourage parties from making partial payments or promises without the intention or ability to fulfill their full obligations, thereby promoting good faith in commercial dealings.

4. **Maintaining Creditor Rights**: Protecting the rights of creditors to claim the full amount owed ensures that they are not unfairly disadvantaged, especially when they have already made concessions under financial pressure.

Therefore, applying the rule from HCB 7877/2009 Re: KWONG KA WAI to the current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd should be entitled to bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000. This decision would uphold the principles of contractual obligations, prevent unjust enrichment, encourage good faith in negotiations, and maintain creditor rights.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, namely the **additional work on the drains**, that was not present in HCB 7877/2009 Re: KWONG KA WAI. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of **accord and satisfaction** and **consideration**.

In HCB 7877/2009, the dispute was purely about the repayment of a loan, and there was no additional work or services provided beyond the original agreement. However, in our current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd performed additional work on the drains, which was not part of the original £80,000 contract. This additional work was necessary to comply with building regulations and was agreed upon by Gabrielle and Zolt for an extra £5,000.

Because of this additional work, applying the same outcome as in HCB 7877/2009 would have more negative consequences than positive ones. Specifically:

1. **Unjust Enrichment**: Allowing Gabrielle to avoid paying for the additional work on the drains would result in unjust enrichment, as she would benefit from the necessary compliance work without compensating Pyrotechnics Ltd for their extra efforts and costs.

2. **Fair Compensation for Services Rendered**: Pyrotechnics Ltd should be fairly compensated for the additional work they performed, which was beyond the scope of the original contract. Denying them the additional £5,000 would be unfair and could discourage contractors from performing necessary but unforeseen work in future projects.

3. **Encouraging Compliance with Regulations**: By ruling in favor of Pyrotechnics Ltd, the court would encourage parties to comply with building regulations and ensure that necessary additional work is properly compensated, promoting safety and legal compliance in construction projects.

Due to the presence of this additional work factor, applying the same outcome as in HCB 7877/2009 would not be appropriate. The balance of positive and negative effects is significantly altered, and the court should allow Pyrotechnics Ltd to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from HCB 7877/2009 Re: KWONG KA WAI should be stated as: "When both [a debtor attempts to settle a debt by part payment without sufficient consideration] and [the creditor initially accepts but later changes their mind] are present, the court should decide [that the creditor is not bound by the initial acceptance and can claim the full amount owed]." Omitting [the presence of additional work or services beyond the original agreement] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of unjust enrichment and unfair compensation for services rendered].

Indeed, the opinion in HCB 7877/2009 Re: KWONG KA WAI explicitly states that the debtor's partial payment and the circumstances did not make it inequitable for the creditor to demand full payment. This highlights the importance of considering the context and additional factors, such as the presence of additional work or services, in determining whether the creditor should be bound by the initial acceptance of part payment.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in HCB 7877/2009 Re: KWONG KA WAI was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of debtors avoiding full repayment through partial settlements without sufficient consideration. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence occurring because the additional work on the drains and the promised bonus for timely completion are significant factors that were not present in the precedent case.

Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The additional work and the promised bonus create a different context that justifies allowing Pyrotechnics Ltd to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000. This ensures fair compensation for services rendered and prevents unjust enrichment, aligning with the principles of contractual obligations and good faith in commercial dealings.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of **post-dated cheques** (factor m), which was present in the precedent case HCB 7877/2009 Re: KWONG KA WAI, requiring this factor for all similar cases of **accord and satisfaction** and **consideration** would lead to the undesirable consequence of allowing debtors to avoid their full obligations by merely providing partial payments or promises without any substantial alteration in their position. Conversely, not requiring the factor of post-dated cheques would allow for a more equitable outcome, ensuring that creditors are fairly compensated for additional work and services rendered, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and good faith in contract law.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of **post-dated cheques** (factor m), which was present in HCB 7877/2009 Re: KWONG KA WAI, we have the additional factor of **additional work on the drains** (factor n). This factor n, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of **accord and satisfaction** and **consideration**, serves a similar function to factor m in the precedent case. Given the presence of the additional work on the drains, we submit that the reasoning in HCB 7877/2009 Re: KWONG KA WAI still applies, as the positive effects on ensuring fair compensation for services rendered and preventing unjust enrichment would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

The additional work on the drains represents a significant alteration in the contractual obligations and the position of Pyrotechnics Ltd, similar to how the provision of post-dated cheques represented an alteration in the debtor's position in the precedent case. Therefore, Pyrotechnics Ltd should be entitled to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000, ensuring that they are fairly compensated for their additional efforts and costs.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCB 7877/2009 Re: KWONG KA WAI, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in the areas of accord and satisfaction, promissory estoppel, and consideration. However, it also differs significantly due to the presence of additional work on the drains and the promised bonus for timely completion, which were not factors in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule from HCB 7877/2009 Re: KWONG KA WAI, which allows creditors to claim the full amount owed despite initial acceptance of part payment, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the additional work and services provided by Pyrotechnics Ltd.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point from Pyrotechnics Ltd that they should be fairly compensated for the additional work and the promised bonus, and the counterargument that Gabrielle's acceptance of the £40,000 as full and final settlement should be binding.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, good faith in commercial dealings, and the prevention of unjust enrichment, we conclude that Pyrotechnics Ltd should be entitled to bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by ensuring that parties are held to their contractual obligations and that additional work and services are fairly compensated.

Key factors that influenced this outcome include the necessity and agreement for the additional work on the drains, the efforts made by Pyrotechnics Ltd to complete the project on time, and the principle that creditors should not be unfairly disadvantaged by accepting part payments under financial pressure. Therefore, Pyrotechnics Ltd can proceed with their claim for the additional £8,000.

   Consequences:
   - The agreement or consent order may be set aside or deemed voidable

   Exceptions:
   - The party had independent legal advice
   - The agreement was made after negotiations between the parties with each having the benefit of independent legal advice
   - The terms of the agreement do not appear to be so unjust as to suggest duress

### Minor Premise:

1. Malcolm Ernest Gray v Diane Cary Barber Servino:
   - Pyrotechnics Ltd claims that the agreement to accept £40,000 in full and final settlement was made under duress.
   - The alleged duress includes economic pressure, as Pyrotechnics Ltd was being pressed by their own creditors.
   - This economic pressure caused Pyrotechnics Ltd to agree to the settlement.
   - Pyrotechnics Ltd did not have a reasonable alternative but to agree, given their financial situation.

   Exceptions:
   - There is no indication that Pyrotechnics Ltd had independent legal advice.
   - The agreement was not made after negotiations with each party having the benefit of independent legal advice.
   - The terms of the agreement (accepting £40,000 instead of £48,000) appear to be unjust, suggesting duress.

### Conclusion:

The conditions for setting aside the agreement under duress are satisfied, and none of the exceptions apply. Therefore, Pyrotechnics Ltd can bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (RE DAI YUMIN [2022] HKCFI 950; HCB 7582/2020)
In the case of RE DAI YUMIN [2022] HKCFI 950; HCB 7582/2020 (precedent p), the court ruled that a party cannot be accused of failing to mitigate its loss if it chooses to enforce its contractual rights rather than accepting a repudiation and mitigating the loss. The court also emphasized that a party may enforce its contractual rights as it sees fit, whether in a reasonable or unreasonable way, unless it is using those rights to penalize the other party when an equally advantageous alternative is available.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in RE DAI YUMIN and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Repudiation and Acceptance**: In RE DAI YUMIN, the court discussed the options available to a party when the other party repudiates a contract. Similarly, in our current case, Gabrielle and Zolt's actions can be seen as a form of repudiation of the original contract terms.
- **Mitigation of Loss**: In RE DAI YUMIN, the court addressed the issue of whether the plaintiff failed to mitigate its loss. In our current case, Gabrielle argues that the additional £5,000 for the drains should be absorbed by Pyrotechnics Ltd, implying a failure to mitigate.
- **Economic Duress**: In RE DAI YUMIN, the court examined the concept of economic duress and whether the pressure applied was legitimate or illegitimate. In our current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd agreed to accept £40,000 in full and final settlement under financial pressure from their own creditors, which could be seen as economic duress.
- **Enforcement of Contractual Rights**: In RE DAI YUMIN, the court upheld the principle that a party may enforce its contractual rights as it sees fit. In our current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd seeks to enforce its right to the additional £5,000 and the £3,000 bonus.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (RE DAI YUMIN)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern involving repudiation, mitigation of loss, and economic duress, the court should decide in favor of allowing the enforcement of contractual rights. This rule was justified in RE DAI YUMIN because the positive effects (E+) of upholding contractual rights and ensuring that parties cannot escape their obligations through economic duress outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially harsh outcomes for the party under financial pressure.

Applying this rule to our current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd should be able to bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000. The agreement to accept £40,000 in full and final settlement was made under economic duress, and Pyrotechnics Ltd should be entitled to enforce its original contractual rights.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (RE DAI YUMIN [2022] HKCFI 950; HCB 7582/2020) are present:

- **Repudiation and Acceptance**: In RE DAI YUMIN, the court discussed the options available to a party when the other party repudiates a contract. Similarly, in our current case, Gabrielle and Zolt's actions can be seen as a form of repudiation of the original contract terms by refusing to pay the additional £5,000 and the £3,000 bonus.
- **Mitigation of Loss**: In RE DAI YUMIN, the court addressed the issue of whether the plaintiff failed to mitigate its loss. In our current case, Gabrielle argues that the additional £5,000 for the drains should be absorbed by Pyrotechnics Ltd, implying a failure to mitigate. However, Pyrotechnics Ltd had already rescheduled other work and paid their staff overtime to meet the original deadline, indicating they took steps to mitigate any potential delays.
- **Economic Duress**: In RE DAI YUMIN, the court examined the concept of economic duress and whether the pressure applied was legitimate or illegitimate. In our current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd agreed to accept £40,000 in full and final settlement under financial pressure from their own creditors, which could be seen as economic duress.
- **Enforcement of Contractual Rights**: In RE DAI YUMIN, the court upheld the principle that a party may enforce its contractual rights as it sees fit. In our current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd seeks to enforce its right to the additional £5,000 and the £3,000 bonus.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in RE DAI YUMIN. This decision would be justified because, as in RE DAI YUMIN, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Contractual Obligations**: Enforcing the original contractual terms ensures that parties cannot escape their obligations through economic duress or financial pressure. This promotes fairness and reliability in commercial transactions.
2. **Deterring Unfair Practices**: Allowing Pyrotechnics Ltd to recover the additional £5,000 and the £3,000 bonus deters parties from using financial pressure to renegotiate terms unfairly after the fact.
3. **Encouraging Good Faith Negotiations**: By upholding the original contract, the court encourages parties to negotiate in good faith and to honor their commitments, knowing that they cannot later evade their responsibilities through economic duress.
4. **Promoting Legal Certainty**: Consistent application of legal principles provides certainty and predictability in the law, which is essential for the smooth functioning of commercial activities.

Therefore, Pyrotechnics Ltd should be able to bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000. The agreement to accept £40,000 in full and final settlement was made under economic duress, and Pyrotechnics Ltd should be entitled to enforce its original contractual rights.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case RE DAI YUMIN [2022] HKCFI 950; HCB 7582/2020, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of a clear repudiation and acceptance of the contract terms. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—upholding contractual obligations and deterring unfair practices—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided a clear legal framework for assessing the parties' actions and responsibilities. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of a clear repudiation and acceptance is notably absent. Gabrielle and Zolt did not explicitly repudiate the contract; instead, they attempted to renegotiate the terms under financial pressure, which complicates the assessment of whether there was a clear acceptance of the repudiation by Pyrotechnics Ltd.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor of economic duress that was not present in RE DAI YUMIN. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because economic duress involves the application of illegitimate pressure to force a party into accepting terms they would not have otherwise agreed to. Due to the presence of economic duress, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as undermining the fairness and voluntariness of contractual agreements, than positive ones. Unlike in RE DAI YUMIN, where the parties' actions were within the bounds of enforcing contractual rights, the economic duress in our case suggests that Pyrotechnics Ltd's agreement to accept £40,000 in full and final settlement was not made freely and voluntarily, thereby justifying a different legal outcome.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from RE DAI YUMIN [2022] HKCFI 950; HCB 7582/2020 should be stated as 'When both [the shared fact pattern of repudiation, mitigation of loss, and enforcement of contractual rights] and [the presence of economic duress] are present, the court should decide [to allow the enforcement of the original contractual rights].' Omitting [the presence of economic duress] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of parties being forced into unfair settlements under financial pressure, thereby undermining the fairness and voluntariness of contractual agreements]. Indeed, the opinion in RE DAI YUMIN explicitly states that the court must be careful in distinguishing aggressive (yet legitimate) commercial activities from “illegitimate pressure” involving unconscionable or unlawful conduct, highlighting the relevance of economic duress to their decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in RE DAI YUMIN was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties being forced into unfair settlements under financial pressure, thereby undermining the fairness and voluntariness of contractual agreements]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [parties being forced into unfair settlements under financial pressure] occurring if the court allows Pyrotechnics Ltd to enforce its original contractual rights. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the clear repudiation and acceptance of the contract terms, which was present in the precedent case RE DAI YUMIN [2022] HKCFI 950; HCB 7582/2020, requiring this factor for all similar cases of economic duress and enforcement of contractual rights would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would allow parties to exploit financial pressure to renegotiate terms unfairly, thereby undermining the fairness and voluntariness of contractual agreements. Conversely, not requiring a clear repudiation and acceptance would allow for the enforcement of original contractual rights even in the presence of economic duress, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, such as fairness, good faith, and the integrity of contractual obligations.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the clear repudiation and acceptance of the contract terms, which was present in RE DAI YUMIN, we have the additional factor of economic duress. This economic duress, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of repudiation, mitigation of loss, and enforcement of contractual rights, serves a similar function to the clear repudiation and acceptance in the precedent case. Given the presence of economic duress, we submit that the reasoning in RE DAI YUMIN still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values—such as upholding contractual obligations, deterring unfair practices, and promoting good faith negotiations—would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to RE DAI YUMIN [2022] HKCFI 950; HCB 7582/2020, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the issues of repudiation, mitigation of loss, and enforcement of contractual rights. However, it also differs significantly in the presence of economic duress, which was not a factor in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule from RE DAI YUMIN, which allows for the enforcement of contractual rights even in the face of repudiation and failure to mitigate, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the economic duress present in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that economic duress undermines the fairness and voluntariness of contractual agreements (Step 6) and the counterpoint that enforcing the original contractual rights promotes legal certainty and deters unfair practices (Step 4).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, good faith, and the integrity of contractual obligations, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Pyrotechnics Ltd should be able to bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000. The agreement to accept £40,000 in full and final settlement was made under economic duress, and Pyrotechnics Ltd should be entitled to enforce its original contractual rights.

This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by ensuring that parties cannot exploit financial pressure to renegotiate terms unfairly. The key factors influencing this outcome include the presence of economic duress, the steps taken by Pyrotechnics Ltd to mitigate potential delays, and the importance of upholding contractual obligations to promote fairness and good faith in commercial transactions.


# Contract Law: Whether the additional work on the drains was impliedly included in the original £80,000 quote

## Deductive Reasoning: cfi

### Relevant law:

E. Bon Building Materials Company Limited v Walland Enterprises Limited

WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD [2024] HKCFI 45

### Major Premise:

1. E. Bon Building Materials Company Limited v Walland Enterprises Limited

   Conditions:
   - There is an existing contract between the parties to pay an agreed sum.
   - The work is included in the original contract sum.

   Consequences:
   - The defendant must carry it out and cannot recover extra payment for it.

   Exceptions:
   - The work is outside the contract.

2. WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD [2024] HKCFI 45

   Conditions:
   - The contract is a lump-sum contract with works widely defined.
   - The contractor must complete a whole work for a lump sum.
   - The courts infer a promise on the contractor's part to provide everything indispensably necessary to complete the whole work.

   Consequences:
   - Such necessary works are not extras, for they are impliedly included in the lump sum.

   Exceptions:
   - The work is expressly or impliedly included in the work for which the lump sum is payable.

### Minor Premise:

1. E. Bon Building Materials Company Limited v Walland Enterprises Limited:
- There is an existing contract between Gabrielle and Zolt and Pyrotechnics Ltd to pay an agreed sum of £80,000.
- The work on the drains was not explicitly included in the original contract sum.
- The work on the drains was necessary to comply with current building regulations, which may imply it was outside the original scope of the contract.

2. WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD [2024] HKCFI 45:
- The contract between Gabrielle and Zolt and Pyrotechnics Ltd is a lump-sum contract with works widely defined.
- Pyrotechnics Ltd must complete the refurbishment of Gabrizo for a lump sum of £80,000.
- The courts would likely infer a promise on Pyrotechnics Ltd's part to provide everything indispensably necessary to complete the refurbishment, including compliance with building regulations.
- The necessary work on the drains to comply with building regulations is not considered an extra, as it is impliedly included in the lump sum.

### Conclusion:

Based on the relevant case law, the work on the drains is impliedly included in the original lump-sum contract of £80,000. Therefore, Pyrotechnics Ltd cannot recover the additional £5,000 for the work on the drains. However, the promise of a £3,000 bonus for completing the work on schedule is a separate agreement and can be pursued. Pyrotechnics Ltd can bring an action to recover the £3,000 bonus but not the £5,000 for the drains.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD)

In the case of WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD [2024] HKCFI 45; HCCT 57/2020 (precedent p), the court ruled that the Excepted List was part of the original Tender, Letter of Award, Contractor Agreement, and Varied Contractor Agreement (VCA). The court found that the additional works were not impliedly included in the lump sum contract and that the contractor was entitled to additional payment for those works.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Contractual Interpretation**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In both cases, there was a dispute over whether certain works were included in the original contract sum. In WAH SUNG, the dispute was over the Excepted List, while in our current case, the dispute is over the additional work on the drains.

- **Legal Concept 2: Lump Sum Contracts**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** Both cases involve lump sum contracts where the scope of work was defined. In WAH SUNG, the contract sum was defined with reference to the Tender and the Initial Approved Plans. In our current case, the contract sum was defined as £80,000 for the refurbishment project.

- **Legal Concept 3: Additional Works**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In both cases, additional works were required that were not initially anticipated. In WAH SUNG, additional works were identified through the Excepted List. In our current case, the additional work involved relocating the drains.

- **Legal Concept 4: Payment for Additional Works**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** Both cases involve a dispute over payment for additional works. In WAH SUNG, the contractor sought payment for additional works not included in the lump sum. In our current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd seeks payment for the additional £5,000 for the drain work and the £3,000 bonus.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern where additional works are required that were not included in the original contract sum, the court should decide that the contractor is entitled to additional payment for those works. This rule was justified in WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD because the court found that the additional works were not impliedly included in the lump sum contract, and the contractor had a reasonable expectation of being paid for those additional works. The positive effects (E+) of this outcome on the underlying values and principles of the law, such as fairness and the protection of contractors' rights to be compensated for unforeseen additional work, outweigh the negative effects (E-) in that case.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Contractual Interpretation**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In both cases, there was a dispute over whether certain works were included in the original contract sum. In WAH SUNG, the dispute was over the Excepted List, while in our current case, the dispute is over the additional work on the drains.

- **Legal Concept 2: Lump Sum Contracts**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** Both cases involve lump sum contracts where the scope of work was defined. In WAH SUNG, the contract sum was defined with reference to the Tender and the Initial Approved Plans. In our current case, the contract sum was defined as £80,000 for the refurbishment project.

- **Legal Concept 3: Additional Works**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In both cases, additional works were required that were not initially anticipated. In WAH SUNG, additional works were identified through the Excepted List. In our current case, the additional work involved relocating the drains.

- **Legal Concept 4: Payment for Additional Works**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** Both cases involve a dispute over payment for additional works. In WAH SUNG, the contractor sought payment for additional works not included in the lump sum. In our current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd seeks payment for the additional £5,000 for the drain work and the £3,000 bonus.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Fairness and Equity:** Ensuring that contractors are compensated for unforeseen additional work promotes fairness and equity in contractual relationships. It prevents one party from unfairly bearing the burden of additional costs that were not anticipated at the time of the contract.

2. **Protection of Contractors' Rights:** Recognizing the right of contractors to be paid for additional work protects their financial interests and ensures that they are not left out of pocket for work that was necessary but not included in the original contract.

3. **Encouragement of Good Faith Negotiations:** Upholding the principle that additional works should be compensated encourages parties to negotiate in good faith and to clearly define the scope of work and any potential additional costs at the outset of a project.

4. **Commercial Common Sense:** It aligns with commercial common sense to expect that additional, unforeseen work should be compensated separately from the original contract sum. This approach reflects the realities of construction and refurbishment projects, where unexpected issues often arise.

Therefore, Pyrotechnics Ltd should be entitled to recover the £5,000 for the additional work on the drains and the £3,000 bonus for completing the project on time. This outcome aligns with the principles established in the precedent case and supports the underlying values of fairness, protection of contractors' rights, and commercial common sense.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, namely the explicit promise of a bonus for timely completion, that was not present in WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of additional works and payment disputes.

In WAH SUNG, the dispute centered around whether the additional works were impliedly included in the original contract sum. The court found that they were not, and thus the contractor was entitled to additional payment. However, in our current case, the promise of a £3,000 bonus for timely completion introduces a new element of contractual obligation that was explicitly agreed upon by both parties.

Because of this explicit promise, applying the same outcome (i.e., that additional works are not impliedly included in the original contract sum) in our case would have more positive consequences, such as upholding the integrity of explicit contractual promises and encouraging good faith negotiations. This is unlike in WAH SUNG, where the focus was on implied terms and the inclusion of additional works in a lump sum contract. Therefore, Pyrotechnics Ltd should be entitled to recover both the £5,000 for the additional work on the drains and the £3,000 bonus for completing the project on time.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD should be stated as: "When both the fact pattern of additional works not included in the original contract sum (i*) and an explicit promise of a bonus for timely completion (m) are present, the court should decide that the contractor is entitled to additional payment for those works and the bonus (o)." Omitting the explicit promise of a bonus (m) from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence (q) of undermining the integrity of explicit contractual promises and discouraging good faith negotiations. Indeed, the opinion in WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD implicitly emphasizes the importance of clear contractual terms and the reasonable expectations of the parties, which would be compromised if explicit promises were not upheld.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence (u) of contractors being unfairly denied payment for additional works that were not included in the original contract sum. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence (u) occurring because the additional work on the drains and the bonus for timely completion were explicitly agreed upon by both parties. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—to ensure contractors are compensated for unforeseen additional work—is not relevant to our situation where the additional work and bonus were explicitly negotiated and agreed upon.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the explicit inclusion of an Excepted List, which was present in the precedent case WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD, requiring this factor for all similar cases of additional works not included in the original contract sum would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would undermine the principle that contractors should be compensated for unforeseen additional work, even when such work is not explicitly listed in the contract. Conversely, not requiring the explicit inclusion of an Excepted List would allow for a more flexible and fair approach, ensuring that contractors are compensated for necessary additional work that arises during the course of a project. This better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness, equity, and commercial common sense in contract law.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the explicit inclusion of an Excepted List, which was present in WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD, we have the additional factor of an explicit promise of a bonus for timely completion. This explicit promise, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of additional works not included in the original contract sum, serves a similar function to the Excepted List in the precedent case. Given the presence of this explicit promise, we submit that the reasoning in WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values—such as upholding the integrity of explicit contractual promises, encouraging good faith negotiations, and ensuring fairness and equity—would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of additional works not included in the original contract sum and the dispute over payment for these additional works. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the explicit promise of a bonus for timely completion in the current case, which was not present in the precedent.

The proposed legal rule that contractors are entitled to additional payment for unforeseen additional works finds support in both cases. However, the broader implications of this rule must be considered, especially in light of the explicit promise of a bonus in the current case. This promise introduces a new element of contractual obligation that was explicitly agreed upon by both parties, which was not a factor in the precedent case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point from the precedent that additional works not included in the original contract sum should be compensated, and the counterargument that the explicit promise of a bonus for timely completion should be upheld to maintain the integrity of contractual promises.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, protection of contractors' rights, and commercial common sense, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Pyrotechnics Ltd should be entitled to recover both the £5,000 for the additional work on the drains and the £3,000 bonus for completing the project on time. This decision aligns with the principles established in the precedent case and supports the underlying values of fairness, protection of contractors' rights, and commercial common sense, while also upholding the integrity of explicit contractual promises.


# Contract Law: Whether Pyrotechnics Ltd can claim the £5,000 for the additional work on the drains as a separate contractual obligation

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 6 and Section 11 Subsection 2 and 4

### Major Premise:

1. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 6

   Conditions:
   - A third party may enforce a term of a contract under section 4.
   - The parties to the contract may not, without the third party’s consent, rescind or vary the contract so that the third party’s right under the term is altered or extinguished.
   - The third party has assented to the term and the promisor has received notice of the assent.
   - The third party has relied on the term and the promisor is aware of the reliance or can reasonably be expected to have foreseen that the third party would rely on the term.

   Consequences:
   - The parties to the contract may not rescind or vary the contract without the third party’s consent.

   Exceptions:
   - An express term of the contract provides that one or more parties to the contract may rescind or vary the contract without the third party’s consent.
   - The third party’s consent to rescind or vary the contract is required in circumstances specified in the contract instead of those set out in subsection (2)(a) and (b).
   - The third party is aware of the term referred to in subsection (3).
   - One or more parties to the contract have taken reasonable steps to make the third party aware of the term.

2. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 11 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - A third party may enforce a term of a contract under section 4.
   - The promisor has wholly or partly performed the promisor’s obligations to the third party under the term.

   Consequences:
   - The promisor is discharged from the obligations owed by the promisor to the promisee to the extent of having performed the same obligations to the third party.

   Exceptions:
   - None.

3. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 11 Subsection 4

   Conditions:
   - A third party may enforce a term of a contract under section 4.
   - The promisee has recovered from the promisor a sum for the third party’s loss in relation to the term.
   - The promisee has recovered from the promisor a sum for the expense to the promisee of making good to the third party the default of the promisor in relation to the term.

   Consequences:
   - In any proceedings brought under section 4 before a court or arbitral tribunal by the third party, the court or arbitral tribunal must reduce any award to the third party to the extent to which it thinks appropriate to take account of the sum.

   Exceptions:
   - None.

### Minor Premise:

1. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 6:
- Pyrotechnics Ltd is not a third party to the contract between Gabrielle and Zolt, but rather the promisor.
- Therefore, this section does not apply.

2. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 11 Subsection 2:
- Pyrotechnics Ltd has performed additional work on the drains and completed the project on time, which can be seen as performing their obligations.
- However, the additional work and the bonus were not part of the original contract but were additional agreements.
- Therefore, this section does not apply.

3. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 11 Subsection 4:
- Gabrielle and Zolt have not recovered any sum from Pyrotechnics Ltd for the third party’s loss or expense.
- Therefore, this section does not apply.

### Conclusion:

The Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 does not apply to the scenario as Pyrotechnics Ltd is not a third party but the promisor. Pyrotechnics Ltd can bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the additional work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000 based on the principles of contract law, as these were additional agreements made during the course of the project.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD)

In the case of WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD [2024] HKCFI 45; HCCT 57/2020 (precedent p), Wah Sung Construction & Piling Ltd (Wah Sung) was engaged by Cheerwide Ltd (Cheerwide) to perform certain construction works. During the project, additional works were instructed by the architect, Alliance, which were outside the original contract scope. Wah Sung claimed additional payment for these works. The court ruled that Wah Sung was entitled to payment for the additional works as they were outside the scope of the original contract and constituted supplemental agreements. The court also recognized the prevention principle, which states that an employer cannot insist on performance of an obligation it has prevented the contractor from performing.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Additional Works Outside Original Contract Scope**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In WAH SUNG, additional works were instructed that were outside the original contract scope, and Wah Sung was entitled to additional payment. In our current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd was instructed to relocate the drains, which was not part of the original contract scope.

- **Legal Concept 2: Supplemental Agreements**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In WAH SUNG, the additional works were treated as supplemental agreements. In our current case, the agreement to pay an additional £5,000 for the drain relocation can be seen as a supplemental agreement.

- **Legal Concept 3: Prevention Principle**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In WAH SUNG, the court recognized that the employer's actions (e.g., ordering additional works) could prevent the contractor from completing the original works on time. In our current case, Gabrielle and Zolt's insistence on opening on time and offering a bonus for timely completion can be seen as an act that prevented Pyrotechnics Ltd from adhering strictly to the original timeline.

- **Legal Concept 4: Entitlement to Reasonable Remuneration**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In WAH SUNG, Wah Sung was entitled to reasonable remuneration for the additional works. In our current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd should be entitled to reasonable remuneration for the additional £5,000 for the drain relocation and the £3,000 bonus for timely completion.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of additional works being instructed outside the original contract scope, the court should decide that the contractor is entitled to additional payment for those works. This rule was justified in WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD because the positive effects of ensuring contractors are fairly compensated for additional work and preventing employers from unfairly benefiting from such work outweigh any negative effects. This rule upholds the principles of fairness and reasonable remuneration in contract law.

Therefore, applying this rule to our current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd should be entitled to recover the £5,000 for the additional work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000, as these were supplemental agreements outside the original contract scope and were necessary to meet the employer's requirements.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Additional Works Outside Original Contract Scope**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In WAH SUNG, additional works were instructed that were outside the original contract scope, and Wah Sung was entitled to additional payment. In our current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd was instructed to relocate the drains, which was not part of the original contract scope.

- **Legal Concept 2: Supplemental Agreements**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In WAH SUNG, the additional works were treated as supplemental agreements. In our current case, the agreement to pay an additional £5,000 for the drain relocation can be seen as a supplemental agreement.

- **Legal Concept 3: Prevention Principle**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In WAH SUNG, the court recognized that the employer's actions (e.g., ordering additional works) could prevent the contractor from completing the original works on time. In our current case, Gabrielle and Zolt's insistence on opening on time and offering a bonus for timely completion can be seen as an act that prevented Pyrotechnics Ltd from adhering strictly to the original timeline.

- **Legal Concept 4: Entitlement to Reasonable Remuneration**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In WAH SUNG, Wah Sung was entitled to reasonable remuneration for the additional works. In our current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd should be entitled to reasonable remuneration for the additional £5,000 for the drain relocation and the £3,000 bonus for timely completion.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Fair Compensation**: Ensuring that Pyrotechnics Ltd is fairly compensated for the additional work and the efforts to meet the revised timeline upholds the principle of fairness in contractual dealings.
2. **Encouraging Compliance**: It encourages contractors to comply with additional requests and changes during a project, knowing they will be compensated for their efforts.
3. **Preventing Unjust Enrichment**: It prevents Gabrielle and Zolt from unjustly benefiting from the additional work and timely completion without paying the agreed-upon compensation.
4. **Maintaining Contractual Integrity**: It reinforces the importance of honoring supplemental agreements and the obligations that arise from them.

Therefore, Pyrotechnics Ltd should be entitled to recover the £5,000 for the additional work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000, as these were supplemental agreements outside the original contract scope and were necessary to meet the employer's requirements.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the agreement to accept £40,000 in full and final settlement, that was not present in WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of additional works outside the original contract scope. Due to this settlement agreement, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the finality of settlements and creating uncertainty in contractual agreements than positive ones, unlike in WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD. The settlement agreement indicates that Pyrotechnics Ltd agreed to waive any further claims in exchange for immediate payment, which changes the legal landscape and the expectations of the parties involved.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD should be stated as "When both [additional works outside the original contract scope] and [an agreement to accept a sum in full and final settlement] are present, the court should decide that the contractor is not entitled to further claims." Omitting [an agreement to accept a sum in full and final settlement] from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of undermining the finality of settlements and creating uncertainty in contractual agreements. Indeed, the opinion in WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD explicitly states that the absence of a settlement agreement was crucial to their decision, as the court focused on the entitlement to reasonable remuneration for additional works without any mention of a final settlement agreement.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of contractors not being fairly compensated for additional works outside the original contract scope. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because Pyrotechnics Ltd agreed to accept £40,000 in full and final settlement of the debt. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—ensuring fair compensation for additional works—is not relevant to our situation where a final settlement agreement was made.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the explicit absence of a settlement agreement, which was present in the precedent case WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD, requiring this factor for all similar cases of additional works outside the original contract scope would lead to the undesirable consequence of undermining the finality of settlements and creating uncertainty in contractual agreements. Conversely, not requiring the absence of a settlement agreement would allow for the desirable outcome of ensuring that contractors are fairly compensated for additional works, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and reasonable remuneration in contract law. This approach would also prevent employers from unjustly benefiting from additional works without paying the agreed-upon compensation.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the explicit absence of a settlement agreement, which was present in WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD, we have the additional factor of the agreement to accept £40,000 in full and final settlement. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of additional works outside the original contract scope, serves a similar function to the absence of a settlement agreement in the precedent case. Given the presence of the full and final settlement agreement, we submit that the reasoning in WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD still applies, as the positive effects on ensuring fair compensation and maintaining contractual integrity would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. Therefore, Pyrotechnics Ltd should be entitled to recover the £5,000 for the additional work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000, as these were supplemental agreements outside the original contract scope and were necessary to meet the employer's requirements.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in the context of additional works being instructed outside the original contract scope and the entitlement to reasonable remuneration for such works. However, it also differs significantly due to the presence of a full and final settlement agreement in the current case, which was not present in the precedent.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case—that contractors are entitled to additional payment for works outside the original contract scope—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the settlement agreement in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the settlement agreement should be honored to maintain the finality of settlements and prevent uncertainty in contractual agreements. Conversely, the argument for ensuring fair compensation for additional works and preventing unjust enrichment also holds significant weight.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, reasonable remuneration, and the importance of upholding settlement agreements, we conclude that Pyrotechnics Ltd should not be entitled to recover the £5,000 for the additional work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000. The presence of the full and final settlement agreement indicates that Pyrotechnics Ltd agreed to waive any further claims in exchange for immediate payment, which changes the legal landscape and the expectations of the parties involved.

Therefore, the decision is reached that the settlement agreement should be honored, and Pyrotechnics Ltd cannot bring an action to recover the additional £5,000 and the £3,000 bonus. This conclusion aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by upholding the finality of settlements and preventing uncertainty in contractual agreements.

### Minor Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 51 Subsection 1:
   - Pyrotechnics Ltd and Gabrielle (and Zolt) entered into a contract for refurbishment services, not a sale of goods.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 51 Subsection 2:
   - The contract between Pyrotechnics Ltd and Gabrielle (and Zolt) is for services, not for the sale of goods.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

   - Therefore, this section applies.

### Conclusion:

Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3 applies. Pyrotechnics Ltd can bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000, as these amounts represent the valuable benefits obtained by Gabrielle and Zolt due to the additional work and timely completion of the refurbishment.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (CHINNEY SHUN CHEONG BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING LTD v. JIM CHI WING AND OTHERS)

In the case of CHINNEY SHUN CHEONG BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING LTD (FORMERLY KNOWN AS CHINNEY E & M (MAINTENANCE) LTD) v. JIM CHI WING AND OTHERS [2022] HKCFI 2711; HCA 824/2020 (13 September 2022) (precedent p), the court ruled that the Plaintiff was entitled to recover damages for the additional costs incurred due to the Defendants' repudiatory breach of contract. The Plaintiff was able to recover the costs of completing the work by another contractor, the advanced payments made to the Defendants, and the direct payments made to the workers, as well as the fines incurred due to the Defendants' breaches of safety rules.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in CHINNEY SHUN CHEONG BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING LTD v. JIM CHI WING AND OTHERS and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Repudiatory Breach of Contract**: In both cases, the Defendants failed to complete the work as agreed, leading to a repudiatory breach of contract.
  - **Fact Pattern**: The Defendants abandoned the work sites, and the Plaintiffs had to engage another contractor to complete the work.
  
- **Additional Costs Incurred**: The Plaintiffs in both cases incurred additional costs due to the Defendants' failure to complete the work.
  - **Fact Pattern**: The Plaintiffs had to pay another contractor to complete the work and incurred additional costs for rectification and completion.

- **Advanced Payments**: In both cases, the Plaintiffs made advanced payments to the Defendants to assist with cash flow issues.
  - **Fact Pattern**: The Plaintiffs made payments to the Defendants to cover wages and other expenses, which were not refunded when the Defendants abandoned the work.

- **Direct Payments to Workers**: In both cases, the Plaintiffs made direct payments to the workers after the Defendants abandoned the work.
  - **Fact Pattern**: The Plaintiffs paid the workers directly to cover outstanding wages and other obligations.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (CHINNEY SHUN CHEONG BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING LTD v. JIM CHI WING AND OTHERS)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a repudiatory breach of contract, where the Defendants abandon the work and the Plaintiffs incur additional costs to complete the work, the court should decide that the Plaintiffs are entitled to recover those additional costs. This rule was justified in CHINNEY SHUN CHEONG BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING LTD v. JIM CHI WING AND OTHERS because the positive effects of allowing the Plaintiffs to recover their additional costs (E+) on the underlying values and principles of the law, such as fairness and the enforcement of contractual obligations, outweigh the negative effects (E-) in that case.

Applying this rule to the current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd can bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the additional work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000. The fact pattern of a repudiatory breach and additional costs incurred is present, and the legal principles established in the precedent case support the recovery of these amounts.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (CHINNEY SHUN CHEONG BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING LTD v. JIM CHI WING AND OTHERS) are present:

- **Repudiatory Breach of Contract**: In both cases, the Defendants failed to fulfill their contractual obligations, leading to a repudiatory breach of contract.
  - **Fact Pattern**: Gabrielle and Zolt failed to pay the additional £5,000 for the drain work and the £3,000 bonus despite Pyrotechnics Ltd completing the work on time.

- **Additional Costs Incurred**: The Plaintiffs in both cases incurred additional costs due to the Defendants' failure to honor the contract.
  - **Fact Pattern**: Pyrotechnics Ltd incurred additional costs by rescheduling other work and paying their staff overtime to ensure the project was completed on time.

- **Advanced Payments**: In both cases, the Plaintiffs made payments to the Defendants to assist with cash flow issues.
  - **Fact Pattern**: Gabrielle and Zolt paid a deposit of £40,000, which can be seen as an advance payment towards the total project cost.

- **Direct Payments to Workers**: Although not directly applicable in the current case, the principle of making payments to fulfill contractual obligations is relevant.
  - **Fact Pattern**: Pyrotechnics Ltd paid their staff overtime to meet the project deadline, similar to making direct payments to workers in the precedent case.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in CHINNEY SHUN CHEONG BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING LTD v. JIM CHI WING AND OTHERS. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Fairness and Justice**: Allowing Pyrotechnics Ltd to recover the additional £5,000 and the £3,000 bonus would ensure that they are not unfairly burdened by the additional costs incurred due to the Defendants' failure to honor their contractual obligations.

2. **Enforcement of Contractual Obligations**: Upholding the claim would reinforce the principle that parties must adhere to their contractual commitments, thereby promoting reliability and trust in commercial transactions.

3. **Deterrence of Breach**: By allowing recovery of the additional costs, the court would deter parties from breaching contracts and abandoning their obligations, knowing that they would be held accountable for the financial consequences.

4. **Mitigation of Damages**: The decision would support the principle that parties who take reasonable steps to mitigate their damages, as Pyrotechnics Ltd did by rescheduling work and paying overtime, should be compensated for their efforts.

Therefore, given the shared fact patterns and the positive effects on the underlying values and principles of the law, the court should allow Pyrotechnics Ltd to recover the £5,000 for the additional work on the drains and the £3,000 bonus for completing the work on time.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor of **"agreement under duress"** that was not present in **CHINNEY SHUN CHEONG BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING LTD v. JIM CHI WING AND OTHERS**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of repudiatory breach and additional costs incurred.

In the precedent case, the Defendants' abandonment of the work sites and the subsequent costs incurred by the Plaintiff were clear-cut instances of repudiatory breach, and the Plaintiff was entitled to recover those costs. However, in our current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd agreed to accept £40,000 in full and final settlement under duress, as they were being pressed by their own creditors. This agreement under duress significantly impacts the enforceability of the original contract terms and the subsequent claims for additional costs and bonuses.

Due to the presence of **"agreement under duress"**, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the principle of voluntary and consensual agreements in contract law. Unlike in **CHINNEY SHUN CHEONG BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING LTD v. JIM CHI WING AND OTHERS**, where the Plaintiff's claims were straightforward and supported by clear evidence of additional costs incurred due to the Defendants' breach, our case involves a settlement agreement that was not entered into freely. This significantly complicates the matter and suggests that the court may need to consider the validity of the settlement agreement before addressing the claims for additional costs and bonuses.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from **CHINNEY SHUN CHEONG BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING LTD v. JIM CHI WING AND OTHERS** should be stated as: "When both [repudiatory breach of contract leading to additional costs incurred] and [agreement under duress] are present, the court should decide [that the Plaintiff is entitled to recover the additional costs and any promised bonuses]." Omitting [agreement under duress] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of enforcing settlements that were not entered into freely and voluntarily, thereby undermining the principle of consensual agreements in contract law]. Indeed, the opinion in **CHINNEY SHUN CHEONG BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING LTD v. JIM CHI WING AND OTHERS** implicitly supports the importance of voluntary agreements by focusing on clear evidence of additional costs incurred due to the Defendants' breach, without the complicating factor of duress.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in **CHINNEY SHUN CHEONG BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING LTD v. JIM CHI WING AND OTHERS** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of Plaintiffs being unable to recover additional costs incurred due to Defendants' repudiatory breach of contract]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [Plaintiffs being unable to recover additional costs due to a straightforward repudiatory breach]. Instead, the risk is that [enforcing a settlement agreement made under duress would undermine the principle of voluntary and consensual agreements in contract law]. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The court should instead focus on the validity of the settlement agreement and whether it was entered into freely and voluntarily before addressing the claims for additional costs and bonuses.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of "repudiatory breach of contract" which was present in the precedent case **CHINNEY SHUN CHEONG BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING LTD v. JIM CHI WING AND OTHERS**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of "additional costs incurred due to contractual obligations" would lead to the undesirable consequence of allowing parties to escape their financial obligations simply by negotiating under duress. Conversely, not requiring "repudiatory breach of contract" would allow for the desirable outcome of ensuring that parties who have incurred additional costs due to fulfilling their contractual obligations are compensated fairly, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and justice in contract law.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of "repudiatory breach of contract," which was present in **CHINNEY SHUN CHEONG BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING LTD v. JIM CHI WING AND OTHERS**, we have the additional factor of "agreement under duress." This "agreement under duress," when considered alongside the shared circumstances of "additional costs incurred due to contractual obligations," serves a similar function to "repudiatory breach of contract" in the precedent case. Given the presence of "agreement under duress," we submit that the reasoning in **CHINNEY SHUN CHEONG BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING LTD v. JIM CHI WING AND OTHERS** still applies, as the positive effects on the relevant legal values of fairness, justice, and the enforcement of contractual obligations would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **CHINNEY SHUN CHEONG BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING LTD v. JIM CHI WING AND OTHERS**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations:

1. **Key Similarities**:
   - Both cases involve a repudiatory breach of contract where the Defendants failed to fulfill their contractual obligations, leading to additional costs incurred by the Plaintiffs.
   - Both cases involve the Plaintiffs making advanced payments and direct payments to workers to mitigate the impact of the Defendants' breach.
   - Both cases involve the Plaintiffs engaging alternative contractors to complete the outstanding work and rectify defects.

2. **Key Differences**:
   - In the current case, there is an element of "agreement under duress" where Pyrotechnics Ltd agreed to accept £40,000 in full and final settlement due to financial pressure from their own creditors.
   - The precedent case did not involve any settlement agreement under duress, making the claims for additional costs and damages more straightforward.

3. **Proposed Legal Rule**:
   - The rule from the precedent case suggests that Plaintiffs are entitled to recover additional costs incurred due to the Defendants' repudiatory breach of contract. However, the current case introduces the complicating factor of an agreement under duress.

4. **Weighing Arguments**:
   - **For Pyrotechnics Ltd**: The argument that they should be able to recover the additional £5,000 and the £3,000 bonus is supported by the principle of fairness and the enforcement of contractual obligations. The precedent case supports the recovery of additional costs incurred due to the Defendants' breach.
   - **Against Pyrotechnics Ltd**: The agreement under duress complicates the matter, as enforcing such a settlement could undermine the principle of voluntary and consensual agreements in contract law. The court must consider the validity of the settlement agreement before addressing the claims for additional costs and bonuses.

5. **Legal Principles**:
   - The principles of fairness, justice, and the enforcement of contractual obligations are crucial. However, the principle of voluntary and consensual agreements in contract law must also be upheld.

### Final Decision

Considering the underlying legal principles and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Pyrotechnics Ltd should be able to bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the additional work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000. However, the court must first address the validity of the settlement agreement made under duress. If the court finds that the agreement was not entered into freely and voluntarily, Pyrotechnics Ltd should be entitled to recover the additional costs and the bonus. This decision aligns with the legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by ensuring that agreements made under duress are not enforced, thereby upholding the principle of voluntary and consensual agreements in contract law.

3. Gabrielle and Zolt obtained a real benefit as the work was completed on time, allowing Gabrizo to open as scheduled.
4. There is no indication that the promise of the additional payment for the drain work was given as a result of economic duress or fraud.

### Conclusion:

The variation of the contract terms to include the additional £5,000 for the drain work is supported by consideration. Pyrotechnics Ltd can bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains.

### Final Conclusion:

Pyrotechnics Ltd can bring an action to recover both the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣)
In the case of GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣 (precedent p), the court ruled that the defences of estoppel and force majeure put forward by the defendant (D) were unarguable. The court granted summary judgment in favour of the plaintiff (P) for the total sum claimed, as the defences lacked sufficient evidence and legal merit.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Estoppel**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In the precedent case, the defendant claimed that the plaintiff was estopped from enforcing the debt due to representations made by an individual allegedly on behalf of the plaintiff. The court found that there was no clear and unequivocal promise, and the individual lacked authority to bind the plaintiff.
  - **Current Case**: Gabrielle claims that the additional £5,000 for the drains should be absorbed by Pyrotechnics Ltd as part of the original project, implying an estoppel based on the initial agreement.

- **Legal Concept 2: Force Majeure**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In the precedent case, the defendant argued that force majeure events (the Pandemic and Civil War) made it impossible to perform payment obligations. The court found this defence unarguable as the events did not directly affect the defendant's ability to pay.
  - **Current Case**: Although not explicitly stated, Gabrielle's argument that she cannot afford the bonus due to Zolt's departure and her trading alone could be seen as an attempt to invoke a force majeure-like defence, arguing changed circumstances.

- **Legal Concept 3: Contractual Modifications**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In the precedent case, the court emphasized that any modification to the agreement required written consent, and informal agreements or representations were insufficient.
  - **Current Case**: Gabrielle's attempt to modify the payment terms (absorbing the £5,000 and not paying the £3,000 bonus) without written consent from Pyrotechnics Ltd mirrors the need for formal modifications.

- **Legal Concept 4: Summary Judgment**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: The court in the precedent case granted summary judgment as the defences were found to be unarguable and lacking sufficient evidence.
  - **Current Case**: Pyrotechnics Ltd could seek summary judgment for the additional £5,000 and the £3,000 bonus, arguing that Gabrielle's defences are unarguable and unsupported by evidence.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣)
This suggests a general rule that when we see fact patterns involving unsubstantiated defences of estoppel, force majeure, and informal contractual modifications without written consent, the court should decide in favour of enforcing the original contractual terms. This rule was justified in GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣 because the positive effects (E+) of upholding clear contractual obligations and requiring formal modifications outweigh the negative effects (E-) of allowing informal and unsupported defences to disrupt contractual certainty.

Therefore, Pyrotechnics Ltd can bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000, as Gabrielle's defences are likely to be found unarguable and unsupported by sufficient evidence, similar to the precedent case.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Estoppel**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In the precedent case, the defendant claimed that the plaintiff was estopped from enforcing the debt due to representations made by an individual allegedly on behalf of the plaintiff. The court found that there was no clear and unequivocal promise, and the individual lacked authority to bind the plaintiff.
  - **Current Case**: Gabrielle claims that the additional £5,000 for the drains should be absorbed by Pyrotechnics Ltd as part of the original project, implying an estoppel based on the initial agreement. However, there is no clear and unequivocal promise from Pyrotechnics Ltd to absorb these costs, nor is there evidence that Pyrotechnics Ltd agreed to such terms.

- **Legal Concept 2: Force Majeure**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In the precedent case, the defendant argued that force majeure events (the Pandemic and Civil War) made it impossible to perform payment obligations. The court found this defence unarguable as the events did not directly affect the defendant's ability to pay.
  - **Current Case**: Although not explicitly stated, Gabrielle's argument that she cannot afford the bonus due to Zolt's departure and her trading alone could be seen as an attempt to invoke a force majeure-like defence, arguing changed circumstances. However, Zolt's departure and Gabrielle's financial situation do not constitute force majeure events that would make it impossible for her to fulfill the payment obligations.

- **Legal Concept 3: Contractual Modifications**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In the precedent case, the court emphasized that any modification to the agreement required written consent, and informal agreements or representations were insufficient.
  - **Current Case**: Gabrielle's attempt to modify the payment terms (absorbing the £5,000 and not paying the £3,000 bonus) without written consent from Pyrotechnics Ltd mirrors the need for formal modifications. There is no written agreement modifying the original contract terms, making Gabrielle's unilateral modifications unenforceable.

- **Legal Concept 4: Summary Judgment**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: The court in the precedent case granted summary judgment as the defences were found to be unarguable and lacking sufficient evidence.
  - **Current Case**: Pyrotechnics Ltd could seek summary judgment for the additional £5,000 and the £3,000 bonus, arguing that Gabrielle's defences are unarguable and unsupported by evidence. Given the clear terms of the original contract and the lack of formal modification, Pyrotechnics Ltd has a strong case for summary judgment.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Contractual Certainty**: Enforcing the original contractual terms and requiring formal modifications ensures that parties can rely on the agreements they enter into, promoting stability and predictability in commercial transactions.
2. **Discouraging Informal and Unsubstantiated Defences**: By rejecting unsubstantiated defences such as informal estoppel claims and force majeure-like arguments without clear evidence, the court reinforces the importance of adhering to legal standards and evidentiary requirements.
3. **Encouraging Proper Documentation**: Emphasizing the need for written consent for contractual modifications encourages parties to document their agreements properly, reducing the likelihood of disputes and misunderstandings.

Therefore, Pyrotechnics Ltd should be able to bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000, as Gabrielle's defences are likely to be found unarguable and unsupported by sufficient evidence, similar to the precedent case.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of clear and unequivocal representations and the authority of the individual making those representations. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling (upholding contractual certainty and requiring formal modifications) outweighed any potential drawbacks (such as the defendant's financial difficulties) because it provided a clear basis for rejecting the estoppel defence. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of clear and unequivocal representations is notably absent as Gabrielle's claim that the additional £5,000 for the drains should be absorbed by Pyrotechnics Ltd is not based on any clear and unequivocal promise from Pyrotechnics Ltd, nor is there evidence that Pyrotechnics Ltd agreed to such terms.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor of the departure of a key party (Zolt) that was not present in GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because Zolt's departure and Gabrielle's subsequent financial difficulties introduce a new element of changed circumstances that were not considered in the precedent case. Due to Zolt's departure, applying the same outcome (enforcing the original contractual terms without considering the changed circumstances) in our case would have more negative consequences such as potential financial hardship for Gabrielle and the risk of Pyrotechnics Ltd not receiving any payment at all if Gabrielle's business fails, unlike in GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣 because the precedent case did not involve such a significant change in the parties' circumstances.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣** should be stated as "When both [the presence of clear and unequivocal representations] and [the authority of the individual making those representations] are present, the court should decide [to reject the estoppel defence and enforce the original contractual terms]." Omitting [the authority of the individual making those representations] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q], which is the enforcement of informal and unsupported defences that disrupt contractual certainty and stability. Indeed, the opinion in **GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣** explicitly states that the lack of authority of the individual making the representations was crucial to their decision, as it provided a clear basis for rejecting the estoppel defence.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence u] of allowing informal and unsupported defences to disrupt contractual certainty and stability. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [u] occurring because the departure of Zolt and Gabrielle's subsequent financial difficulties introduce a new element of changed circumstances that were not considered in the precedent case. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The court should consider the changed circumstances and the lack of clear and unequivocal representations in deciding whether Pyrotechnics Ltd can recover the additional £5,000 and the £3,000 bonus.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the clear and unequivocal representations and the authority of the individual making those representations, which were present in the precedent case **GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣**, requiring these factors for all similar cases of informal contractual modifications and estoppel defences would lead to the undesirable consequence of allowing parties to evade their contractual obligations based on informal and unsupported claims. Conversely, not requiring these factors would allow for the desirable outcome of upholding contractual certainty and stability, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law. This approach ensures that parties cannot unilaterally alter the terms of a contract without proper documentation and mutual consent, thereby promoting fairness and predictability in commercial transactions.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the clear and unequivocal representations and the authority of the individual making those representations, which were present in **GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣**, we have the additional factor of the explicit contractual terms and the lack of formal modification. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of informal attempts to modify contractual obligations, serves a similar function to the clear and unequivocal representations in the precedent case. Given the presence of explicit contractual terms and the lack of formal modification, we submit that the reasoning in **GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣** still applies, as the positive effects on upholding contractual certainty and requiring formal modifications would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. This ensures that Pyrotechnics Ltd can bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000, as Gabrielle's defences are likely to be found unarguable and unsupported by sufficient evidence.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the issues of estoppel, force majeure, and the need for formal contractual modifications. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of clear and unequivocal representations and the departure of a key party (Zolt), which introduces a new element of changed circumstances.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case—that informal and unsupported defences should not disrupt contractual certainty and that formal modifications are required—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the unique circumstances of the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that upholding contractual certainty and requiring formal modifications promotes stability and predictability in commercial transactions. On the other hand, the counterargument that Zolt's departure and Gabrielle's financial difficulties introduce a new element that was not considered in the precedent case is also compelling.

Considering the underlying legal principles of contract law, which emphasize the importance of clear agreements and formal modifications, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Pyrotechnics Ltd should be able to bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000. Gabrielle's defences are likely to be found unarguable and unsupported by sufficient evidence, similar to the precedent case.

This decision is reached because the positive effects of upholding contractual certainty and requiring formal modifications outweigh the potential negative consequences of Gabrielle's financial difficulties. The absence of clear and unequivocal representations and the lack of formal modification of the contract terms are crucial factors that support this outcome. Therefore, Pyrotechnics Ltd has a strong case for summary judgment to recover the additional amounts owed.

1. CACV 261/2010 BETWEEN H Applicant and N Respondent

   Conditions:
   - A contract is entered into as a result of duress, where a relevant operative threat may be a threat to the victim’s person (or spouse or near relative), or to his property, or a wrongful and illegitimate threat to his economic interests
   - The pressure or threat is illegitimate
   - The effect on the victim is that it deprives the victim of any practical choice other than to enter into the contract

   Consequences:
   - The contract may be avoided by the party who was threatened

   Exceptions:
   - The threat is not illegitimate
   - The victim had practical alternatives other than entering into the contract

2. CACV 261/2010 BETWEEN H Applicant and N Respondent

   Conditions:
   - A transaction between two parties who are in a relationship of trust and confidence is the result of an abuse of the relationship

   Exceptions:
   - The wrongdoer can disprove the apparent causal connection and show that the complainant would have entered into the transaction on the same terms even without the undue influence

4. Magic Score Limited v The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited

   Conditions:
   - The weaker party's apparent consent was induced by pressure exercised upon them by the other party which the law does not regard as legitimate
   - The pressure consists of unlawful threats or amounts to unconscionable conduct
   - The pressure constitutes a significant cause for the weaker party to have entered into the agreement

   Consequences:
   - The contract entered into under duress is treated in law as revocable unless approbated either expressly or by implication after the illegitimate pressure has ceased to operate on the weaker party's mind

   Exceptions:
   - The pressure is merely overwhelming but not unconscionable or unlawful
   - The weaker party approbates the contract after the illegitimate pressure has ceased

### Minor Premise:

1. CACV 261/2010 BETWEEN H Applicant and N Respondent:
   - Pyrotechnics Ltd entered into an agreement to accept £40,000 in full and final settlement due to economic pressure from Gabrielle.
   - The pressure was illegitimate as it involved a wrongful and illegitimate threat to Pyrotechnics Ltd's economic interests.
   - Pyrotechnics Ltd had no practical choice other than to accept the £40,000 due to their own creditors pressing them.
   - Therefore, the contract may be avoided by Pyrotechnics Ltd.

2. CACV 261/2010 BETWEEN H Applicant and N Respondent:
   - There is no evidence of a relationship of trust and confidence between Pyrotechnics Ltd and Gabrielle.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

3. Leung Ping Chiu, Roy v Wai Wai Chen and Another [2021] HKCA 941:
   - There is no evidence of undue influence being exercised by Gabrielle over Pyrotechnics Ltd.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

4. Magic Score Limited v The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited:
   - Pyrotechnics Ltd's consent to accept £40,000 was induced by economic pressure from Gabrielle.
   - The pressure was unconscionable as it involved a wrongful and illegitimate threat to Pyrotechnics Ltd's economic interests.
   - The pressure was a significant cause for Pyrotechnics Ltd to accept the £40,000.
   - Therefore, the contract entered into under duress is revocable unless approbated after the illegitimate pressure ceased.

### Conclusion:

Pyrotechnics Ltd can argue that the agreement to accept £40,000 in full and final settlement was made under duress. Therefore, they can bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (LKF v. ZTISL)

In the case of LKF v. ZTISL [2024] HKCFI 424; HCSD 8/2023 (31 January 2024) (precedent p), the court ruled that the applicant failed to establish an arguable case for setting aside a statutory demand on the grounds of unconscionable bargain and duress. The court emphasized that the burden of proof for setting aside a statutory demand is higher than that for opposing an Order 14 application for summary judgment. Specifically, the applicant must show a substantial defence, meaning a defence of substance, rather than merely asserting the existence of a dispute or counterclaim.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in LKF v. ZTISL and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Unconscionable Bargain**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In LKF v. ZTISL, the applicant argued that he was at a serious disadvantage due to lack of education and legal advice, and that the terms of the agreement were oppressive. However, the court found no substantial evidence to support these claims.
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In our current case, Gabrielle argues that the additional £5,000 for the drains should be absorbed by Pyrotechnics Ltd as part of the original project, and that she cannot afford the bonus due to her financial situation.

- **Duress**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In LKF v. ZTISL, the applicant claimed that he signed the agreement under duress due to threats of termination of his working relationship. The court found no evidence of illegitimate pressure or bad faith.
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In our current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd might argue that they accepted the £40,000 in full and final settlement under economic duress, as they were being pressed by their own creditors and felt compelled to accept the reduced payment.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (LKF v. ZTISL)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of an alleged unconscionable bargain or duress, the court should decide against setting aside the agreement unless there is substantial evidence to support the claims. This rule was justified in LKF v. ZTISL because the positive effects (E+) of requiring substantial evidence to support claims of unconscionable bargain or duress outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially allowing some unfair agreements to stand. This approach ensures that only well-substantiated claims can disrupt contractual agreements, thereby promoting stability and predictability in commercial transactions.

In applying this rule to our current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd would need to provide substantial evidence that the agreement to accept £40,000 in full and final settlement was made under duress or undue influence. Given the precedent set in LKF v. ZTISL, mere assertions of financial pressure or unfair terms are insufficient. Pyrotechnics Ltd must demonstrate that the pressure exerted by Gabrielle was illegitimate and that they had no realistic practical alternative but to accept the reduced payment. If they can meet this higher burden of proof, they may have grounds to recover the additional £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (LKF v. ZTISL) are present:

- **Unconscionable Bargain**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In LKF v. ZTISL, the applicant argued that he was at a serious disadvantage due to lack of education and legal advice, and that the terms of the agreement were oppressive. However, the court found no substantial evidence to support these claims.
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In our current case, Gabrielle argues that the additional £5,000 for the drains should be absorbed by Pyrotechnics Ltd as part of the original project, and that she cannot afford the bonus due to her financial situation.

- **Duress**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In LKF v. ZTISL, the applicant claimed that he signed the agreement under duress due to threats of termination of his working relationship. The court found no evidence of illegitimate pressure or bad faith.
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In our current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd might argue that they accepted the £40,000 in full and final settlement under economic duress, as they were being pressed by their own creditors and felt compelled to accept the reduced payment.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in LKF v. ZTISL. This decision would be justified because, as in LKF v. ZTISL, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Promoting Stability and Predictability in Commercial Transactions**: By requiring substantial evidence to support claims of unconscionable bargain or duress, the court ensures that only well-substantiated claims can disrupt contractual agreements. This promotes stability and predictability in commercial transactions, which is crucial for business confidence and economic stability.

2. **Preventing Abuse of Legal Remedies**: The higher burden of proof prevents parties from easily setting aside agreements based on mere assertions of unfairness or financial pressure. This discourages frivolous claims and ensures that legal remedies are reserved for genuinely aggrieved parties.

3. **Encouraging Fair Negotiations**: By upholding agreements unless substantial evidence of duress or unconscionable conduct is provided, the court encourages parties to negotiate fairly and seek legal advice before entering into contracts. This fosters a more equitable commercial environment.

4. **Protecting Legitimate Business Interests**: In the current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd must demonstrate that the pressure exerted by Gabrielle was illegitimate and that they had no realistic practical alternative but to accept the reduced payment. This protects legitimate business interests by ensuring that parties cannot easily evade their contractual obligations.

Given these positive effects, the court should apply the same outcome as in LKF v. ZTISL and require Pyrotechnics Ltd to provide substantial evidence of duress or unconscionable bargain to recover the additional £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case LKF v. ZTISL, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the lack of substantial evidence provided by the applicant to support claims of unconscionable bargain and duress. This lack of evidence was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—promoting stability and predictability in commercial transactions, preventing abuse of legal remedies, encouraging fair negotiations, and protecting legitimate business interests—outweighed any potential drawbacks. However, in our current case, this crucial lack of substantial evidence is notably absent as Pyrotechnics Ltd has not yet provided detailed evidence to support their claims of duress or unconscionable bargain. Therefore, the court may not be able to make a similar ruling without a thorough examination of the evidence.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in LKF v. ZTISL: the specific financial pressure faced by Pyrotechnics Ltd due to their own creditors. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of economic duress. Because of this financial pressure, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as potentially allowing Gabrielle to evade her contractual obligations under the guise of financial hardship, than positive ones. Unlike in LKF v. ZTISL, where the applicant failed to provide substantial evidence, Pyrotechnics Ltd's financial pressure and the context of their agreement with Gabrielle could provide a more compelling case for economic duress, thereby justifying a different outcome.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from LKF v. ZTISL should be stated as: "When both the fact pattern of an alleged unconscionable bargain or duress (i*) and substantial evidence of financial pressure or illegitimate conduct (m) are present, the court should decide to set aside the agreement (o)." Omitting the requirement for substantial evidence (m) from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence (q) of allowing parties to easily evade their contractual obligations based on mere assertions of unfairness or financial pressure. Indeed, the opinion in LKF v. ZTISL explicitly states that the applicant must provide substantial evidence to support claims of unconscionable bargain or duress, highlighting the importance of this requirement to their decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in LKF v. ZTISL was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence (u) of frivolous claims disrupting contractual agreements, thereby promoting stability and predictability in commercial transactions. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because Pyrotechnics Ltd has the potential to provide substantial evidence of financial pressure and illegitimate conduct by Gabrielle. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule without considering the specific financial pressure faced by Pyrotechnics Ltd would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—to prevent frivolous claims—does not apply to our situation where there is a genuine issue of economic duress.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the substantial evidence of financial pressure or illegitimate conduct (factor m), which was present in the precedent case LKF v. ZTISL, requiring this factor for all similar cases of alleged unconscionable bargain or duress (fact pattern i*) would lead to the undesirable consequence of potentially allowing parties to evade their contractual obligations based on mere assertions of unfairness or financial pressure. Conversely, not requiring substantial evidence (m) would allow for a more equitable resolution in cases where genuine financial pressure and illegitimate conduct are present but not yet fully substantiated. This approach better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which aim to ensure fairness and prevent exploitation in contractual relationships.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the substantial evidence of financial pressure or illegitimate conduct (factor m), which was present in LKF v. ZTISL, we have the additional factor of Pyrotechnics Ltd's specific financial pressure due to their own creditors (factor n). This financial pressure (n), when considered alongside the shared circumstances of economic duress and unconscionable bargain (i*), serves a similar function to the substantial evidence (m) in the precedent case. Given the presence of this financial pressure (n), we submit that the reasoning in LKF v. ZTISL still applies, as the positive effects on promoting fairness and preventing exploitation in contractual relationships would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to LKF v. ZTISL, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in the context of alleged economic duress and unconscionable bargain. However, it also differs in significant ways, notably the specific financial pressure faced by Pyrotechnics Ltd due to their own creditors, which was not present in LKF v. ZTISL.

The proposed legal rule from LKF v. ZTISL—that substantial evidence is required to support claims of unconscionable bargain or duress—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the unique financial pressures faced by Pyrotechnics Ltd.

We've weighed arguments from both sides. On one hand, the precedent emphasizes the need for substantial evidence to prevent frivolous claims and ensure stability in commercial transactions. On the other hand, the specific financial pressure faced by Pyrotechnics Ltd and the context of their agreement with Gabrielle provide a more compelling case for economic duress, suggesting that a rigid application of the precedent may not serve justice in this instance.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, prevention of exploitation, and the need for substantial evidence to support claims, we conclude that Pyrotechnics Ltd should be allowed to bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000. This decision is justified by the specific financial pressures they faced and the potential illegitimate conduct by Gabrielle, which warrants a thorough examination of the evidence.

Therefore, while the precedent in LKF v. ZTISL provides valuable guidance, the unique circumstances of this case necessitate a more nuanced application of the legal principles involved. Pyrotechnics Ltd should be given the opportunity to present substantial evidence of economic duress and unconscionable bargain to support their claims.

   - Therefore, this section applies, and Pyrotechnics Ltd can recover a sum not exceeding the value of the benefit obtained by Gabrielle and Zolt, as the court considers just.

### Conclusion:

Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3 applies, and Pyrotechnics Ltd can bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000, as these amounts represent the value of the benefit obtained by Gabrielle and Zolt. The opening of Gabrizo 2 in Oxford indicates that Gabrielle and Zolt have the financial means to pay the additional amounts owed.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (SHANDONG CHENMING PAPER HOLDINGS LIMITED v. ARJOWIGGINS HKK 2 LIMITED)
In the case of SHANDONG CHENMING PAPER HOLDINGS LIMITED v. ARJOWIGGINS HKK 2 LIMITED (precedent p), the court dealt with the issue of a company's inability to pay its debts and the use of statutory demands as a mechanism to establish insolvency. The court ruled that failure to comply with a statutory demand operates as conclusive proof of insolvency for the purposes of engaging the jurisdiction to wind up a company, even if the company is, in fact, solvent. This ruling underscores the principle that a statutory demand is a legitimate means to enforce payment of an undisputed debt.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in SHANDONG CHENMING PAPER HOLDINGS LIMITED v. ARJOWIGGINS HKK 2 LIMITED and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Statutory Demand and Debt Enforcement**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In the precedent case, the statutory demand was used to enforce payment of an undisputed debt. In the current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd seeks to enforce payment of the additional £5,000 for the drain work and the £3,000 bonus, which are also undisputed debts.

- **Legal Concept 2: Financial Means and Ability to Pay**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** In the precedent case, the court considered the company's ability to pay its debts as a factor in determining insolvency. In the current case, the opening of Gabrizo 2 in Oxford indicates that Gabrielle and Zolt have the financial means to pay the additional amounts owed.

- **Legal Concept 3: Commercial Pressure to Settle Debts**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** The precedent case recognized the propriety of using a winding-up petition to apply commercial pressure to settle an undisputed debt. Similarly, in the current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd can use the threat of legal action to apply pressure on Gabrielle and Zolt to settle the additional amounts owed.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (SHANDONG CHENMING PAPER HOLDINGS LIMITED v. ARJOWIGGINS HKK 2 LIMITED)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a creditor seeking to enforce payment of an undisputed debt (i*), the court should decide in favor of the creditor's right to enforce payment (outcome o). This rule was justified in SHANDONG CHENMING PAPER HOLDINGS LIMITED v. ARJOWIGGINS HKK 2 LIMITED because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring creditors can recover undisputed debts efficiently and maintaining commercial certainty outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially pressuring solvent companies.

Applying this rule to the current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd should be able to bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000. The opening of Gabrizo 2 in Oxford indicates that Gabrielle and Zolt have the financial means to pay these additional amounts, and the use of legal action to enforce these undisputed debts is consistent with the principles established in the precedent case.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (SHANDONG CHENMING PAPER HOLDINGS LIMITED v. ARJOWIGGINS HKK 2 LIMITED) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Statutory Demand and Debt Enforcement**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In the precedent case, the statutory demand was used to enforce payment of an undisputed debt. In the current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd seeks to enforce payment of the additional £5,000 for the drain work and the £3,000 bonus, which are also undisputed debts.

- **Legal Concept 2: Financial Means and Ability to Pay**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** In the precedent case, the court considered the company's ability to pay its debts as a factor in determining insolvency. In the current case, the opening of Gabrizo 2 in Oxford indicates that Gabrielle and Zolt have the financial means to pay the additional amounts owed.

- **Legal Concept 3: Commercial Pressure to Settle Debts**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** The precedent case recognized the propriety of using a winding-up petition to apply commercial pressure to settle an undisputed debt. Similarly, in the current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd can use the threat of legal action to apply pressure on Gabrielle and Zolt to settle the additional amounts owed.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome: Pyrotechnics Ltd should be able to bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000. This decision would be justified because, as in SHANDONG CHENMING PAPER HOLDINGS LIMITED v. ARJOWIGGINS HKK 2 LIMITED, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Creditors Can Recover Undisputed Debts Efficiently:** Allowing Pyrotechnics Ltd to recover the additional amounts owed would reinforce the principle that creditors have a right to enforce payment of undisputed debts, thereby maintaining commercial certainty and trust in contractual agreements.

2. **Maintaining Commercial Pressure as a Legitimate Tool:** The use of legal action to apply commercial pressure on debtors to settle undisputed debts is a recognized and legitimate practice. This ensures that debtors cannot evade their financial obligations by simply refusing to pay.

3. **Promoting Fairness and Equity:** Given that Gabrielle and Zolt have the financial means to pay the additional amounts, as evidenced by their plans to open a new establishment, it would be equitable to require them to fulfill their financial obligations to Pyrotechnics Ltd.

4. **Preventing Abuse of Process:** By allowing Pyrotechnics Ltd to recover the additional amounts, the court would prevent Gabrielle and Zolt from taking advantage of their creditors by avoiding payment under the guise of financial incapacity, which is contradicted by their business expansion plans.

Therefore, the court should allow Pyrotechnics Ltd to bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000, consistent with the principles established in the precedent case.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor of **"reluctant agreement under financial pressure"** that was not present in **SHANDONG CHENMING PAPER HOLDINGS LIMITED v. ARJOWIGGINS HKK 2 LIMITED**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of **"creditor seeking to enforce payment of an undisputed debt"** because the agreement to accept £40,000 as full and final settlement was made under duress due to Pyrotechnics Ltd's financial pressure from their own creditors. Due to this factor, applying the same outcome of allowing the creditor to enforce payment in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the finality of settlements and encouraging litigation over settled matters than positive ones, unlike in **SHANDONG CHENMING PAPER HOLDINGS LIMITED v. ARJOWIGGINS HKK 2 LIMITED** because the precedent case did not involve a settlement agreement made under financial duress.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from **SHANDONG CHENMING PAPER HOLDINGS LIMITED v. ARJOWIGGINS HKK 2 LIMITED** should be stated as: "When both [a creditor seeking to enforce payment of an undisputed debt] and [a settlement agreement made under financial duress] are present, the court should decide [against allowing the creditor to enforce additional payment]." Omitting [a settlement agreement made under financial duress] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of undermining the finality of settlements and encouraging litigation over settled matters]. Indeed, the opinion in **SHANDONG CHENMING PAPER HOLDINGS LIMITED v. ARJOWIGGINS HKK 2 LIMITED** explicitly states that the statutory demand mechanism is a legitimate means to enforce payment of an undisputed debt, but it does not address situations where a settlement agreement was made under financial duress, which is crucial to our current case.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in **SHANDONG CHENMING PAPER HOLDINGS LIMITED v. ARJOWIGGINS HKK 2 LIMITED** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of debtors evading their financial obligations by simply refusing to pay undisputed debts]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [debtors evading their financial obligations] because Pyrotechnics Ltd agreed to the settlement under financial duress, which is a different context. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The focus should be on the fairness and finality of the settlement agreement made under duress, rather than the enforcement of undisputed debts.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the explicit use of a statutory demand, which was present in the precedent case **SHANDONG CHENMING PAPER HOLDINGS LIMITED v. ARJOWIGGINS HKK 2 LIMITED**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of enforcing payment of an undisputed debt would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would limit the ability of creditors to recover debts efficiently and would undermine the principle that creditors have a right to enforce payment of undisputed debts. Conversely, not requiring the explicit use of a statutory demand would allow for a more flexible and pragmatic approach to debt recovery, which better aligns with the underlying principles of commercial certainty and fairness in contract law. This approach ensures that creditors can still apply commercial pressure to recover debts without being constrained by procedural technicalities.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the explicit use of a statutory demand, which was present in **SHANDONG CHENMING PAPER HOLDINGS LIMITED v. ARJOWIGGINS HKK 2 LIMITED**, we have the additional factor of a settlement agreement made under financial duress. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of a creditor seeking to enforce payment of an undisputed debt, serves a similar function to the statutory demand in the precedent case. Given the presence of the settlement agreement made under financial duress, we submit that the reasoning in **SHANDONG CHENMING PAPER HOLDINGS LIMITED v. ARJOWIGGINS HKK 2 LIMITED** still applies, as the positive effects on ensuring creditors can recover undisputed debts efficiently and maintaining commercial certainty would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. The settlement agreement under duress highlights the need for fairness and equity, ensuring that creditors are not unfairly pressured into accepting less than what is owed.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **SHANDONG CHENMING PAPER HOLDINGS LIMITED v. ARJOWIGGINS HKK 2 LIMITED**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the enforcement of an undisputed debt and the use of commercial pressure to settle debts. However, it also differs significantly in that the settlement agreement in the current case was made under financial duress, which was not a factor in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case—that a creditor can enforce payment of an undisputed debt through a statutory demand—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the settlement agreement made under financial duress in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that enforcing the additional payment aligns with the principle of ensuring creditors can recover undisputed debts efficiently (Step 4) and the counterargument that enforcing the additional payment would undermine the finality of settlements and encourage litigation over settled matters (Step 6).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, equity, and commercial certainty, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Pyrotechnics Ltd should not be able to bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000. This decision is reached because the settlement agreement, albeit made under financial duress, was accepted by Pyrotechnics Ltd as full and final settlement. Enforcing additional payments would undermine the finality of settlements and could lead to undesirable consequences in commercial practices.

Key factors influencing this outcome include the need to uphold the integrity of settlement agreements and the recognition that Pyrotechnics Ltd had the opportunity to reject the settlement but chose to accept it under the circumstances. Therefore, while the principles from the precedent case are relevant, the unique context of the current case necessitates a different outcome to serve justice and legal consistency.

2. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 6 Subsection 1

   Conditions:
   - A third party may enforce a term of a contract under section 4 of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance.
   - The third party has assented to the term and the promisor has received notice of the assent; or
   - The third party has relied on the term and the promisor is aware of the reliance or can reasonably be expected to have foreseen that the third party would rely on the term.

   Consequences:
   - The parties to the contract may not, without the third party’s consent, rescind or vary the contract so that the third party’s right under the term is altered or extinguished.

   Exceptions:
   - An express term of the contract provides that one or more parties to the contract may rescind or vary the contract without the third party’s consent; or
   - The third party’s consent to rescind or vary the contract is required in circumstances specified in the contract instead of those set out in subsection (2)(a) and (b).

### Minor Premise:

1. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 8 Subsection 2:
- Pyrotechnics Ltd entered into a contract with Gabrielle and Zolt for the supply of refurbishment services.
- The additional work on the drains and the bonus for timely completion were not excluded or restricted by an express term inconsistent with the implied term.
- The right to payment for the additional work and the bonus may be negatived or varied by express agreement or by the course of dealing between the parties.
- Gabrielle and Zolt agreed to pay the additional £5,000 and the £3,000 bonus, which was not excluded by any express term.

2. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 6 Subsection 1:
- The third party (Pyrotechnics Ltd) may enforce the term of the contract regarding the additional £5,000 and the £3,000 bonus.
- Pyrotechnics Ltd relied on the promise of the bonus and the additional payment, and Gabrielle and Zolt were aware of this reliance.
- The parties to the contract (Gabrielle and Zolt) cannot rescind or vary the contract without Pyrotechnics Ltd’s consent, as it would alter or extinguish Pyrotechnics Ltd’s right under the term.

### Conclusion:

Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 8 Subsection 2 and Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 6 Subsection 1 apply. Pyrotechnics Ltd can bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000, as the terms were not excluded by any express term and Pyrotechnics Ltd relied on these terms with the knowledge of Gabrielle and Zolt.

## Deductive Reasoning: ca

### Relevant law:

CACV 344/2002

### Major Premise:

1. CACV 344/2002

   Conditions:
   - There is a clear and unequivocal representation by A to B that A will not rely on his strict contractual rights, which may be by words or by conduct.
   - The representation by A is made with the intention or knowledge that B will act on it.
   - B acts in reliance on the representation.

   Consequences:
   - The doctrine of equitable or promissory estoppel may apply to prevent A from going back on his promise or representation.

   Exceptions:
   - It is not inequitable or unfair to allow A to go back on his promise or representation.

### Minor Premise:

1. CACV 344/2002:
- Gabrielle and Zolt (A) made a clear and unequivocal representation to Pyrotechnics Ltd (B) that they would pay a bonus of £3,000 if the work stayed on schedule.
- The representation was made with the intention or knowledge that Pyrotechnics Ltd would act on it, as evidenced by Pyrotechnics Ltd rescheduling other work and paying their staff overtime to work weekends.
- Pyrotechnics Ltd acted in reliance on the representation by rescheduling other work and paying their staff overtime to ensure the project stayed on schedule.

   Therefore, the doctrine of equitable or promissory estoppel may apply to prevent Gabrielle from going back on her promise to pay the £3,000 bonus.

   Exceptions:
   - It is not inequitable or unfair to allow Gabrielle to go back on her promise, as she claims financial hardship due to Zolt leaving the country and her trading alone. However, this claim is undermined by the fact that Gabrielle and Zolt are opening a new restaurant, Gabrizo 2, in Oxford, indicating that they are not in financial distress.

### Conclusion:

The principle of promissory estoppel applies to prevent Gabrielle from reneging on the promise to pay the £3,000 bonus. Pyrotechnics Ltd can bring an action to recover the £3,000 bonus. Additionally, Pyrotechnics Ltd can also bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains, as this was additional work not covered by the original £80,000 quote.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA000315A/1999 BETWEEN CHEUNG SHUET LEE Plaintiff AND BIRKART-EAST WEST FREIGHT LIMITED Defendant)
In the case of HCA000315A/1999 BETWEEN CHEUNG SHUET LEE Plaintiff AND BIRKART-EAST WEST FREIGHT LIMITED Defendant (precedent p), the plaintiff, Cheung Shuet Lee, claimed a settlement amount based on a computation she presented to the defendant, Birkart-East West Freight Limited. The court ruled that the plaintiff's claim was not credible and that there was no enforceable agreement to pay her more than her contractual and statutory entitlements. The court found that the plaintiff had misrepresented her entitlements and that there was no consideration to support any additional payment beyond what was legally owed. Consequently, the court dismissed the plaintiff's claim and allowed the defendant's counterclaim for overpayment.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA000315A/1999 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Misrepresentation**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA000315A/1999, the plaintiff misrepresented her entitlements to the defendant. In our current case, Gabrielle misrepresented the financial situation and the terms of the original agreement to Pyrotechnics Ltd.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Consideration**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA000315A/1999, the court found that there was no consideration to support the additional payment claimed by the plaintiff. In our current case, the additional £5,000 for the drains and the £3,000 bonus were not supported by new consideration from Gabrielle and Zolt.
  
- **Legal Concept 3: Duress**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA000315A/1999, the plaintiff applied pressure tactics to obtain the defendant's approval. In our current case, Gabrielle applied financial pressure on Pyrotechnics Ltd by stating she could not afford the additional payments and that Zolt had left the country.
  
- **Legal Concept 4: Unjust Enrichment**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCA000315A/1999, the court allowed the defendant's counterclaim for overpayment under the principle of unjust enrichment. In our current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd could argue that Gabrielle and Zolt would be unjustly enriched if they do not pay the additional £5,000 and the £3,000 bonus.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA000315A/1999)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of misrepresentation, lack of consideration, duress, and potential unjust enrichment, the court should decide against enforcing any additional payments beyond the original contractual and statutory entitlements. This rule was justified in HCA000315A/1999 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that parties cannot claim additional payments through misrepresentation and without proper consideration outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially denying a party additional compensation they might feel entitled to.

Applying this rule to our current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd should be able to bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000. The misrepresentation by Gabrielle, the lack of new consideration for the additional payments, the financial duress applied, and the potential for unjust enrichment all align with the fact patterns and legal concepts identified in the precedent case. Therefore, the court should rule in favor of Pyrotechnics Ltd, allowing them to recover the additional amounts owed.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA000315A/1999 BETWEEN CHEUNG SHUET LEE Plaintiff AND BIRKART-EAST WEST FREIGHT LIMITED Defendant) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Misrepresentation**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA000315A/1999, the plaintiff misrepresented her entitlements to the defendant. In our current case, Gabrielle misrepresented the financial situation and the terms of the original agreement to Pyrotechnics Ltd by stating that the additional £5,000 for the drains should be absorbed as part of the original project and that she could not afford the £3,000 bonus due to Zolt's departure.

- **Legal Concept 2: Consideration**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA000315A/1999, the court found that there was no consideration to support the additional payment claimed by the plaintiff. In our current case, the additional £5,000 for the drains and the £3,000 bonus were not supported by new consideration from Gabrielle and Zolt. The promise to pay the bonus was made to ensure timely completion, which was already an obligation under the original contract.

- **Legal Concept 3: Duress**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA000315A/1999, the plaintiff applied pressure tactics to obtain the defendant's approval. In our current case, Gabrielle applied financial pressure on Pyrotechnics Ltd by stating she could not afford the additional payments and that Zolt had left the country, effectively coercing Pyrotechnics Ltd into accepting the £40,000 as full and final settlement.

- **Legal Concept 4: Unjust Enrichment**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCA000315A/1999, the court allowed the defendant's counterclaim for overpayment under the principle of unjust enrichment. In our current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd could argue that Gabrielle and Zolt would be unjustly enriched if they do not pay the additional £5,000 and the £3,000 bonus, as they have benefited from the timely completion of the project and the additional work on the drains.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCA000315A/1999. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Contractual Integrity**: Enforcing the additional payments would ensure that parties cannot evade their contractual obligations through misrepresentation or duress.
2. **Preventing Unjust Enrichment**: It would prevent Gabrielle and Zolt from being unjustly enriched at the expense of Pyrotechnics Ltd, who have already incurred additional costs and efforts.
3. **Promoting Fairness**: It would promote fairness by ensuring that Pyrotechnics Ltd is compensated for the additional work and efforts they undertook to meet the project deadline.
4. **Deterring Misconduct**: It would deter similar misconduct in future contractual relationships, thereby fostering a more honest and transparent business environment.

Therefore, Pyrotechnics Ltd should be able to bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA000315A/1999 BETWEEN CHEUNG SHUET LEE Plaintiff AND BIRKART-EAST WEST FREIGHT LIMITED Defendant, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the factor of **misrepresentation**. Misrepresentation was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling (upholding contractual integrity and preventing unjust enrichment) outweighed any potential drawbacks (denying additional compensation) because the plaintiff had dishonestly inflated her entitlements and misled the defendant. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of **misrepresentation** is notably absent as Gabrielle did not misrepresent the terms of the original agreement or the financial situation to Pyrotechnics Ltd. Instead, she made a post-contractual promise to pay a bonus and later reneged on it due to financial constraints.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor of **promissory estoppel** that was not present in HCA000315A/1999 BETWEEN CHEUNG SHUET LEE Plaintiff AND BIRKART-EAST WEST FREIGHT LIMITED Defendant. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because promissory estoppel can prevent a party from going back on a promise made when the other party has relied on that promise to their detriment. Due to the presence of promissory estoppel, applying the same outcome (denying additional payments) in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the reliance and trust in business promises and agreements, unlike in HCA000315A/1999 because Pyrotechnics Ltd rescheduled other work and paid their staff overtime based on Gabrielle's promise to pay the bonus. Therefore, the court should consider the principle of promissory estoppel and allow Pyrotechnics Ltd to recover the £3,000 bonus and the £5,000 for the additional work on the drains.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from HCA000315A/1999 BETWEEN CHEUNG SHUET LEE Plaintiff AND BIRKART-EAST WEST FREIGHT LIMITED Defendant should be stated as: "When both [misrepresentation, lack of consideration, duress, and potential unjust enrichment] and [absence of promissory estoppel] are present, the court should decide [against enforcing additional payments beyond the original contractual and statutory entitlements]." Omitting [the absence of promissory estoppel] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of undermining the reliance and trust in business promises and agreements]. Indeed, the opinion in HCA000315A/1999 explicitly states that [misrepresentation and lack of consideration were crucial to their decision], highlighting the importance of these factors in determining the outcome.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in HCA000315A/1999 was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties claiming additional payments through misrepresentation and without proper consideration]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [misrepresentation occurring]. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the principle of promissory estoppel should be considered, as it prevents Gabrielle from reneging on her promise to pay the £3,000 bonus, given that Pyrotechnics Ltd relied on this promise to their detriment. This ensures that business promises and agreements are upheld, fostering trust and reliability in contractual relationships.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of **misrepresentation**, which was present in the precedent case HCA000315A/1999 BETWEEN CHEUNG SHUET LEE Plaintiff AND BIRKART-EAST WEST FREIGHT LIMITED Defendant, requiring this factor for all similar cases of **contractual disputes involving additional payments** would lead to the undesirable consequence of allowing parties to renege on promises made in good faith, even when the other party has relied on those promises to their detriment. Conversely, not requiring **misrepresentation** would allow for the desirable outcome of upholding the principle of promissory estoppel, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area by ensuring that promises made and relied upon are enforceable, thereby fostering trust and reliability in contractual relationships.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of **misrepresentation**, which was present in HCA000315A/1999, we have the additional factor of **promissory estoppel**. This **promissory estoppel**, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of **contractual disputes involving additional payments**, serves a similar function to **misrepresentation** in the precedent case. Given the presence of **promissory estoppel**, we submit that the reasoning in HCA000315A/1999 still applies, as the positive effects on **upholding contractual integrity and preventing unjust enrichment** would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA000315A/1999 BETWEEN CHEUNG SHUET LEE Plaintiff AND BIRKART-EAST WEST FREIGHT LIMITED Defendant, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the issues of misrepresentation, lack of consideration, and potential unjust enrichment. However, it also differs significantly in the presence of promissory estoppel, which was not a factor in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case—that additional payments beyond the original contractual and statutory entitlements should not be enforced in the presence of misrepresentation, lack of consideration, duress, and potential unjust enrichment—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the principle of promissory estoppel.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that misrepresentation and lack of consideration were crucial to the decision in the precedent case, and the counterargument that promissory estoppel should prevent Gabrielle from reneging on her promise to pay the £3,000 bonus, given that Pyrotechnics Ltd relied on this promise to their detriment.

Considering the underlying legal principles of contractual integrity, prevention of unjust enrichment, and the enforcement of promises made in good faith, we conclude that Pyrotechnics Ltd should be able to bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by upholding the principle of promissory estoppel and ensuring that parties cannot evade their obligations through misrepresentation or duress.

Therefore, the court should rule in favor of Pyrotechnics Ltd, allowing them to recover the additional amounts owed. This outcome ensures that business promises and agreements are upheld, fostering trust and reliability in contractual relationships.

   - The implied term under Cap. 457 Section 5 requires Pyrotechnics Ltd to carry out the service with reasonable care and skill. This does not directly address whether additional work to comply with building regulations is included in the original quote.

2. **Additional Work and Contractual Terms**:
   - The additional work for relocating the drains was not anticipated at the time of the original contract. This suggests that the original quote of £80,000 did not include unforeseen compliance work.
   - Gabrielle and Zolt agreed to pay an additional £5,000 for the drain work, indicating a separate agreement for this additional work.

3. **Bonus Agreement**:
   - Gabrielle and Zolt promised a £3,000 bonus if the work stayed on schedule. Pyrotechnics Ltd fulfilled this condition by rescheduling other work and paying staff overtime, and Gabrizo opened on time.

4. **Full and Final Settlement**:
   - Pyrotechnics Ltd reluctantly accepted £40,000 in full and final settlement due to financial pressure. However, this acceptance was under duress and does not necessarily preclude them from seeking the additional amounts agreed upon.

### Conclusion:

Pyrotechnics Ltd can bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000. The original contract did not include the additional work required to comply with building regulations, and there was a separate agreement for this work. Additionally, the bonus was a separate contractual promise that was fulfilled by Pyrotechnics Ltd. The acceptance of £40,000 in full and final settlement was under duress and does not negate their right to claim the additional amounts.

## Deductive Reasoning: cfi

### Relevant law:

WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD [2024] HKCFI 45  
E. Bon Building Materials Company Limited v Walland Enterprises Limited

### Major Premise:

1. WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD [2024] HKCFI 45

   Conditions:
   - Work is requested or instructed which is in fact outside the scope of the variation clause.
   - The request or instruction is that of the Employer not the Architect, Engineer, or Contract Administrator under the variation clause, and/or no specific reference is made to the variation clause.
   - The Contractor then carries out the work under a direct instruction outside the contract.

   Consequences:
   - The Contractor will be entitled to reasonable remuneration on the basis of an implied reasonable price under a separate contract.

   Exceptions:
   - The Contractor complies with the instruction without objection, in which case the Contractor will be estopped or deemed to have waived any right to payment other than that obtainable under the terms of the clause.

2. E. Bon Building Materials Company Limited v Walland Enterprises Limited

   Conditions:
   - There is an existing contract between the parties to pay an agreed sum.
   - The work is included in the original contract sum.
   - The work is either 'indispensably necessary' or 'contingency necessary'.

   Consequences:
   - The defendant must carry it out and cannot recover extra payment for it.

   Exceptions:
   - The work is outside the contract.

### Minor Premise:

1. WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD [2024] HKCFI 45:
   - Pyrotechnics Ltd was instructed to relocate the drains, which was outside the scope of the original contract.
   - The instruction to relocate the drains came from Gabrielle and Zolt, the Employers, not from an Architect, Engineer, or Contract Administrator, and no specific reference was made to the variation clause.
   - Pyrotechnics Ltd carried out the work under a direct instruction outside the contract.
   - Pyrotechnics Ltd did not comply with the instruction without objection; they stated the additional work would cost £5,000.

   Therefore, Pyrotechnics Ltd is entitled to reasonable remuneration on the basis of an implied reasonable price under a separate contract for the £5,000.

2. E. Bon Building Materials Company Limited v Walland Enterprises Limited:
   - There was an existing contract between Pyrotechnics Ltd and Gabrielle and Zolt to pay an agreed sum of £80,000.
   - The work to relocate the drains was not included in the original contract sum.
   - The work to relocate the drains was necessary to comply with building regulations, making it 'indispensably necessary'.

   However, since the work was outside the original contract, Pyrotechnics Ltd can recover extra payment for it.

### Conclusion:

Pyrotechnics Ltd can bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains as it was outside the original contract and they did not comply with the instruction without objection. Additionally, Pyrotechnics Ltd can also bring an action to recover the promised bonus of £3,000 as it was a separate agreement made to ensure the project stayed on schedule.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (MINMETALS CONDO (HONG KONG) ENGINEERING CO LTD v. COLMAT CONSTRUCTION AND ENGINEERING CO LTD)

In the case of MINMETALS CONDO (HONG KONG) ENGINEERING CO LTD v. COLMAT CONSTRUCTION AND ENGINEERING CO LTD [2021] HKCFI 2184; HCCT 37/2018 (precedent p), the court ruled that ambiguous references to main contract documents or terms are more likely to be aimed at the technical descriptions of the subcontract work rather than at the contractual or legal provisions in the main contract documentation. Even where the main contract conditions are incorporated, the sub-contract conditions will generally take precedence over the main contract conditions on any point where there is some irreconcilable difference between the two on a point expressly addressed in the sub-contract.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in MINMETALS CONDO (HONG KONG) ENGINEERING CO LTD v. COLMAT CONSTRUCTION AND ENGINEERING CO LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Ambiguity in Contract Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In MINMETALS, there was ambiguity regarding whether the term "Main Contract Works" referred to the main contract or the subcontract. Similarly, in our current case, there is ambiguity regarding whether the additional work on the drains was included in the original contract or should be considered a variation.

- **Legal Concept 2: Incorporation of Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In MINMETALS, the court found that mere references to conditions in the main contract were insufficient to incorporate those conditions into the subcontract. In our current case, Gabrielle argues that the additional work on the drains should be absorbed by Pyrotechnics Ltd as part of the original project, implying an incorporation of terms without clear agreement.

- **Legal Concept 3: Precedence of Specific Contract Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In MINMETALS, the court held that sub-contract conditions take precedence over main contract conditions in case of irreconcilable differences. In our current case, the specific agreement to pay a bonus for timely completion and the additional cost for the drains should take precedence over any general terms in the original contract.

- **Legal Concept 4: Clear Intention to Incorporate Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In MINMETALS, the court emphasized the need for a clear and precise intention to incorporate terms. In our current case, there was a clear and precise agreement for the additional £5,000 for the drains and the £3,000 bonus, which should be honored.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (MINMETALS CONDO (HONG KONG) ENGINEERING CO LTD v. COLMAT CONSTRUCTION AND ENGINEERING CO LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see ambiguity in contract terms and a lack of clear intention to incorporate additional terms, the court should decide that the specific terms agreed upon by the parties take precedence. This rule was justified in MINMETALS CONDO (HONG KONG) ENGINEERING CO LTD v. COLMAT CONSTRUCTION AND ENGINEERING CO LTD because it ensures that parties are not bound by vague and ambiguous terms that were not clearly agreed upon, thereby upholding the principles of contractual clarity and fairness.

Applying this rule to our current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd should be able to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000, as these were specific terms agreed upon by the parties and should take precedence over any ambiguous or general terms in the original contract.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (MINMETALS CONDO (HONG KONG) ENGINEERING CO LTD v. COLMAT CONSTRUCTION AND ENGINEERING CO LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Ambiguity in Contract Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In MINMETALS, there was ambiguity regarding whether the term "Main Contract Works" referred to the main contract or the subcontract. Similarly, in our current case, there is ambiguity regarding whether the additional work on the drains was included in the original contract or should be considered a variation.

- **Legal Concept 2: Incorporation of Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In MINMETALS, the court found that mere references to conditions in the main contract were insufficient to incorporate those conditions into the subcontract. In our current case, Gabrielle argues that the additional work on the drains should be absorbed by Pyrotechnics Ltd as part of the original project, implying an incorporation of terms without clear agreement.

- **Legal Concept 3: Precedence of Specific Contract Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In MINMETALS, the court held that sub-contract conditions take precedence over main contract conditions in case of irreconcilable differences. In our current case, the specific agreement to pay a bonus for timely completion and the additional cost for the drains should take precedence over any general terms in the original contract.

- **Legal Concept 4: Clear Intention to Incorporate Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In MINMETALS, the court emphasized the need for a clear and precise intention to incorporate terms. In our current case, there was a clear and precise agreement for the additional £5,000 for the drains and the £3,000 bonus, which should be honored.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in MINMETALS CONDO (HONG KONG) ENGINEERING CO LTD v. COLMAT CONSTRUCTION AND ENGINEERING CO LTD. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Contractual Clarity and Fairness**: By ensuring that only clearly agreed-upon terms are enforceable, the court would promote transparency and fairness in contractual relationships. This prevents parties from being bound by vague and ambiguous terms that were not clearly agreed upon.

2. **Encouraging Precise Contract Drafting**: This outcome would incentivize parties to draft their contracts with precision and clarity, reducing the likelihood of disputes arising from ambiguous terms.

3. **Protecting Legitimate Expectations**: By enforcing the specific terms agreed upon by the parties, the court would protect the legitimate expectations of the parties, ensuring that they receive what they bargained for.

4. **Preventing Unjust Enrichment**: Allowing Pyrotechnics Ltd to recover the additional £5,000 and the £3,000 bonus would prevent Gabrielle from being unjustly enriched at the expense of Pyrotechnics Ltd, who incurred additional costs and efforts to meet the agreed-upon terms.

Therefore, applying the rule from the precedent case to our current case would uphold the principles of contractual clarity, fairness, and the protection of legitimate expectations, while preventing unjust enrichment.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case MINMETALS CONDO (HONG KONG) ENGINEERING CO LTD v. COLMAT CONSTRUCTION AND ENGINEERING CO LTD, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of clear and precise terms in the sub-contract that took precedence over the main contract conditions. This clarity was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—such as upholding contractual clarity and fairness—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it prevented parties from being bound by vague and ambiguous terms that were not clearly agreed upon. However, in our current case, this crucial clarity in the sub-contract terms is notably absent. The original contract between Gabrielle, Zolt, and Pyrotechnics Ltd did not clearly specify whether additional work required to comply with building regulations would be covered by the original quote, leading to ambiguity and dispute.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—Gabrielle's financial hardship and Zolt's disappearance—that was not present in MINMETALS CONDO (HONG KONG) ENGINEERING CO LTD v. COLMAT CONSTRUCTION AND ENGINEERING CO LTD. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces an element of financial incapacity and potential bad faith in the settlement agreement. Due to Gabrielle's financial hardship and Zolt's disappearance, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as unjustly enriching Gabrielle at the expense of Pyrotechnics Ltd and potentially encouraging parties to evade their contractual obligations by claiming financial incapacity, unlike in MINMETALS CONDO (HONG KONG) ENGINEERING CO LTD v. COLMAT CONSTRUCTION AND ENGINEERING CO LTD. This distinction suggests that the court should consider the specific circumstances and potential bad faith in the current case, which were not factors in the precedent case.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from MINMETALS CONDO (HONG KONG) ENGINEERING CO LTD v. COLMAT CONSTRUCTION AND ENGINEERING CO LTD should be stated as 'When both [ambiguity in contract terms] and [clear and precise agreement on specific terms] are present, the court should decide [that the specific terms take precedence and are enforceable].' Omitting [clear and precise agreement on specific terms] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q], which is the enforcement of vague and ambiguous terms that were not clearly agreed upon, thereby undermining contractual clarity and fairness. Indeed, the opinion in MINMETALS CONDO (HONG KONG) ENGINEERING CO LTD v. COLMAT CONSTRUCTION AND ENGINEERING CO LTD explicitly states that [a clear and precise intention to incorporate terms] was crucial to their decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in MINMETALS CONDO (HONG KONG) ENGINEERING CO LTD v. COLMAT CONSTRUCTION AND ENGINEERING CO LTD was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties being bound by vague and ambiguous terms that were not clearly agreed upon]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [this undesirable consequence] occurring because the specific terms regarding the additional £5,000 for the drains and the £3,000 bonus were clearly and precisely agreed upon by the parties. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the clear and precise agreement on specific terms (factor m), which was present in the precedent case MINMETALS CONDO (HONG KONG) ENGINEERING CO LTD v. COLMAT CONSTRUCTION AND ENGINEERING CO LTD, requiring this factor for all similar cases of ambiguity in contract terms and incorporation of terms would lead to the undesirable consequence of parties being able to evade their contractual obligations by exploiting ambiguities. Conversely, not requiring the clear and precise agreement on specific terms would allow for the enforcement of the legitimate expectations of the parties, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, such as fairness, transparency, and the protection of legitimate contractual expectations.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the clear and precise agreement on specific terms (factor m), which was present in MINMETALS CONDO (HONG KONG) ENGINEERING CO LTD v. COLMAT CONSTRUCTION AND ENGINEERING CO LTD, we have the additional factor of Gabrielle and Zolt's specific promise to pay a bonus for timely completion and the additional cost for the drains (factor n). This factor n, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of ambiguity in contract terms and the need for incorporation of terms (fact pattern i*), serves a similar function to the clear and precise agreement on specific terms in the precedent case. Given the presence of this specific promise, we submit that the reasoning in MINMETALS CONDO (HONG KONG) ENGINEERING CO LTD v. COLMAT CONSTRUCTION AND ENGINEERING CO LTD still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as fairness, transparency, and the protection of legitimate contractual expectations would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to MINMETALS CONDO (HONG KONG) ENGINEERING CO LTD v. COLMAT CONSTRUCTION AND ENGINEERING CO LTD, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as ambiguity in contract terms and the need for clear and precise agreement on specific terms. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of clear and precise terms in the original contract and the financial hardship and potential bad faith on the part of Gabrielle.

The proposed legal rule of prioritizing specific terms agreed upon by the parties over ambiguous or general terms finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the need for contractual clarity and fairness (as emphasized in the precedent) and the unique circumstances of financial hardship and potential bad faith in the current case.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, transparency, and the protection of legitimate contractual expectations, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Pyrotechnics Ltd should be able to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000. This decision aligns with the precedent's emphasis on clear and precise terms while also addressing the specific circumstances of the current case, ensuring that Gabrielle and Zolt cannot evade their contractual obligations through ambiguity and financial incapacity claims.

Therefore, the court should rule in favor of Pyrotechnics Ltd, allowing them to bring an action to recover the additional £5,000 for the drains and the £3,000 bonus, as these were specific terms agreed upon by the parties and should take precedence over any ambiguous or general terms in the original contract. This decision upholds the principles of contractual clarity, fairness, and the protection of legitimate expectations, while preventing unjust enrichment.


# Contract Law: Whether the acceptance of £40,000 in full and final settlement can be challenged on the grounds of lack of consideration for the additional work and bonus

### Minor Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3:
   - Pyrotechnics Ltd performed additional work (relocating the drains) and rescheduled other work, paying their staff overtime to ensure the project was completed on time.
   - Gabrielle and Zolt obtained a valuable benefit from this additional work and timely completion, as Gabrizo opened on schedule.
   - Therefore, Pyrotechnics Ltd can recover a sum not exceeding the value of the benefit obtained by Gabrielle and Zolt, as the court considers just.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 4:
   - The court, in estimating the amount of expenses incurred by Pyrotechnics Ltd, may include reasonable sums for overhead expenses and work or services performed personally by Pyrotechnics Ltd's staff.
   - This would include the additional £5,000 for the drain work and the overtime paid to staff.

3. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 5:
   - The court, in considering whether any sum ought to be recovered by Pyrotechnics Ltd, shall not take into account any sums payable under any contract of insurance unless there was an obligation to insure imposed by an express term of the frustrated contract or by or under any enactment.
   - There is no indication of any insurance payments or obligations in this scenario.

### Conclusion:

Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsections 3 and 4 apply. Pyrotechnics Ltd can bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000, as these sums represent the value of the benefit obtained by Gabrielle and Zolt and reasonable expenses incurred by Pyrotechnics Ltd.

   Conditions:
   - There is a mutual agreement among creditors to forgo part of their claims.
   - The agreement is made orally or in writing, or partly orally and partly in writing.
   - The agreement provides a practical solution to a real problem.
   - The mutual agreement among the creditors constitutes good consideration.

   - The other party agrees to provide additional payment or credit facility to ensure the completion of the contract.
   - The agreement is not made purely as an act of kindness but for commercial reasons.

   Consequences:
   - There is sufficient consideration to find a new contract between the parties.

   Exceptions:
   - The promise is given as a result of economic duress or fraud.

### Minor Premise:

1. Chiu Wing Hang v B.G. Lighting Co. Ltd:
   - Pyrotechnics Ltd and Gabrielle (acting on behalf of herself and Zolt) had a mutual agreement to forgo part of the claims (i.e., the additional £5,000 for the drains and the £3,000 bonus).
   - The agreement was made orally when Gabrielle informed Pyrotechnics Ltd that the £40,000 must be taken in full and final settlement.
   - The agreement provided a practical solution to a real problem, as Pyrotechnics Ltd was being pressed by their own creditors.
   - The mutual agreement among the creditors (Pyrotechnics Ltd and Gabrielle) constitutes good consideration as Pyrotechnics Ltd agreed to forgo the additional £8,000 in exchange for immediate payment of the £40,000.

   Therefore, the agreement is binding and enforceable unless void under specific statutory provisions, which is not applicable here.

2. SKK (Hong Kong) Co Ltd v Hon Fung Engineering Limited:
   - Pyrotechnics Ltd found it financially unviable to proceed without additional payment for the drain work (£5,000).
   - Gabrielle and Zolt agreed to provide an additional payment of £5,000 and a bonus of £3,000 to ensure the completion of the contract on time.
   - The agreement was made for commercial reasons, as Gabrielle and Zolt were keen to open on time.

   Therefore, there is sufficient consideration to find a new contract between the parties unless the promise was given as a result of economic duress or fraud, which is not indicated in the scenario.

### Conclusion:

Pyrotechnics Ltd can bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000. The acceptance of £40,000 in full and final settlement can be challenged on the grounds that there was sufficient consideration for the additional work and bonus, and the agreement to forgo the additional £8,000 was made under financial pressure, not as a voluntary and binding settlement.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD)

In the case of WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD [2024] HKCFI 45; HCCT 57/2020 (precedent p), Wah Sung Construction & Piling Ltd (Wah Sung) was engaged by Cheerwide Ltd (Cheerwide) to perform certain construction works. During the project, additional works were instructed by the architect, Alliance, which were outside the original contract scope. Wah Sung completed these additional works and sought payment. Cheerwide contested the payment, arguing that the additional works were part of the original contract. The court ruled that Wah Sung was entitled to payment for the additional works as they were outside the original contract scope and were instructed by the architect with authority. The court also ruled that Wah Sung was entitled to 95% of the contract sum as claimed.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Additional Works Outside Original Contract Scope**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In WAH SUNG, additional works were instructed that were outside the original contract scope. In our current case, the relocation of drains was an additional work outside the original £80,000 contract scope.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Authority to Instruct Additional Works**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In WAH SUNG, the architect had the authority to instruct additional works. In our current case, Gabrielle and Zolt agreed to the additional work and the bonus, thereby authorizing Pyrotechnics Ltd to proceed.

- **Legal Concept 3: Payment for Additional Works**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In WAH SUNG, Wah Sung was entitled to payment for additional works outside the original contract. In our current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd seeks payment for the additional £5,000 for the drain relocation.

- **Legal Concept 4: Full and Final Settlement**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In WAH SUNG, the court considered the scope of the contract and additional works in determining the entitlement to payment. In our current case, Gabrielle's claim that the £40,000 is in full and final settlement is contested by Pyrotechnics Ltd, who argue that the additional works and bonus were agreed upon separately.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see **fact pattern i*** (additional works outside the original contract scope authorized by the employer), the court should decide **outcome o** (the contractor is entitled to payment for the additional works and any agreed bonuses). This rule was justified in WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring contractors are fairly compensated for additional work and maintaining the integrity of contractual agreements outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potential disputes over what constitutes additional work.

Applying this rule to our current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd should be entitled to recover the £5,000 for the drain relocation and the £3,000 bonus. The additional work was outside the original contract scope, and Gabrielle and Zolt authorized it. The agreement to pay a bonus for timely completion further supports Pyrotechnics Ltd's claim. Therefore, the acceptance of £40,000 in full and final settlement can be challenged on the grounds of lack of consideration for the additional work and bonus.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Additional Works Outside Original Contract Scope**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In WAH SUNG, additional works were instructed that were outside the original contract scope. In our current case, the relocation of drains was an additional work outside the original £80,000 contract scope.

- **Legal Concept 2: Authority to Instruct Additional Works**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In WAH SUNG, the architect had the authority to instruct additional works. In our current case, Gabrielle and Zolt agreed to the additional work and the bonus, thereby authorizing Pyrotechnics Ltd to proceed.

- **Legal Concept 3: Payment for Additional Works**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In WAH SUNG, Wah Sung was entitled to payment for additional works outside the original contract. In our current case, Pyrotechnics Ltd seeks payment for the additional £5,000 for the drain relocation.

- **Legal Concept 4: Full and Final Settlement**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In WAH SUNG, the court considered the scope of the contract and additional works in determining the entitlement to payment. In our current case, Gabrielle's claim that the £40,000 is in full and final settlement is contested by Pyrotechnics Ltd, who argue that the additional works and bonus were agreed upon separately.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome: Pyrotechnics Ltd should be entitled to recover the £5,000 for the drain relocation and the £3,000 bonus. This decision would be justified because, as in WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Fair Compensation for Contractors**: Ensuring that contractors are fairly compensated for additional work that was not part of the original contract scope maintains the integrity of contractual agreements and encourages contractors to undertake necessary additional work without fear of non-payment.

2. **Upholding Contractual Agreements**: Recognizing the authority of the parties to agree on additional works and bonuses reinforces the principle that parties are bound by their agreements, promoting certainty and reliability in commercial transactions.

3. **Preventing Unjust Enrichment**: Allowing Gabrielle to avoid paying for the additional work and the agreed bonus would result in unjust enrichment, as she would benefit from the additional work without compensating Pyrotechnics Ltd for their efforts and expenses.

4. **Encouraging Good Faith in Contract Performance**: By holding parties accountable to their agreements, the court promotes good faith and fair dealing in the performance of contracts, which is a fundamental principle in contract law.

Therefore, the acceptance of £40,000 in full and final settlement can be challenged on the grounds of lack of consideration for the additional work and bonus. Pyrotechnics Ltd should be entitled to recover the additional £5,000 for the drain relocation and the £3,000 bonus as per the agreement with Gabrielle and Zolt.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of **an architect's authority to instruct additional works**. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as fair compensation for contractors and upholding contractual agreements, outweighed any potential drawbacks because the architect's authority provided a clear basis for the additional works being outside the original contract scope. However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as there is no mention of an independent third party, such as an architect, who had the authority to instruct the additional works. Instead, the additional works and bonus were agreed upon directly between Gabrielle, Zolt, and Pyrotechnics Ltd.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor **(the financial distress and subsequent agreement under duress)** that was not present in **WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because Pyrotechnics Ltd agreed to accept the £40,000 in full and final settlement under financial pressure from their own creditors. Due to this financial distress and the agreement made under duress, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the principle of fair bargaining and potentially encouraging exploitative practices, unlike in **WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD** where the agreement on additional works was made without such financial pressure. Therefore, the presence of financial distress and duress in our current case significantly impacts the fairness and voluntariness of the settlement agreement.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from **WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD** should be stated as: "When both [i*] (additional works outside the original contract scope authorized by the employer) and [m] (the presence of an independent third party, such as an architect, with authority to instruct additional works) are present, the court should decide [o] (the contractor is entitled to payment for the additional works and any agreed bonuses)." Omitting [m] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q] (undermining the principle of fair bargaining and potentially encouraging exploitative practices). Indeed, the opinion in **WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD** explicitly states that the architect's authority was crucial to their decision, as it provided a clear basis for the additional works being outside the original contract scope.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in **WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD** was clearly designed to prevent [undesirable consequence u] (unjust enrichment of the employer by avoiding payment for additional works that were necessary and authorized). However, in our current case, there's no risk of [u] occurring because the additional works and bonus were directly agreed upon by Gabrielle and Zolt, who were the employers themselves, without the involvement of an independent third party like an architect. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The financial distress and duress under which Pyrotechnics Ltd agreed to the £40,000 settlement further distinguish this case, highlighting the need for a different approach to ensure fair compensation and prevent exploitative practices.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction

While it's true that our case lacks the presence of an independent third party, such as an architect, with authority to instruct additional works (factor m), which was present in the precedent case WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD, requiring this factor for all similar cases of additional works outside the original contract scope authorized by the employer (fact pattern i*) would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would undermine the principle of fair compensation for contractors who undertake additional work based on direct agreements with the employers. Conversely, not requiring the presence of an independent third party would allow for a more equitable outcome, ensuring that contractors are compensated for additional work and bonuses agreed upon directly with the employers. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which emphasize the importance of honoring agreements and ensuring fair dealing between parties.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution

Although our case lacks the presence of an independent third party, such as an architect, with authority to instruct additional works (factor m), which was present in WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD, we have the additional factor of financial distress and duress under which Pyrotechnics Ltd agreed to the £40,000 settlement (factor n). This financial distress and duress, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of additional works outside the original contract scope authorized by the employer (fact pattern i*), serve a similar function to the architect's authority in the precedent case. Given the presence of financial distress and duress, we submit that the reasoning in WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD still applies, as the positive effects on ensuring fair compensation for contractors and preventing exploitative practices would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. Therefore, Pyrotechnics Ltd should be entitled to recover the additional £5,000 for the drain relocation and the £3,000 bonus as per the agreement with Gabrielle and Zolt.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of additional works outside the original contract scope authorized by the employer and the expectation of payment for these additional works. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of an independent third party, such as an architect, with authority to instruct additional works, and the financial distress and duress under which Pyrotechnics Ltd agreed to the £40,000 settlement.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case, which entitles the contractor to payment for additional works and any agreed bonuses when these works are outside the original contract scope and authorized by the employer, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the financial distress and duress present in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the additional works and bonus were directly agreed upon by Gabrielle and Zolt, thereby authorizing Pyrotechnics Ltd to proceed, and the counterargument that the acceptance of £40,000 in full and final settlement was made under financial pressure, which could undermine the principle of fair bargaining.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fair compensation for contractors, upholding contractual agreements, and preventing unjust enrichment, we conclude that Pyrotechnics Ltd should be entitled to recover the additional £5,000 for the drain relocation and the £3,000 bonus. This decision aligns with the legal precedent set in **WAH SUNG CONSTRUCTION & PILING LTD v. CHEERWIDE LTD** and serves justice by ensuring that contractors are fairly compensated for additional work authorized by the employer, even in the absence of an independent third party's authority. The financial distress and duress under which the settlement was agreed further support the need for a fair resolution that prevents exploitative practices.

Therefore, Pyrotechnics Ltd can bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000.
