### Legal Analysis of the Scenario

#### Legal Issues
1. **Contractual Obligation for Additional Work**: Whether Pyrotechnics Ltd can claim the additional £5,000 for the work on the drains.
2. **Enforceability of the Bonus Agreement**: Whether Pyrotechnics Ltd can claim the £3,000 bonus promised by Gabrielle and Zolt for completing the work on time.
3. **Full and Final Settlement**: Whether the acceptance of £40,000 as full and final settlement precludes Pyrotechnics Ltd from claiming the additional amounts.

#### Applicable Laws
1. **Contract Law**: The principles of contract formation, modification, and consideration.
2. **Doctrine of Accord and Satisfaction**: The legal effect of accepting a lesser sum in full and final settlement of a debt.
3. **Case Law**: Relevant case law on contract modifications and the enforceability of promises for additional payments.

#### Application of Law to Facts

1. **Contractual Obligation for Additional Work**
   - **Initial Contract**: The original contract was for £80,000, which did not include the additional work on the drains.
   - **Modification of Contract**: The additional work on the drains was agreed upon for an extra £5,000. This constitutes a variation of the original contract.
   - **Consideration**: The additional £5,000 can be seen as valid consideration for the extra work required to comply with building regulations.
   - **Legal Precedent**: In the case of *Williams v Roffey Bros & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd* [1991] 1 QB 1, the court held that a promise to pay extra for additional work can be enforceable if it confers a practical benefit to the promisor. Here, the practical benefit to Gabrielle and Zolt was the compliance with building regulations and the timely opening of their business.

2. **Enforceability of the Bonus Agreement**
   - **Promise of Bonus**: Gabrielle and Zolt promised a £3,000 bonus if the work stayed on schedule.
   - **Consideration**: Pyrotechnics Ltd rescheduled other work and paid their staff overtime, which constitutes valid consideration for the bonus.
   - **Legal Precedent**: The principle from *Williams v Roffey Bros* can also apply here, as the promise of a bonus provided a practical benefit to Gabrielle and Zolt by ensuring the timely opening of Gabrizo.

3. **Full and Final Settlement**
   - **Accord and Satisfaction**: Gabrielle's payment of £40,000 as full and final settlement and Pyrotechnics Ltd's acceptance of it could be seen as an accord and satisfaction.
   - **Economic Duress**: Pyrotechnics Ltd accepted the £40,000 under financial pressure from their own creditors, which could be argued as economic duress, potentially invalidating the accord and satisfaction.
   - **Legal Precedent**: In *Foakes v Beer* [1884] UKHL 1, the House of Lords held that part payment of a debt is not good consideration for the discharge of the entire debt unless there is some new consideration. Here, there was no new consideration provided by Gabrielle for the discharge of the additional £8,000.

#### Conclusion
Based on the above analysis, Pyrotechnics Ltd has a strong case to bring an action to recover the additional £5,000 for the work on the drains and the £3,000 bonus:

1. **Additional £5,000 for Drains**: The additional work was a variation of the original contract with valid consideration. Pyrotechnics Ltd can claim this amount.
2. **£3,000 Bonus**: The promise of a bonus was supported by valid consideration and conferred a practical benefit to Gabrielle and Zolt. Pyrotechnics Ltd can claim this amount.
3. **Full and Final Settlement**: The acceptance of £40,000 under economic duress may invalidate the accord and satisfaction, allowing Pyrotechnics Ltd to claim the remaining amounts.

Pyrotechnics Ltd should proceed with legal action to recover the £8,000 owed.
