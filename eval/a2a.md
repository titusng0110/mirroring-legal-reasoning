### Legal Analysis of the Scenario

#### 1. Identification of Legal Issues

The scenario presents several potential legal issues related to misrepresentation in the sale of a business:

1. **Misrepresentation of Turnover**: Lillabeth stated that the turnover of the café is £100,000, with specific amounts attributed to café sales, art sales, and rentals. Rufus later discovers that the total turnover had never exceeded £50,000.
2. **Non-disclosure of Artists' Relocation**: Lillabeth did not disclose that the artists had moved their workspaces to the local village hall, which could affect the attractiveness and value of the café.
3. **Impact of the Bypass**: The construction of a bypass around Little Butte, which occurred between Rufus seeing the café and signing the contract, has led to a significant reduction in passing trade.

#### 2. Applicable Laws

The applicable laws in this scenario include:

1. **Misrepresentation Ordinance (Cap. 284)**: This ordinance governs the law relating to misrepresentations in Hong Kong.
2. **Common Law Principles of Misrepresentation**: These principles are derived from case law and include fraudulent, negligent, and innocent misrepresentation.
3. **Relevant Case Law**:
   - **Redgrave v Hurd (1881) 20 Ch D 1**: Establishes that a person induced to enter into a contract by a material misrepresentation is entitled to rescind the contract, even if they had the means to discover the truth.
   - **Derry v Peek (1889) 14 App Cas 337**: Defines fraudulent misrepresentation as a false representation made knowingly, without belief in its truth, or recklessly.
   - **HCA 505/2012 (Li Cho Kwan v Oliveiro Lana)**: Discusses the distinction between actionable misrepresentations and statements of opinion or sales talk.

#### 3. Application of Law to Facts

**Misrepresentation of Turnover**:
- **Legal Issue**: Lillabeth's statement that the turnover is £100,000, when in fact it had never exceeded £50,000, constitutes a false representation of a material fact.
- **Applicable Law**: Under the Misrepresentation Ordinance (Cap. 284), Section 3(1), if a person enters into a contract after a misrepresentation and suffers loss, the person making the misrepresentation is liable for damages as if the misrepresentation were made fraudulently, unless they can prove they had reasonable grounds to believe it was true.
- **Analysis**: Lillabeth's statement about the turnover is a clear misrepresentation. Rufus relied on this information when deciding to purchase the café. Given that the actual turnover is significantly lower, Rufus has suffered a financial loss. Lillabeth would need to prove that she had reasonable grounds to believe the turnover was £100,000, which seems unlikely given the substantial discrepancy.

**Non-disclosure of Artists' Relocation**:
- **Legal Issue**: Lillabeth did not disclose that the artists had moved their workspaces, which could affect the café's attractiveness and value.
- **Applicable Law**: While non-disclosure alone does not typically constitute misrepresentation, it can be actionable if it distorts a positive representation (Farrand on Contract and Conveyance).
- **Analysis**: Lillabeth's failure to disclose the artists' relocation could be seen as a material fact that Rufus would have considered important. This non-disclosure, combined with the misrepresentation of turnover, strengthens Rufus's case for rescission or damages.

**Impact of the Bypass**:
- **Legal Issue**: The construction of a bypass has reduced passing trade, affecting the café's business.
- **Applicable Law**: Generally, changes in circumstances after a contract is signed do not constitute misrepresentation unless there was a duty to disclose such potential changes.
- **Analysis**: The bypass construction occurred after Rufus saw the café but before signing the contract. If Lillabeth was aware of the planned bypass and its potential impact, she may have had a duty to disclose this information. However, if she was unaware, this may not constitute misrepresentation.

#### Conclusion

Rufus has a strong potential claim against Lillabeth for misrepresentation based on the false statement about the turnover. This misrepresentation is actionable under the Misrepresentation Ordinance (Cap. 284), and Rufus may seek rescission of the contract or damages. The non-disclosure of the artists' relocation further supports his claim. The impact of the bypass is less clear-cut but could be relevant if Lillabeth was aware of it and failed to disclose it. Rufus should seek legal advice to pursue his claim and potentially rescind the contract or seek compensation for his losses.
