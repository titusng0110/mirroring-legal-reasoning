### Legal Analysis of the Scenario

#### 1. Identification of Legal Issues

The primary legal issues in this scenario revolve around potential misrepresentation by Lillabeth in the sale of the Artists’ Refuge Café to Rufus. Specifically, the issues are:

1. **Misrepresentation of Turnover**: Lillabeth claimed the turnover was £100,000 p.a., but Rufus later discovered it had never exceeded £50,000.
2. **Non-disclosure of Artists' Relocation**: Lillabeth did not inform Rufus that the artists had moved to the local village hall.
3. **Impact of the Bypass**: The construction of a bypass around Little Butte, which significantly reduced passing trade, was not disclosed.

#### 2. Applicable Laws

The relevant legal principles and laws applicable to this scenario include:

1. **Misrepresentation**: Under common law, misrepresentation is a false statement of fact made by one party to another, which induces the latter to enter into a contract. Misrepresentation can be:
   - **Fraudulent**: Made knowingly, without belief in its truth, or recklessly.
   - **Negligent**: Made carelessly or without reasonable grounds for believing its truth.
   - **Innocent**: Made without fault.

2. **Hong Kong Misrepresentation Ordinance (Cap. 284)**: This Ordinance governs the remedies available for misrepresentation, including rescission and damages.

3. **Case Law**:
   - **Derry v Peek (1889)**: Defines fraudulent misrepresentation.
   - **Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd (1964)**: Establishes the principle of negligent misrepresentation.
   - **Redgrave v Hurd (1881)**: Addresses the issue of reliance on misrepresentation despite the opportunity to verify the facts.

#### 3. Application of Law to Facts

**Misrepresentation of Turnover**:
- **False Statement of Fact**: Lillabeth stated that the turnover was £100,000 p.a., but it was actually never more than £50,000.
- **Inducement**: Rufus relied on this statement when deciding to purchase the café.
- **Type of Misrepresentation**: Given that Lillabeth provided specific figures, it is likely she knew or should have known the true turnover. This could be classified as either fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation.

**Non-disclosure of Artists' Relocation**:
- **Material Fact**: The relocation of the artists is a material fact as it affects the rental income and the attractiveness of the café.
- **Duty to Disclose**: While silence is not generally misrepresentation, non-disclosure of a material fact that affects the value of the business can be considered misrepresentation if it creates a false impression.

**Impact of the Bypass**:
- **Change in Circumstances**: The construction of the bypass significantly reduced passing trade, which is a material change affecting the business.
- **Duty to Disclose**: If Lillabeth was aware of the bypass and its potential impact, her failure to disclose this information could be considered misrepresentation.

**Reliance and Opportunity to Verify**:
- **Redgrave v Hurd**: Rufus had the opportunity to verify the turnover figures by inspecting the account books but chose not to due to their condition. However, reliance on Lillabeth's statements despite the opportunity to verify does not negate the misrepresentation.

#### Conclusion

Rufus has a potential claim against Lillabeth for misrepresentation based on the following grounds:

1. **Fraudulent or Negligent Misrepresentation of Turnover**: Lillabeth's statement about the turnover was false and likely made knowingly or negligently.
2. **Non-disclosure of Material Facts**: Lillabeth's failure to disclose the artists' relocation and the impact of the bypass constitutes misrepresentation.

Rufus can seek remedies under the Misrepresentation Ordinance, including rescission of the contract and/or damages. Given the severity of the misrepresentation, particularly regarding the turnover, Rufus has a strong case for rescission and potentially damages for any losses incurred.
