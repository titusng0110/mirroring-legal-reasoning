   - The representee did not rely on the statement
   - The false statement was not material to the decision of the representee

2. Green Park Properties Limited v Dorku Limited

   Conditions:
   - A false statement was made which was likely to induce the contract
   - The representee entered the contract
   - The misrepresentation operated on the mind of the representee

   Consequences:
   - The representee is entitled to rescind the contract

   Exceptions:
   - The court exercises its discretion under section 3(2) of the Misrepresentation Ordinance to declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission, having regard to the nature of the misrepresentation and the loss that would be caused by it if the contract were upheld, as well as to the loss that rescission would cause to the other party

### Minor Premise:

1. TOP FAITH PROPERTY LTD v. WONG BEN AND OTHERS [2022] HKCA 783:
- Lillabeth made a statement to Rufus in the context of a transaction (sale of the café).
- The statement about the turnover of £100,000 was false.
- Rufus was induced by the false statement to enter into the transaction.
- The false statement was material to Rufus's decision to purchase the café.

   However:
   - Rufus had the opportunity to verify the statement by checking the account books but chose not to.
   - Therefore, this exception applies, and Rufus may not be entitled to rescind the transaction under this case law.

2. Green Park Properties Limited v Dorku Limited:
- A false statement about the turnover was made, which was likely to induce the contract.
- Rufus entered the contract.
- The misrepresentation operated on the mind of Rufus.

   However:
   - The court may exercise its discretion under section 3(2) of the Misrepresentation Ordinance to declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission, considering the nature of the misrepresentation and the losses involved.

### Conclusion:

Rufus has a potential claim against Lillabeth on the grounds of misrepresentation. However, due to the exception that Rufus had the opportunity to verify the statement but chose not to, he may not be entitled to rescind the transaction under TOP FAITH PROPERTY LTD v. WONG BEN AND OTHERS [2022] HKCA 783. Under Green Park Properties Limited v Dorku Limited, the court may declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission, considering the nature of the misrepresentation and the losses involved.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS [2019] HKCFI 65; HCA 215/2015)

In the case of CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS [2019] HKCFI 65; HCA 215/2015 (precedent p), the plaintiffs (Chan and Wife) alleged that they were induced to enter into a 2012 Agreement and a Contract based on fraudulent misrepresentations made by the defendants (Irene, the Son, and the Daughter). The court ruled that the plaintiffs failed to establish that the alleged misrepresentations induced the 2012 Agreement or the Contract. The court emphasized that serious allegations of fraud and misrepresentation must be supported by clear facts and evidence, and the standard of proof is commensurate with the gravity of the allegations.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Misrepresentation**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the plaintiffs allege that they were induced to enter into a contract based on false statements made by the defendants. In precedent p, Chan and Wife claimed that the business was free from debts and liabilities, and in the current case, Rufus was told that the turnover was £100,000.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Inducement**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: The plaintiffs in both cases must prove that the misrepresentation induced them to enter into the contract. In precedent p, the court found no evidence that the misrepresentations induced the 2012 Agreement or the Contract. In the current case, Rufus must show that he relied on the turnover statement when deciding to purchase the café.
  
- **Legal Concept 3: Standard of Proof**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: The court in precedent p emphasized that allegations of fraud and misrepresentation require a high standard of proof, commensurate with the seriousness of the allegations. Similarly, Rufus must provide clear evidence that the turnover statement was false and that he relied on it.
  
- **Legal Concept 4: Contemporaneous Documentation**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In precedent p, the court considered contemporaneous documentation to assess the reliability of the claims. In the current case, Rufus was invited to review the account books but chose not to, which may affect the assessment of his reliance on the turnover statement.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of alleged misrepresentation inducing a contract (i*), the court should decide that the plaintiff must provide clear and convincing evidence that the misrepresentation was made, was false, and induced the contract (outcome o). This rule was justified in CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS because the positive effects (E+) of requiring a high standard of proof for serious allegations like fraud and misrepresentation ensure that only well-substantiated claims succeed, thereby upholding the integrity of contractual agreements and preventing frivolous or unfounded claims. The negative effects (E-) of potentially dismissing valid claims due to insufficient evidence are outweighed by the need to maintain a rigorous standard for serious allegations.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Misrepresentation**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the plaintiffs allege that they were induced to enter into a contract based on false statements made by the defendants. In precedent p, Chan and Wife claimed that the business was free from debts and liabilities, and in the current case, Rufus was told that the turnover was £100,000.

- **Legal Concept 2: Inducement**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: The plaintiffs in both cases must prove that the misrepresentation induced them to enter into the contract. In precedent p, the court found no evidence that the misrepresentations induced the 2012 Agreement or the Contract. In the current case, Rufus must show that he relied on the turnover statement when deciding to purchase the café.

- **Legal Concept 3: Standard of Proof**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: The court in precedent p emphasized that allegations of fraud and misrepresentation require a high standard of proof, commensurate with the seriousness of the allegations. Similarly, Rufus must provide clear evidence that the turnover statement was false and that he relied on it.

- **Legal Concept 4: Contemporaneous Documentation**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In precedent p, the court considered contemporaneous documentation to assess the reliability of the claims. In the current case, Rufus was invited to review the account books but chose not to, which may affect the assessment of his reliance on the turnover statement.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding the Integrity of Contractual Agreements**: By requiring clear and convincing evidence for serious allegations like fraud and misrepresentation, the court ensures that only well-substantiated claims succeed. This upholds the integrity of contractual agreements and prevents frivolous or unfounded claims.

2. **Encouraging Due Diligence**: The decision emphasizes the importance of due diligence. Rufus had the opportunity to review the account books but chose not to. This reinforces the principle that parties must take reasonable steps to verify information before entering into contracts.

3. **Maintaining a Rigorous Standard for Serious Allegations**: The high standard of proof for serious allegations like fraud and misrepresentation ensures that such claims are not made lightly. This protects individuals and businesses from baseless accusations that could harm their reputation and financial standing.

4. **Reliance on Contemporaneous Documentation**: The decision highlights the importance of contemporaneous documentation in assessing the reliability of claims. This encourages parties to maintain accurate records and supports the use of objective evidence in legal proceedings.

In conclusion, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS, it would uphold the integrity of contractual agreements, encourage due diligence, maintain a rigorous standard for serious allegations, and emphasize the importance of contemporaneous documentation.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case

In the precedent case **CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS [2019] HKCFI 65; HCA 215/2015**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of **contemporaneous documentation**. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as upholding the integrity of contractual agreements and encouraging due diligence, outweighed any potential drawbacks because the court could rely on objective evidence to assess the reliability of the claims. However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as Rufus chose not to review the account books, which were available to him. This lack of contemporaneous documentation may weaken Rufus's ability to substantiate his claim of misrepresentation.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case

Our current case involves an important factor **(the planned bypass around Little Butte)** that was not present in **CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of alleged misrepresentation inducing a contract because the bypass has caused a substantial fall in the amount of passing trade, which directly impacts the turnover of the café. Due to the bypass, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as unfairly holding Rufus to a contract based on significantly changed circumstances that were not disclosed, unlike in **CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS** because the precedent case did not involve such a significant external change affecting the business's viability.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS [2019] HKCFI 65; HCA 215/2015** should be stated as: "When both [the fact pattern of alleged misrepresentation inducing a contract] and [the presence of contemporaneous documentation] are present, the court should decide [that the plaintiff must provide clear and convincing evidence that the misrepresentation was made, was false, and induced the contract]." Omitting [the presence of contemporaneous documentation] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of dismissing valid claims due to insufficient evidence, even when the plaintiff had no reasonable opportunity to verify the information]. Indeed, the opinion in **CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS** explicitly states that contemporaneous documentation was crucial to their decision, as it provided an objective basis to assess the reliability of the claims.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of frivolous or unfounded claims of misrepresentation and fraud]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [frivolous or unfounded claims] occurring because Rufus had no reasonable opportunity to verify the turnover information due to the condition of the account books and the significant external change (the bypass) affecting the business's viability. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the presence of contemporaneous documentation, which was present in the precedent case **CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of alleged misrepresentation inducing a contract would lead to the undesirable consequence of dismissing valid claims due to insufficient evidence, even when the plaintiff had no reasonable opportunity to verify the information. Conversely, not requiring contemporaneous documentation would allow for a more equitable assessment of claims where the plaintiff was misled and had limited means to verify the information, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and justice in contract law.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the presence of contemporaneous documentation, which was present in **CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS**, we have the additional factor of a significant external change (the planned bypass around Little Butte). This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of alleged misrepresentation inducing a contract, serves a similar function to contemporaneous documentation in the precedent case. Given the presence of the bypass, we submit that the reasoning in **CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS** still applies, as the positive effects on ensuring fairness and preventing unjust enrichment would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS [2019] HKCFI 65; HCA 215/2015**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations:

1. **Key Similarities**:
   - Both cases involve allegations of misrepresentation inducing a contract.
   - Both plaintiffs must prove that the misrepresentation induced them to enter into the contract.
   - Both cases require a high standard of proof for serious allegations like fraud and misrepresentation.

2. **Key Differences**:
   - In **CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS**, contemporaneous documentation was available and played a crucial role in the court's decision.
   - In the current case, Rufus chose not to review the account books, which were available but in poor condition.
   - The current case involves a significant external change (the planned bypass around Little Butte) that directly impacts the business's viability, which was not a factor in the precedent case.

3. **Proposed Legal Rule**:
   - The rule from the precedent case suggests that plaintiffs must provide clear and convincing evidence that the misrepresentation was made, was false, and induced the contract, especially when contemporaneous documentation is available.

4. **Weighing Arguments**:
   - **For the Rule**: The high standard of proof ensures that only well-substantiated claims succeed, upholding the integrity of contractual agreements and preventing frivolous claims.
   - **Against the Rule**: Requiring contemporaneous documentation in all cases may dismiss valid claims where the plaintiff had no reasonable opportunity to verify the information, especially when significant external changes affect the business.

5. **Relevant Legal Principles**:
   - **Misrepresentation**: A false statement of fact made by one party to another, which induces the other party to enter into a contract.
   - **Inducement**: The misrepresentation must have been a material factor in the plaintiff's decision to enter into the contract.
   - **Standard of Proof**: Serious allegations like fraud and misrepresentation require a high standard of proof, commensurate with the gravity of the allegations.

### Final Decision

Considering the underlying legal principles of misrepresentation, inducement, and the standard of proof, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Rufus has a potential claim against Lillabeth on the grounds of misrepresentation. 

**Key Factors Influencing the Outcome**:
- **Misrepresentation**: Lillabeth's statement about the turnover of £100,000 was false, as the actual turnover had never been more than £50,000.
- **Inducement**: Rufus relied on Lillabeth's statement when deciding to purchase the café, even though he chose not to review the account books due to their poor condition.
- **Significant External Change**: The planned bypass around Little Butte, which caused a substantial fall in passing trade, was a material change that Lillabeth did not disclose.

While the absence of contemporaneous documentation weakens Rufus's position, the significant external change (the bypass) and the false statement about the turnover provide sufficient grounds for a claim of misrepresentation. Therefore, the decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency.


# Contract Law: Whether Lillabeth's breakdown of the income sources (£65,000 from café sales, £30,000 from art sales, and £5,000 from rentals) constitutes a misrepresentation

   - The misrepresentation has been made to him by another party
   - He has suffered loss as a result of the misrepresentation
   - If the misrepresentation had been made fraudulently, the person making the misrepresentation would be liable to damages

   Consequences:

   Exceptions:
   - The person making the misrepresentation proves that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the facts represented were true
   - The person making the misrepresentation did believe up to the time the contract was made that the facts represented were true

2. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - A person has entered into a contract
   - He entered into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to him
   - The misrepresentation was not made to him fraudulently
   - He would be entitled, by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract
   - It is claimed in any proceedings arising out of the contract that the contract ought to be or has been rescinded
   - The court or arbitrator is of opinion that it would be equitable to do so, having regard to:
     * The nature of the misrepresentation
     * The loss that would be caused by it if the contract were upheld
     * The loss that rescission would cause to the other party

   Consequences:
   - The court or arbitrator may declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1:
- Rufus has entered into a contract with Lillabeth after a misrepresentation.
- The misrepresentation was made to him by Lillabeth.
- Rufus has suffered loss as a result of the misrepresentation, as the turnover was never more than £50,000, and the bypass has reduced passing trade.
- If Lillabeth had made the misrepresentation fraudulently, she would be liable to damages.
- Lillabeth may argue she had reasonable grounds to believe her claim was true, but given the significant discrepancy in turnover, it is unlikely she can prove she believed the facts represented were true up to the time the contract was made.
- Therefore, this section applies, and Lillabeth is liable to damages.

2. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2:
- Rufus has entered into a contract to purchase the café.
- Lillabeth's breakdown of income sources is a misrepresentation.
- Rufus entered into the contract after this misrepresentation was made to him.
- Lillabeth did not make this misrepresentation fraudulently.
- Rufus would be entitled, by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract.
- Rufus may claim in proceedings that the contract ought to be rescinded.
- Balancing the nature of the misrepresentation,
  * it is a material misrepresentation affecting the value and profitability of the café;
  * the loss that would be caused to Rufus if the contract were upheld is significant due to the lower turnover and reduced passing trade;
  * the loss that rescission would cause to Lillabeth would be the return of the purchase price and potential loss of future sale opportunities.
- Therefore, this section applies, and the court may declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission.

### Conclusion:

Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1 and 2 apply. Lillabeth is liable to damages for the misrepresentation, and the court may declare the contract subsisting and award Rufus damages in lieu of rescission.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD)

In the case of BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD (precedent p), the court ruled that Centaline, acting as an agent for both Mega Well and Bright Gold, made a misrepresentation to Mega Well regarding the property. The court found that Mega Well relied on this misrepresentation in purchasing the property, and both Centaline and Bright Gold were held liable for the misrepresentation. The court emphasized the duty of care owed by Centaline to Mega Well and the implied authority of Centaline to provide information about the property on behalf of Bright Gold.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Misrepresentation**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD, Centaline made false statements about the property to Mega Well. In our current case, Lillabeth made false statements about the turnover of the café to Rufus.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Reliance on Misrepresentation**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD, Mega Well relied on the misrepresentation in deciding to purchase the property. In our current case, Rufus relied on Lillabeth's statements about the turnover in deciding to purchase the café.
  
- **Legal Concept 3: Duty of Care**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD, Centaline owed a duty of care to Mega Well as its professional agent. In our current case, Lillabeth, as the seller, owed a duty of care to provide accurate information to Rufus, the buyer.
  
- **Legal Concept 4: Implied Authority**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD, Centaline was found to have implied authority to provide information about the property on behalf of Bright Gold. In our current case, Lillabeth, as the owner and seller of the café, had implied authority to provide information about the business to potential buyers like Rufus.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a seller or agent making a misrepresentation about a property or business, and the buyer relies on that misrepresentation in making a purchase decision, the court should hold the seller or agent liable for the misrepresentation. This rule was justified in BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD because the positive effects (E+) of holding the seller or agent accountable for providing accurate information and protecting the buyer's interests outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially discouraging sellers or agents from making representations. This rule upholds the underlying values and principles of fairness and trust in contractual relationships.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Misrepresentation**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD, Centaline made false statements about the property to Mega Well. In our current case, Lillabeth made false statements about the turnover of the café to Rufus.

- **Legal Concept 2: Reliance on Misrepresentation**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD, Mega Well relied on the misrepresentation in deciding to purchase the property. In our current case, Rufus relied on Lillabeth's statements about the turnover in deciding to purchase the café.

- **Legal Concept 3: Duty of Care**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD, Centaline owed a duty of care to Mega Well as its professional agent. In our current case, Lillabeth, as the seller, owed a duty of care to provide accurate information to Rufus, the buyer.

- **Legal Concept 4: Implied Authority**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD, Centaline was found to have implied authority to provide information about the property on behalf of Bright Gold. In our current case, Lillabeth, as the owner and seller of the café, had implied authority to provide information about the business to potential buyers like Rufus.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Protection of Buyers**: Holding Lillabeth liable for misrepresentation would protect buyers like Rufus from being misled by false information, thereby promoting fairness in commercial transactions.

2. **Encouragement of Accurate Disclosures**: Sellers would be encouraged to provide accurate and truthful information about their businesses, knowing that they could be held liable for any misrepresentations. This would enhance trust and transparency in the market.

3. **Upholding Duty of Care**: Reinforcing the duty of care owed by sellers to buyers ensures that sellers take their responsibilities seriously and act in good faith during negotiations.

4. **Deterrence of Misleading Practices**: Imposing liability for misrepresentation would deter sellers from engaging in deceptive practices, thereby maintaining the integrity of the market.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD, it would have the positive effects of protecting buyers, encouraging accurate disclosures, upholding the duty of care, and deterring misleading practices.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case

In the precedent case **BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of **professional agents (Centaline)** who were acting on behalf of both the buyer (Mega Well) and the seller (Bright Gold). This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as protecting the buyer from misrepresentation and ensuring the duty of care by professional agents, outweighed any potential drawbacks. The court found that Centaline, as a professional agent, had a duty of care and implied authority to provide accurate information, which was breached.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of **professional agents** is notably absent. Lillabeth is not a professional agent but the owner and seller of the café. The absence of a professional intermediary means that the dynamics of duty of care and reliance on professional expertise are different. Rufus was dealing directly with the seller, Lillabeth, and not through a professional agent who would have a higher standard of care and implied authority.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case

Our current case involves an important factor **(the planned bypass built around Little Butte)** that was not present in **BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of misrepresentation and reliance. The construction of the bypass has caused a substantial fall in the amount of passing trade, which directly impacts the turnover and profitability of the café.

Due to the presence of the bypass, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as unfairly holding Lillabeth liable for changes in external circumstances that she may not have foreseen or controlled. Unlike in **BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD**, where the misrepresentation was solely about the property features and not influenced by external changes, the bypass introduces a significant external factor that affects the business's turnover and Rufus's reliance on the initial representation. This external factor complicates the issue of misrepresentation and reliance, making it less straightforward to hold Lillabeth liable in the same manner as Centaline and Bright Gold were held liable in the precedent case.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from **BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD** should be stated as: "When both [misrepresentation by a professional agent] and [reliance on that misrepresentation by the buyer] are present, the court should decide [to hold the agent and the seller liable for the misrepresentation]." Omitting [the presence of a professional agent] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of holding sellers directly liable for misrepresentations without considering the role and duty of professional agents, thereby potentially discouraging sellers from making any representations and complicating direct transactions between buyers and sellers].

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in **BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of buyers being misled by professional agents who have a duty of care and implied authority to provide accurate information]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [buyers being misled by professional agents, as the transaction was directly between the buyer and the seller without any professional intermediary]. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the presence of a professional agent, which was present in the precedent case **BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of misrepresentation would lead to the undesirable consequence of limiting the protection available to buyers in direct transactions. Conversely, not requiring the presence of a professional agent would allow for a more comprehensive protection of buyers from misrepresentations made by sellers, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and trust in contractual relationships. This approach ensures that sellers are held accountable for the accuracy of the information they provide, regardless of whether a professional agent is involved.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the presence of a professional agent, which was present in **BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD**, we have the additional factor of the planned bypass built around Little Butte. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of misrepresentation and reliance, serves a similar function to the professional agent in the precedent case by significantly impacting the business's turnover and Rufus's reliance on the initial representation. Given the presence of the bypass, we submit that the reasoning in **BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD** still applies, as the positive effects on protecting buyers from misrepresentation and ensuring accurate disclosures would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. This approach ensures that sellers are held accountable for the accuracy of the information they provide, even when external factors like the bypass significantly alter the business's circumstances.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations:

**Key Similarities:**
1. **Misrepresentation**: In both cases, there was a misrepresentation made by the seller or their agent about the property or business.
2. **Reliance on Misrepresentation**: In both cases, the buyer relied on the misrepresentation in making the purchase decision.
3. **Duty of Care**: In both cases, there was a duty of care owed by the party making the representation to the buyer.

**Key Differences:**
1. **Presence of Professional Agent**: In **BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD**, the misrepresentation was made by a professional agent (Centaline), whereas in the current case, the misrepresentation was made directly by the seller (Lillabeth).
2. **External Factors**: The current case involves an external factor (the planned bypass) that significantly impacted the business's turnover, which was not present in the precedent case.

**Proposed Legal Rule:**
The proposed legal rule from the precedent case is that when both [misrepresentation by a professional agent] and [reliance on that misrepresentation by the buyer] are present, the court should decide [to hold the agent and the seller liable for the misrepresentation].

**Weighing Arguments:**
- **For Applying the Rule**: The rule protects buyers from being misled and encourages accurate disclosures, upholding fairness and trust in contractual relationships.
- **Against Applying the Rule**: The absence of a professional agent and the presence of an external factor (the bypass) complicate the issue of misrepresentation and reliance, making it less straightforward to hold Lillabeth liable in the same manner as in the precedent case.

**Relevant Legal Principles:**
- **Fairness and Trust**: Ensuring that buyers are protected from misrepresentation and that sellers provide accurate information.
- **Duty of Care**: Upholding the duty of care owed by sellers to buyers in providing accurate information.

**Final Decision:**
Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, trust, and duty of care, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Lillabeth should be held liable for the misrepresentation. The key factors influencing this decision are:

1. **Misrepresentation and Reliance**: Lillabeth made a false statement about the turnover, and Rufus relied on this statement in deciding to purchase the café.
2. **Duty of Care**: As the seller, Lillabeth owed a duty of care to provide accurate information to Rufus.
3. **External Factors**: While the bypass is an external factor, it does not absolve Lillabeth of the responsibility to provide accurate information about the business's turnover at the time of the sale.

Therefore, Rufus has a potential claim against Lillabeth on the grounds of misrepresentation, as the misrepresentation about the turnover was a significant factor in his decision to purchase the café, and Lillabeth had a duty to provide accurate information. This decision aligns with the legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency.

### Relevant law:

FACV000026A/1998

### Major Premise:

1. FACV000026A/1998

   Conditions:
   - A statement that is literally true may give a misleading impression.
   - It may imply a state of affairs that other facts would show to be false.
   - Those facts may exist at the time of the statement, in which case the statement is, upon its true construction, false at the time it is made.
   - The facts which falsify the representation may come into existence later, but before the representation has been relied upon.

   Consequences:
   - The representor is under a duty to correct what he said and not allow the other party to rely upon a statement which has become false.

   Exceptions:
   - There is no duty of disclosure, such as exists in contracts of insurance.

### Minor Premise:

1. FACV000026A/1998:
- Lillabeth placed an advertisement stating the turnover of the café is £100,000 p.a., which is literally true but gives a misleading impression.
- The statement implies a state of affairs that other facts (the actual turnover being never more than £50,000) would show to be false.
- The fact that the actual turnover is less than £100,000 existed at the time of the statement, making the statement false upon its true construction.
- The planned bypass, which caused a substantial fall in passing trade, came into existence later but before Rufus relied upon the representation.
- Lillabeth did not correct her statement and allowed Rufus to rely upon it, thus breaching her duty to correct the misleading impression.

### Conclusion:

FACV000026A/1998 applies, and Lillabeth's failure to disclose the true turnover and the impact of the bypass constitutes a misrepresentation by omission. Rufus has a potential claim against Lillabeth on the grounds of misrepresentation.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA008564/1998)
In the case of HCA008564/1998 between Green Park Properties Limited (plaintiff) and Dorku Limited (defendant) (precedent p), the court ruled that the defendant had misrepresented the property by not disclosing that the yard was not part of the property being sold. The court found that the defendant had a duty to disclose this material fact and that the misrepresentation by conduct and omission entitled the plaintiff to rescind the contract and recover the deposit.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA008564/1998 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Misrepresentation by Conduct**: In HCA008564/1998, the defendant's conduct during the property inspection led the plaintiff to believe that the yard was part of the property. Similarly, in our current case, Lillabeth's conduct in showing the café and providing turnover figures without disclosing the artists' relocation led Rufus to believe that the artists' rented workspaces were still part of the business.
  
- **Duty to Disclose Material Facts**: In HCA008564/1998, the court found that the defendant had a duty to disclose that the yard was not part of the property. In our current case, Lillabeth had a duty to disclose that the artists had moved to the local village hall, as this is a material fact that would influence Rufus's decision to purchase the café.

- **Misrepresentation by Omission**: In HCA008564/1998, the defendant's failure to disclose the true boundaries of the property constituted a misrepresentation by omission. In our current case, Lillabeth's failure to disclose the artists' relocation similarly constitutes a misrepresentation by omission.

- **Impact on Contractual Decision**: In HCA008564/1998, the misrepresentation materially influenced the plaintiff's decision to enter into the contract. In our current case, the misrepresentation about the artists' presence and the turnover figures materially influenced Rufus's decision to purchase the café.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA008564/1998)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of misrepresentation by conduct and omission regarding material facts that influence a contractual decision, the court should decide that the misled party is entitled to rescind the contract and recover any deposits made. This rule was justified in HCA008564/1998 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring transparency and fairness in contractual dealings outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially rescinding contracts. Ensuring that all material facts are disclosed upholds the principles of good faith and fair dealing in contract law.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA008564/1998) are present:

- **Misrepresentation by Conduct**: In HCA008564/1998, the defendant's conduct during the property inspection led the plaintiff to believe that the yard was part of the property. Similarly, in our current case, Lillabeth's conduct in showing the café and providing turnover figures without disclosing the artists' relocation led Rufus to believe that the artists' rented workspaces were still part of the business.

- **Duty to Disclose Material Facts**: In HCA008564/1998, the court found that the defendant had a duty to disclose that the yard was not part of the property. In our current case, Lillabeth had a duty to disclose that the artists had moved to the local village hall, as this is a material fact that would influence Rufus's decision to purchase the café.

- **Misrepresentation by Omission**: In HCA008564/1998, the defendant's failure to disclose the true boundaries of the property constituted a misrepresentation by omission. In our current case, Lillabeth's failure to disclose the artists' relocation similarly constitutes a misrepresentation by omission.

- **Impact on Contractual Decision**: In HCA008564/1998, the misrepresentation materially influenced the plaintiff's decision to enter into the contract. In our current case, the misrepresentation about the artists' presence and the turnover figures materially influenced Rufus's decision to purchase the café.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome: that Rufus is entitled to rescind the contract and recover any deposits made. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA008564/1998, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Transparency and Fairness**: Upholding the principle that all material facts must be disclosed ensures that parties enter into contracts with full knowledge, promoting fairness and transparency in contractual dealings.

2. **Protecting the Misled Party**: Allowing Rufus to rescind the contract protects him from being bound by a contract that he entered into based on misleading information, thereby upholding the integrity of the contractual process.

3. **Deterring Misrepresentation**: This outcome would deter sellers from withholding material information, knowing that such actions could lead to the rescission of the contract and potential legal consequences.

4. **Upholding Good Faith and Fair Dealing**: The decision reinforces the principle of good faith and fair dealing in contract law, ensuring that parties act honestly and do not mislead each other.

Therefore, given the shared fact patterns and the positive effects on the underlying values and principles of the law, the court should reach the same outcome as in HCA008564/1998, allowing Rufus to rescind the contract and recover his deposit.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA008564/1998, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the misrepresentation involved a physical inspection of the property where the yard was visibly part of the premises shown to the plaintiff. This physical inspection was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—such as ensuring transparency and fairness in property transactions—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided clear, observable evidence that the plaintiff was misled by the defendant's conduct.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of a physical inspection leading to a visible misrepresentation is notably absent. Rufus did visit the café, but the misrepresentation here is more about the financial turnover and the status of the artists rather than a physical aspect of the property. The misrepresentation in our case is based on verbal statements and omitted information about the artists' relocation and the actual turnover figures, rather than a misleading physical inspection of the property itself.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in HCA008564/1998: the impact of a newly built bypass around Little Butte, which has caused a substantial fall in the amount of passing trade. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces an external change that affects the business's viability, which was not a consideration in the precedent case.

Due to the presence of the bypass, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as potentially holding Lillabeth accountable for factors beyond her control, unlike in HCA008564/1998. The bypass is an external factor that Rufus could have investigated independently, and it complicates the issue of misrepresentation because it is not directly related to Lillabeth's conduct or omissions. Therefore, the balance of positive and negative effects is significantly altered, making it less clear-cut that Rufus should be entitled to rescind the contract solely based on Lillabeth's misrepresentations.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA008564/1998 should be stated as: "When both [misrepresentation by conduct and omission regarding material facts that influence a contractual decision] and [a physical inspection leading to a visible misrepresentation] are present, the court should decide [that the misled party is entitled to rescind the contract and recover any deposits made]." Omitting [a physical inspection leading to a visible misrepresentation] from this rule could lead to [an undesirable consequence where parties could claim misrepresentation based solely on verbal statements or omitted information without any tangible evidence, thereby increasing frivolous claims and legal uncertainty]. Indeed, the opinion in HCA008564/1998 explicitly states that the physical inspection and the visible misrepresentation were crucial to their decision, as it provided clear, observable evidence that the plaintiff was misled by the defendant's conduct.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA008564/1998 was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties being misled by visible, tangible misrepresentations during property inspections]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [this specific type of visible, tangible misrepresentation occurring]. The misrepresentation in our case is based on verbal statements and omitted information about the artists' relocation and the actual turnover figures, rather than a misleading physical inspection of the property itself. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of a physical inspection leading to a visible misrepresentation, which was present in the precedent case HCA008564/1998, requiring this factor for all similar cases of misrepresentation by conduct and omission regarding material facts that influence a contractual decision would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would limit the scope of protection against misrepresentation to only those cases involving tangible, visible misrepresentations, thereby excluding cases where verbal statements or omitted information play a crucial role in misleading the contracting party. Conversely, not requiring a physical inspection leading to a visible misrepresentation would allow for a broader application of the principles of transparency and fairness in contractual dealings. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which aim to ensure that all material facts are disclosed and that parties enter into contracts with full knowledge, thereby promoting good faith and fair dealing.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of a physical inspection leading to a visible misrepresentation, which was present in HCA008564/1998, we have the additional factor of the substantial fall in passing trade due to the newly built bypass. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of misrepresentation by conduct and omission regarding material facts, serves a similar function to the physical inspection in the precedent case. The bypass significantly impacts the business's viability, which is a material fact that Rufus could not have reasonably discovered on his own. Given the presence of this additional factor, we submit that the reasoning in HCA008564/1998 still applies, as the positive effects on ensuring transparency, fairness, and good faith in contractual dealings would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA008564/1998, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as misrepresentation by conduct and omission regarding material facts that influence a contractual decision. Both cases involve the seller's failure to disclose crucial information that would have significantly impacted the buyer's decision to enter into the contract.

However, the cases also differ in significant ways. In HCA008564/1998, the misrepresentation involved a physical inspection of the property where the yard was visibly part of the premises shown to the plaintiff. This physical inspection provided clear, observable evidence that the plaintiff was misled by the defendant's conduct. In contrast, our current case involves verbal statements and omitted information about the artists' relocation and the actual turnover figures, rather than a misleading physical inspection of the property itself.

The proposed legal rule from HCA008564/1998—that when both misrepresentation by conduct and omission regarding material facts that influence a contractual decision and a physical inspection leading to a visible misrepresentation are present, the court should decide that the misled party is entitled to rescind the contract and recover any deposits made—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that requiring a physical inspection leading to a visible misrepresentation would limit the scope of protection against misrepresentation to only those cases involving tangible, visible misrepresentations, thereby excluding cases where verbal statements or omitted information play a crucial role in misleading the contracting party. Conversely, not requiring a physical inspection leading to a visible misrepresentation would allow for a broader application of the principles of transparency and fairness in contractual dealings.

Considering the underlying legal principles of ensuring transparency, fairness, and good faith in contractual dealings, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Rufus has a potential claim against Lillabeth on the grounds of misrepresentation. The misrepresentation about the artists' presence and the turnover figures materially influenced Rufus's decision to purchase the café. The additional factor of the substantial fall in passing trade due to the newly built bypass further supports the conclusion that Rufus was misled by material omissions and misrepresentations.

Therefore, Rufus is entitled to rescind the contract and recover any deposits made. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by upholding the principles of good faith and fair dealing in contract law.

- The misrepresentation was not made to him fraudulently.
- Rufus would be entitled, by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract.
- It is claimed in any proceedings arising out of the contract that the contract ought to be or has been rescinded.
- The court or arbitrator would likely find it equitable to declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission, considering:
  * The nature of the misrepresentation (material and significant).
  * The loss that would be caused by it if the contract were upheld (substantial financial loss to Rufus).
  * The loss that rescission would cause to Lillabeth (potentially significant but justified).

### Conclusion:

Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1 and 2 apply. Lillabeth is liable to damages for the misrepresentation, and the court would likely declare the contract subsisting and award Rufus damages in lieu of rescission.

### Major Premise:

1. DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited v Sit Pan Jit

   Conditions:
   - A party makes a statement which, at the time when it was made, was false, misleading or deceptive
   - The other party relies on that statement to their detriment

   Consequences:
   - The party making the statement may be liable for misrepresentation

   Exceptions:
   - The reliance on the statement was unreasonable
   - The party making the statement can show legitimate reasons for the statement

### Minor Premise:

1. DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited v Sit Pan Jit:
- Lillabeth made a statement regarding the turnover of the café, which was false at the time it was made.
- Rufus relied on Lillabeth's statement to his detriment by purchasing the café.
- The reliance on the statement was not entirely unreasonable as Lillabeth invited Rufus to verify the account books, but Rufus chose not to due to the condition of the outhouse.
- Lillabeth did not provide any legitimate reasons for the false statement about the turnover.

### Conclusion:

DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited v Sit Pan Jit applies, and Lillabeth may be liable for misrepresentation. Rufus has a potential claim against Lillabeth on the grounds of misrepresentation.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG Plaintiff and MING YIU HENG Defendant)
In the case of HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG Plaintiff and MING YIU HENG Defendant (precedent p), the plaintiff claimed the outstanding balance of the purchase price for shares sold under an equity transfer agreement and sought to void a settlement agreement on the grounds of duress. The defendant counterclaimed for rescission of the equity transfer agreement due to misrepresentation. The court ruled that the defendant was entitled to rescind the equity transfer agreement due to the plaintiff's misrepresentations, despite the defendant having the opportunity to verify the information provided by the plaintiff.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA 1584/2010 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Misrepresentation**: In HCA 1584/2010, the plaintiff made false representations about the value and future investment in the company. In our current case, Lillabeth made false representations about the turnover of the café and the rental income from artists.
- **Reliance on Representations**: In HCA 1584/2010, the defendant relied on the plaintiff's representations when entering into the equity transfer agreement. Similarly, Rufus relied on Lillabeth's representations about the turnover and income sources when deciding to purchase the café.
- **Opportunity to Verify**: In HCA 1584/2010, the defendant had the opportunity to verify the plaintiff's representations but chose not to. In our current case, Rufus had the opportunity to verify the account books but decided to take Lillabeth's word for it.
- **Outcome of Rescission**: In HCA 1584/2010, the court allowed rescission of the contract due to misrepresentation. Rufus seeks a similar remedy in the current case.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA 1584/2010)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of misrepresentation and reliance on those misrepresentations, the court should decide in favor of rescission of the contract. This rule was justified in HCA 1584/2010 because the positive effects (E+) of allowing rescission for misrepresentation uphold the principles of fairness and honesty in contractual dealings, outweighing the negative effects (E-) of potentially allowing parties to avoid contracts based on their own failure to verify information. 

Therefore, applying this rule to our current case, Rufus has a potential claim against Lillabeth on the grounds of misrepresentation, as he relied on her false statements about the turnover and income sources of the café, and this reliance induced him to enter into the contract.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG Plaintiff and MING YIU HENG Defendant) are present:

- **Misrepresentation**: In HCA 1584/2010, the plaintiff made false representations about the value and future investment in the company. In our current case, Lillabeth made false representations about the turnover of the café and the rental income from artists.
- **Reliance on Representations**: In HCA 1584/2010, the defendant relied on the plaintiff's representations when entering into the equity transfer agreement. Similarly, Rufus relied on Lillabeth's representations about the turnover and income sources when deciding to purchase the café.
- **Opportunity to Verify**: In HCA 1584/2010, the defendant had the opportunity to verify the plaintiff's representations but chose not to. In our current case, Rufus had the opportunity to verify the account books but decided to take Lillabeth's word for it.
- **Outcome of Rescission**: In HCA 1584/2010, the court allowed rescission of the contract due to misrepresentation. Rufus seeks a similar remedy in the current case.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome of allowing rescission of the contract due to misrepresentation. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA 1584/2010, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Fairness and Honesty in Contractual Dealings**: Allowing rescission in cases of misrepresentation ensures that parties cannot benefit from deceitful practices. This promotes a fair and honest marketplace, which is essential for the integrity of commercial transactions.

2. **Protecting the Innocent Party**: Rufus, like the defendant in HCA 1584/2010, relied on the false representations made by Lillabeth. Allowing rescission protects Rufus from being bound by a contract that he entered into based on misleading information.

3. **Deterrence of Misrepresentation**: By ruling in favor of rescission, the court sends a strong message that misrepresentation will not be tolerated. This deters parties from making false statements to induce others into contracts, thereby promoting ethical behavior in business dealings.

4. **Consistency in Legal Principles**: Applying the same rule as in HCA 1584/2010 ensures consistency in the application of legal principles. This predictability is crucial for the stability of the legal system and for parties to understand the consequences of their actions.

Therefore, given the shared fact patterns and the positive effects on the underlying values and principles of the law, the court should allow Rufus to rescind the contract with Lillabeth on the grounds of misrepresentation.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG Plaintiff and MING YIU HENG Defendant, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the misrepresentations made by the plaintiff were directly related to the core aspects of the equity transfer agreement, specifically the value and future investment in the company. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as upholding fairness and honesty in contractual dealings and protecting the innocent party, outweighed any potential drawbacks because the misrepresentations were central to the defendant's decision to enter into the contract.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as the misrepresentations made by Lillabeth about the turnover and income sources of the café, while significant, do not directly relate to the core operational aspects of the business that Rufus was primarily interested in. Rufus was more interested in the café business itself rather than the rental income from the artists. Therefore, the misrepresentations, although material, do not have the same centrality to the core purpose of the contract as in the precedent case.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG Plaintiff and MING YIU HENG Defendant. This factor is the substantial change in circumstances due to the construction of the bypass around Little Butte, which significantly reduced the passing trade and, consequently, the turnover of the café. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces an external change that impacts the business's viability, which was not a consideration in the precedent case.

Due to this factor, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as unfairly holding Lillabeth accountable for an external change that she could not control, unlike in HCA 1584/2010 where the misrepresentations were entirely within the plaintiff's control. This external change significantly impacts the balance of positive and negative effects, making it less clear that rescission would be the appropriate remedy in this context.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG Plaintiff and MING YIU HENG Defendant should be stated as: "When both [misrepresentation] and [the misrepresentation directly relates to the core aspects of the contract] are present, the court should decide [to allow rescission of the contract]." Omitting [the misrepresentation directly relates to the core aspects of the contract] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q], which is the potential for parties to rescind contracts based on misrepresentations that are not central to the contract's purpose, thereby creating instability and uncertainty in commercial transactions. Indeed, the opinion in HCA 1584/2010 explicitly states that the misrepresentations were crucial to the defendant's decision to enter into the contract, highlighting the importance of the misrepresentations being central to the contract.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG Plaintiff and MING YIU HENG Defendant was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of parties being bound by contracts entered into based on central and material misrepresentations. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence occurring because the misrepresentations made by Lillabeth, while significant, do not directly relate to the core operational aspects of the café business that Rufus was primarily interested in. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—to protect parties from being bound by contracts based on central misrepresentations—is not relevant to our situation where the misrepresentations are not central to the contract's core purpose.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of the misrepresentation directly relating to the core aspects of the contract, which was present in the precedent case HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG Plaintiff and MING YIU HENG Defendant, requiring this factor for all similar cases of misrepresentation would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would allow parties to make significant misrepresentations about material aspects of a contract without facing the possibility of rescission, simply because those misrepresentations do not pertain to the core purpose of the contract. This would undermine the principle of fairness and honesty in contractual dealings, as it would enable parties to benefit from deceitful practices in non-core areas of the contract. Conversely, not requiring the misrepresentation to relate directly to the core aspects of the contract would allow for a more comprehensive protection of parties from any material misrepresentation, thereby promoting ethical behavior and fairness in business transactions. This better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, which aim to ensure that all parties enter into contracts based on truthful and accurate information.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of the misrepresentation directly relating to the core aspects of the contract, which was present in HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG Plaintiff and MING YIU HENG Defendant, we have the additional factor of a substantial change in circumstances due to the construction of the bypass around Little Butte. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of misrepresentation and reliance on those misrepresentations, serves a similar function to the core misrepresentation factor in the precedent case. The bypass construction significantly impacts the viability and attractiveness of the café business, which is a material consideration for Rufus's decision to purchase the café. Given the presence of this substantial change in circumstances, we submit that the reasoning in HCA 1584/2010 still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as protecting the innocent party and upholding fairness and honesty in contractual dealings, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG Plaintiff and MING YIU HENG Defendant, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of misrepresentation and reliance on those misrepresentations by the innocent party. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the fact that the misrepresentations in the current case do not directly relate to the core aspects of the contract and the substantial change in circumstances due to the construction of the bypass around Little Butte.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case, which allows for rescission of the contract due to misrepresentation, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the distinctions present in the current case. The argument that the misrepresentation must directly relate to the core aspects of the contract to justify rescission is compelling, as it ensures that only central and material misrepresentations lead to such a drastic remedy. This aligns with the principle of fairness and honesty in contractual dealings, as well as the need to protect the innocent party.

On the other hand, the counterargument that any material misrepresentation, regardless of its relation to the core aspects of the contract, should allow for rescission is also persuasive. This broader approach promotes ethical behavior and fairness in business transactions by ensuring that all parties enter into contracts based on truthful and accurate information.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, honesty, and the protection of the innocent party, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Rufus has a potential claim against Lillabeth on the grounds of misrepresentation. The misrepresentations made by Lillabeth about the turnover and income sources of the café, although not directly related to the core aspects of the contract, are still material and significant. Additionally, the substantial change in circumstances due to the construction of the bypass further supports the need for rescission to ensure fairness and justice.

Therefore, Rufus should be allowed to rescind the contract with Lillabeth on the grounds of misrepresentation. This decision is justified by the need to uphold the principles of fairness and honesty in contractual dealings, protect the innocent party, and promote ethical behavior in business transactions.

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1:
- Rufus has entered into a contract with Lillabeth after a misrepresentation.
- The misrepresentation was made to him by Lillabeth.
- Rufus has suffered loss in the form of reduced turnover and the actual turnover being significantly less than represented.
- If Lillabeth had made the misrepresentation fraudulently, Lillabeth would have been liable to damages.
- However, Lillabeth may argue that she had reasonable grounds to believe her claim was true, and she did believe her claim was true up to the time the contract was made.
- Therefore, this section may not apply if Lillabeth can prove her belief was reasonable and genuine.

2. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2:
- Rufus has entered into a contract to purchase the café.
- Lillabeth's claim about the turnover and the presence of artists is a misrepresentation.
- Rufus has entered into the contract after this misrepresentation has been made to him.
- Lillabeth did not make this misrepresentation fraudulently.
- Rufus would be entitled, by reason of misrepresentation, to rescind the contract.
- It is claimed in any proceedings arising out of the contract that the contract ought to be or has been rescinded.
- Balancing the nature of the misrepresentation,
  * it is an innocent misrepresentation but it is material and significantly affects the value and profitability of the café;
  * the loss that would be suffered by Rufus if the contract was upheld is substantial due to the lower turnover and the bypass reducing passing trade;
  * the loss to Lillabeth if rescission were granted would be the return of the café and potential loss of the sale proceeds.
- Therefore, this section applies and the court would likely declare the contract subsisting and award Rufus damages in lieu of rescission.

### Conclusion:

Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2 applies, and the court would declare the contract subsisting and award Rufus damages in lieu of rescission.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (SPY v. KYH)

In the case of SPY v. KYH [2021] HKCFI 861; HCA 579/2017 (precedent p), the plaintiff sought to set aside a Consent Order on the grounds of non-disclosure and misrepresentation by the defendant. The court found that the defendant had misrepresented his financial circumstances and failed to make full and frank disclosure of his assets, which induced the plaintiff to agree to the Consent Order. The court ruled that the Consent Order should be set aside due to the material misrepresentation and non-disclosure by the defendant.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in SPY v. KYH and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Misrepresentation**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In SPY v. KYH, the defendant misrepresented his financial circumstances, leading the plaintiff to agree to the Consent Order. In the current case, Lillabeth misrepresented the turnover of the café and the status of the artists renting workspaces, leading Rufus to agree to purchase the café.

- **Legal Concept 2: Non-Disclosure**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In SPY v. KYH, the defendant failed to disclose his true financial assets. In the current case, Lillabeth failed to disclose the substantial fall in passing trade due to the newly built bypass and the fact that the artists had moved to the local village hall.

- **Legal Concept 3: Materiality**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In SPY v. KYH, the court found that the non-disclosure and misrepresentation were material as they significantly affected the plaintiff's decision. In the current case, the misrepresentation of the café's turnover and the non-disclosure of the bypass and artists' relocation are material as they significantly affect the value and attractiveness of the business to Rufus.

- **Legal Concept 4: Inducement**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In SPY v. KYH, the plaintiff was induced to agree to the Consent Order based on the defendant's misrepresentation. In the current case, Rufus was induced to purchase the café based on Lillabeth's misrepresentation and non-disclosure.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (SPY v. KYH)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of misrepresentation and non-disclosure (i*), the court should decide to set aside the agreement or contract (outcome o). This rule was justified in SPY v. KYH because the positive effects (E+) of setting aside the Consent Order on the underlying values and principles of the law, such as fairness and justice, outweighed the negative effects (E-) in that case. The court emphasized the importance of full and frank disclosure and the detrimental impact of material misrepresentation on the fairness of agreements.

Applying this rule to the current case, Rufus has a potential claim against Lillabeth on the grounds of misrepresentation and non-disclosure. The misrepresentation of the café's turnover and the non-disclosure of the bypass and artists' relocation are material and induced Rufus to purchase the café. Therefore, Rufus may seek to set aside the contract or claim damages for the misrepresentation and non-disclosure by Lillabeth.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (SPY v. KYH) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Misrepresentation**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In SPY v. KYH, the defendant misrepresented his financial circumstances, leading the plaintiff to agree to the Consent Order. In the current case, Lillabeth misrepresented the turnover of the café and the status of the artists renting workspaces, leading Rufus to agree to purchase the café.

- **Legal Concept 2: Non-Disclosure**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In SPY v. KYH, the defendant failed to disclose his true financial assets. In the current case, Lillabeth failed to disclose the substantial fall in passing trade due to the newly built bypass and the fact that the artists had moved to the local village hall.

- **Legal Concept 3: Materiality**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In SPY v. KYH, the court found that the non-disclosure and misrepresentation were material as they significantly affected the plaintiff's decision. In the current case, the misrepresentation of the café's turnover and the non-disclosure of the bypass and artists' relocation are material as they significantly affect the value and attractiveness of the business to Rufus.

- **Legal Concept 4: Inducement**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In SPY v. KYH, the plaintiff was induced to agree to the Consent Order based on the defendant's misrepresentation. In the current case, Rufus was induced to purchase the café based on Lillabeth's misrepresentation and non-disclosure.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome: setting aside the contract or awarding damages for the misrepresentation and non-disclosure by Lillabeth. This decision would be justified because, as in SPY v. KYH, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Fairness and Justice**: Ensuring that parties to a contract are not misled by false representations or material non-disclosures is fundamental to the integrity of contractual agreements. By setting aside the contract or awarding damages, the court would reinforce the principle that fairness and honesty are paramount in contractual dealings.

2. **Deterrence of Misconduct**: A ruling in favor of Rufus would serve as a deterrent to others who might consider engaging in similar deceptive practices. It sends a clear message that misrepresentation and non-disclosure will not be tolerated and will have legal consequences.

3. **Protection of Reliance Interests**: Rufus relied on the information provided by Lillabeth when deciding to purchase the café. By addressing the misrepresentation and non-disclosure, the court would protect Rufus's reliance interests and ensure that he is not unfairly disadvantaged by Lillabeth's actions.

4. **Encouraging Full and Frank Disclosure**: The decision would emphasize the importance of full and frank disclosure in contractual negotiations, encouraging parties to be transparent and honest about material facts that could influence the other party's decision.

In conclusion, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns as SPY v. KYH, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in SPY v. KYH, it would uphold fairness and justice, deter misconduct, protect reliance interests, and encourage full and frank disclosure.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case SPY v. KYH, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the misrepresentation and non-disclosure were related to the defendant's financial circumstances, which were directly relevant to the Consent Order regarding financial and ancillary relief. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—upholding fairness and justice, deterring misconduct, protecting reliance interests, and encouraging full and frank disclosure—outweighed any potential drawbacks because the financial misrepresentation directly impacted the terms of the Consent Order and the plaintiff's financial obligations.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of financial misrepresentation directly impacting a legal order is notably absent. While Lillabeth's misrepresentation and non-disclosure pertain to the turnover and operational aspects of the café business, they do not involve a legal order or court proceedings. Instead, they relate to a commercial transaction between private parties. This distinction means that the context and implications of the misrepresentation are different, as they do not directly affect a court's decision or legal obligations but rather the commercial viability and attractiveness of a business.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—the substantial fall in passing trade due to the newly built bypass—that was not present in SPY v. KYH. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of misrepresentation and non-disclosure because it introduces an external change in circumstances that affects the business's viability, which was not a consideration in the precedent case.

Due to the bypass, applying the same outcome of setting aside the contract or awarding damages in our case would have more negative consequences, such as potentially undermining the principle that parties should conduct due diligence in commercial transactions, than positive ones. Unlike in SPY v. KYH, where the misrepresentation directly impacted the fairness of a legal order, the bypass in our case introduces a change in external circumstances that Rufus could have discovered through due diligence. Therefore, the presence of this factor suggests that the misrepresentation and non-disclosure by Lillabeth, while material, may not solely justify setting aside the contract without considering Rufus's responsibility to investigate external factors affecting the business.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from SPY v. KYH should be stated as "When both [misrepresentation and non-disclosure] and [the misrepresentation directly impacting a legal order or court proceedings] are present, the court should decide [to set aside the agreement or contract]." Omitting [the misrepresentation directly impacting a legal order or court proceedings] from this rule could lead to [an undesirable consequence where commercial transactions are unduly disrupted by claims of misrepresentation that could have been discovered through due diligence]. Indeed, the opinion in SPY v. KYH explicitly states that the misrepresentation and non-disclosure were crucial to their decision because they directly affected the fairness of a legal order regarding financial and ancillary relief.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in SPY v. KYH was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of unfair legal orders being made based on false financial representations]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [unfair legal orders being made] because the context involves a commercial transaction between private parties, not a legal order or court proceedings. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the focus should be on whether Rufus conducted due diligence and the impact of external changes like the bypass, which are not factors in the precedent case.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of "the misrepresentation directly impacting a legal order or court proceedings," which was present in the precedent case SPY v. KYH, requiring this factor for all similar cases of misrepresentation and non-disclosure would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would unduly limit the application of legal remedies for misrepresentation and non-disclosure to only those cases involving legal orders, thereby excluding commercial transactions where such misrepresentations can also have significant detrimental effects. Conversely, not requiring this factor would allow for a more comprehensive application of legal principles that protect parties from being misled in various contexts, including commercial transactions. This better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, which aim to uphold fairness, honesty, and transparency in all contractual dealings, not just those involving legal orders.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of "the misrepresentation directly impacting a legal order or court proceedings," which was present in SPY v. KYH, we have the additional factor of "the substantial fall in passing trade due to the newly built bypass." This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of misrepresentation and non-disclosure, serves a similar function to the financial misrepresentation in the precedent case. Given the presence of this factor, we submit that the reasoning in SPY v. KYH still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values—such as upholding fairness and justice, deterring misconduct, protecting reliance interests, and encouraging full and frank disclosure—would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. The bypass significantly impacts the commercial viability of the café, making the non-disclosure of this fact material and justifying a similar legal remedy.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to SPY v. KYH, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of misrepresentation and non-disclosure, which materially affected the decision-making process of the aggrieved party. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the context of a commercial transaction versus a legal order and the impact of an external change (the bypass) on the business's viability.

The proposed legal rule of setting aside the agreement or awarding damages in cases of material misrepresentation and non-disclosure finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of upholding fairness and justice, deterring misconduct, and protecting reliance interests, against the need for parties to conduct due diligence in commercial transactions.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, honesty, and transparency in contractual dealings, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Rufus has a valid claim against Lillabeth on the grounds of misrepresentation and non-disclosure. The misrepresentation of the café's turnover and the non-disclosure of the bypass and artists' relocation are material and induced Rufus to purchase the café. Therefore, Rufus may seek to set aside the contract or claim damages for the misrepresentation and non-disclosure by Lillabeth.

This decision is justified because it upholds the principles of fairness and justice, deters similar misconduct in future commercial transactions, and protects the reliance interests of parties who are misled by false representations. While the context of a commercial transaction requires some level of due diligence, the materiality and impact of the misrepresentation and non-disclosure in this case are significant enough to warrant legal remedy.

   - Is liable on conviction upon indictment to a fine at tier 9 and to imprisonment for 7 years

   Exceptions:
   - None

4. Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance Cap. 615 Section 53ZRG Subsection 3

   Conditions:
   - A person makes a fraudulent misrepresentation
   - The misrepresentation is made to induce another person to invest in virtual assets

   Consequences:
   - The person commits an offence

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Residential Properties (First-hand Sales) Ordinance Cap. 621 Section 76 Subsection 1:
   - Lillabeth made a fraudulent misrepresentation about the turnover of the café.
   - The misrepresentation was made to induce Rufus to purchase the café.
   - However, the café is not a specified residential property.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

2. Securities and Futures Ordinance Cap. 571 Section 107 Subsection 3:
   - Lillabeth made a fraudulent misrepresentation about the turnover of the café.
   - The misrepresentation was made to induce Rufus to purchase the café, not to invest money.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

3. Banking Ordinance Cap. 155 Section 93 Subsection 1:
   - Lillabeth made a fraudulent misrepresentation about the turnover of the café.
   - The misrepresentation was made to induce Rufus to purchase the café, not to make a deposit.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

4. Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance Cap. 615 Section 53ZRG Subsection 3:
   - Lillabeth made a fraudulent misrepresentation about the turnover of the café.
   - The misrepresentation was made to induce Rufus to purchase the café, not to invest in virtual assets.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

### Conclusion:

None of the specified ordinances apply to the scenario as they pertain to specific types of fraudulent misrepresentation (residential property, investment, deposits, and virtual assets) which do not cover the sale of a café. However, under general principles of contract law, Rufus may have a claim for fraudulent misrepresentation against Lillabeth, which could entitle him to rescind the contract and/or claim damages.

### Relevant law:

FACV000025A/1998 and Green Park Properties Limited v Dorku Limited

### Major Premise:

1. FACV000025A/1998

   Conditions:
   - A statement is made that is literally true but gives a misleading impression; or
   - A statement is made that implies a state of affairs that other facts would show to be false; or
   - Facts which falsify the representation come into existence later, but before the representation has been relied upon

   Consequences:
   - The representor is under a duty to correct what he said and not allow the other party to rely upon a statement which has become false

   Exceptions:
   - There is no duty of disclosure, such as exists in contracts of insurance

2. Green Park Properties Limited v Dorku Limited

   Conditions:
   - A representation is made by one party to another regarding the subject-matter of a sale; and
   - The representation is found to be misleading; and
   - The misleading representation induces the other party to enter into the agreement

   Consequences:
   - The misled party is entitled to rescind the agreement and
   - May be entitled to the return of any deposit and
   - May be awarded damages for wasted expenses

   Exceptions:
   - The misled party had the opportunity to verify the representation and chose not to; or
   - The misled party did not rely on the representation

### Minor Premise:

1. FACV000025A/1998:
- Lillabeth made a statement that the turnover of the café was £100,000 p.a., which is literally true but gives a misleading impression because the actual turnover never exceeded £50,000.
- Lillabeth did not disclose that the artists had moved to the local village hall, which implies a state of affairs that other facts would show to be false.
- The planned bypass, which caused a substantial fall in passing trade, came into existence before Rufus relied upon the representation.
- Therefore, Lillabeth was under a duty to correct her statements and not allow Rufus to rely upon a statement which had become false.

2. Green Park Properties Limited v Dorku Limited:
- Lillabeth made a representation to Rufus regarding the turnover of the café.
- The representation was misleading as the actual turnover never exceeded £50,000.
- The misleading representation induced Rufus to enter into the agreement.
- Rufus had the opportunity to verify the representation by checking the account books but chose not to.
- However, Rufus relied on Lillabeth's representation.

### Conclusion:

Rufus has a potential claim against Lillabeth on the grounds of misrepresentation. Lillabeth's statements were misleading and induced Rufus to enter into the agreement. Although Rufus had the opportunity to verify the representation, he relied on Lillabeth's misleading statements. Therefore, Rufus is entitled to rescind the agreement, may be entitled to the return of any deposit, and may be awarded damages for wasted expenses.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER)

In the case of LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER [2021] HKCFI 1501; HCA 2593/2017 (precedent p), the plaintiffs alleged fraudulent misrepresentation by the defendants. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants had made false representations about the financial status and operations of certain companies, which induced the plaintiffs to enter into an investment agreement. The court ruled that for a claim of fraudulent misrepresentation to succeed, the following elements must be established: (1) a representation of fact made by words or conduct, (2) the representation must be made with knowledge that it is, or may be, false, (3) the representation must be made with the intention that it should be acted upon by the claimant, (4) the claimant must have acted upon the false statement, and (5) the claimant must have suffered damage by so doing. The court found that the plaintiffs had not sufficiently proven these elements and thus ruled in favor of the defendants.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Representation of Fact**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (Precedent):** The defendants allegedly made false representations about the financial status and operations of SSHK and SSZQ.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (Current Case):** Lillabeth represented that the café's turnover was £100,000, with specific amounts attributed to café sales, art sales, and rentals.

- **Legal Concept 2: Knowledge of Falsity**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (Precedent):** The plaintiffs needed to prove that the defendants knew the representations were false or made them recklessly.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (Current Case):** Rufus needs to prove that Lillabeth knew the turnover figures were false or made them recklessly.

- **Legal Concept 3: Intention to Induce Action**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (Precedent):** The representations were made with the intention that the plaintiffs would act upon them by entering into the investment agreement.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (Current Case):** Lillabeth's representations were made with the intention that Rufus would act upon them by purchasing the café.

- **Legal Concept 4: Reliance and Damage**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (Precedent):** The plaintiffs acted upon the false representations and claimed to have suffered damage as a result.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (Current Case):** Rufus acted upon Lillabeth's representations by purchasing the café and suffered damage when he discovered the true turnover and the impact of the bypass.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a false representation of fact made with knowledge of its falsity, with the intention to induce the claimant to act upon it, and resulting in the claimant acting upon it and suffering damage, the court should decide in favor of the claimant for fraudulent misrepresentation. This rule was justified in LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER because the positive effects (E+) of outcome o on the underlying values and principles of the law, such as promoting honesty and integrity in business transactions and protecting parties from fraudulent conduct, outweigh the negative effects (E-) in that case. 

Therefore, applying this rule to the current case, Rufus has a potential claim against Lillabeth for fraudulent misrepresentation, as the fact patterns align with those in the precedent case.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Representation of Fact**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (Precedent):** The defendants allegedly made false representations about the financial status and operations of SSHK and SSZQ.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (Current Case):** Lillabeth represented that the café's turnover was £100,000, with specific amounts attributed to café sales, art sales, and rentals.

- **Legal Concept 2: Knowledge of Falsity**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (Precedent):** The plaintiffs needed to prove that the defendants knew the representations were false or made them recklessly.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (Current Case):** Rufus needs to prove that Lillabeth knew the turnover figures were false or made them recklessly. Given that the actual turnover never exceeded £50,000, it is likely that Lillabeth knew or was reckless about the truth of her statements.

- **Legal Concept 3: Intention to Induce Action**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (Precedent):** The representations were made with the intention that the plaintiffs would act upon them by entering into the investment agreement.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (Current Case):** Lillabeth's representations were made with the intention that Rufus would act upon them by purchasing the café.

- **Legal Concept 4: Reliance and Damage**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (Precedent):** The plaintiffs acted upon the false representations and claimed to have suffered damage as a result.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (Current Case):** Rufus acted upon Lillabeth's representations by purchasing the café and suffered damage when he discovered the true turnover and the impact of the bypass.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Promoting Honesty and Integrity in Business Transactions:** By ruling in favor of Rufus, the court would reinforce the importance of honesty and integrity in business dealings, deterring parties from making false representations to induce transactions.

2. **Protecting Parties from Fraudulent Conduct:** The decision would protect individuals and businesses from being misled by fraudulent statements, ensuring that they can rely on the representations made to them when entering into contracts.

3. **Encouraging Due Diligence:** While Rufus did not inspect the account books due to their condition, the ruling would emphasize the importance of due diligence and the responsibility of sellers to provide accurate and truthful information.

4. **Maintaining Market Confidence:** Upholding the principles of fair dealing and transparency would help maintain confidence in the market, encouraging investment and economic activity.

Therefore, the court should find that Lillabeth's misrepresentation constitutes fraudulent misrepresentation, entitling Rufus to rescind the contract and seek damages for the losses incurred.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of **contemporaneous written records** and **documentary evidence**. These records were key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—promoting honesty and integrity in business transactions and protecting parties from fraudulent conduct—outweighed any potential drawbacks because they provided a clear, objective basis for assessing the credibility of the representations made.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of **contemporaneous written records** is notably absent. Rufus did not inspect the account books due to their condition, and there is no mention of any other documentary evidence that could objectively verify Lillabeth's representations about the café's turnover. This absence makes it more challenging to establish the elements of fraudulent misrepresentation with the same level of certainty as in the precedent case.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor **(the impact of the newly built bypass)** that was not present in **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the bypass has caused a substantial fall in the amount of passing trade, directly affecting the café's business potential and Rufus's reliance on the turnover figures provided by Lillabeth.

Due to the presence of the bypass, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as **undermining the reliance on accurate and current representations in business transactions**, than positive ones, unlike in **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER**. The bypass introduces a new dimension of reliance and damage that was not considered in the precedent case, making the misrepresentation more impactful and the need for accurate information more critical.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER** should be stated as: "When both [a representation of fact made with knowledge of its falsity, with the intention to induce the claimant to act upon it, and resulting in the claimant acting upon it and suffering damage] and [the absence of contemporaneous written records or documentary evidence] are present, the court should decide [in favor of the claimant for fraudulent misrepresentation]." Omitting [the absence of contemporaneous written records or documentary evidence] from this rule could lead to [an undesirable consequence of undermining the reliance on accurate and current representations in business transactions]. Indeed, the opinion in **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER** explicitly states that [the presence of contemporaneous written records and documentary evidence was crucial to their decision].

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties being misled by fraudulent statements without sufficient evidence to prove the misrepresentation]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [this specific undesirable consequence occurring] because the absence of contemporaneous written records or documentary evidence makes it more challenging to establish the elements of fraudulent misrepresentation with the same level of certainty. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the contemporaneous written records or documentary evidence, which was present in the precedent case **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of fraudulent misrepresentation would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would mean that claimants who have been misled by fraudulent statements but lack contemporaneous written records would be unable to seek redress, thereby allowing fraudulent parties to escape liability simply because their misrepresentations were not documented. Conversely, not requiring contemporaneous written records would allow for a more equitable outcome, ensuring that parties who have been genuinely misled and suffered damage can still seek justice. This better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, which aim to promote honesty and integrity in business transactions and protect parties from fraudulent conduct.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the contemporaneous written records or documentary evidence, which was present in **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER**, we have the additional factor of the newly built bypass. This bypass, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of fraudulent misrepresentation, serves a similar function to the contemporaneous written records in the precedent case. The bypass directly impacts the business's turnover and Rufus's reliance on the turnover figures provided by Lillabeth, making the misrepresentation more impactful and the need for accurate information more critical. Given the presence of the bypass, we submit that the reasoning in **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER** still applies, as the positive effects on promoting honesty and integrity in business transactions and protecting parties from fraudulent conduct would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations:

**Key Similarities:**
1. **Representation of Fact:** Both cases involve representations about the financial status of a business.
2. **Knowledge of Falsity:** In both cases, the claimants allege that the representations were made with knowledge of their falsity or recklessly.
3. **Intention to Induce Action:** The representations were made with the intention that the claimants would act upon them.
4. **Reliance and Damage:** The claimants acted upon the representations and suffered damage as a result.

**Key Differences:**
1. **Contemporaneous Written Records:** The precedent case had contemporaneous written records and documentary evidence, which were crucial in assessing the credibility of the representations. In the current case, such records are absent.
2. **Impact of External Factors:** The current case involves the additional factor of a newly built bypass, which significantly affects the business's turnover and Rufus's reliance on the turnover figures provided by Lillabeth.

**Proposed Legal Rule:**
The rule from **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER** suggests that when a false representation of fact is made with knowledge of its falsity, with the intention to induce the claimant to act upon it, and resulting in the claimant acting upon it and suffering damage, the court should decide in favor of the claimant for fraudulent misrepresentation.

**Weighing Arguments:**
- **For the Claimant (Rufus):** The absence of contemporaneous written records should not preclude a finding of fraudulent misrepresentation, especially given the significant impact of the bypass and the clear discrepancy in the turnover figures.
- **For the Defendant (Lillabeth):** The lack of documentary evidence makes it more challenging to establish the elements of fraudulent misrepresentation with the same level of certainty as in the precedent case.

**Legal Principles:**
- **Promoting Honesty and Integrity in Business Transactions:** Upholding the principles of fair dealing and transparency is crucial.
- **Protecting Parties from Fraudulent Conduct:** Ensuring that parties can rely on representations made to them when entering into contracts is essential.

**Final Decision:**
Considering the underlying legal principles and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Rufus has a valid claim against Lillabeth for fraudulent misrepresentation. The absence of contemporaneous written records is mitigated by the significant impact of the bypass and the clear discrepancy in the turnover figures. Upholding Rufus's claim aligns with the principles of promoting honesty and integrity in business transactions and protecting parties from fraudulent conduct.

Therefore, the court should find that Lillabeth's misrepresentation constitutes fraudulent misrepresentation, entitling Rufus to rescind the contract and seek damages for the losses incurred. This decision is justified as it serves justice and legal consistency, ensuring that parties who have been genuinely misled and suffered damage can still seek redress.

   Consequences:
   - The court or arbitrator may declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 2:
- Rufus has entered into a contract with Lillabeth after a misrepresentation has been made to him.
- The misrepresentation regarding the turnover and the artists' rental income has become a term of the contract.
- The contract has been performed.
- Rufus would be entitled to rescind the contract without alleging fraud.
- Therefore, Rufus shall be entitled to rescind the contract, subject to the provisions of the Ordinance.

2. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1:
- Rufus has entered into a contract with Lillabeth after a misrepresentation.
- The misrepresentation was made to him by Lillabeth.
- Rufus has suffered loss as a result of the misrepresentation, as the turnover was significantly less than represented.
- If the misrepresentation had been made fraudulently, Lillabeth would be liable to damages.
- Lillabeth may argue that she had reasonable grounds to believe that the facts represented were true and that she did believe up to the time the contract was made that the facts represented were true.
- Therefore, this section may not apply if Lillabeth can prove her belief and reasonable grounds.

3. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2:
- Rufus has entered into a contract to purchase the café.
- The misrepresentation regarding the turnover and the artists' rental income was made to him.
- The misrepresentation was not made to him fraudulently.
- Rufus would be entitled, by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract.
- Rufus claims in proceedings arising out of the contract that the contract ought to be rescinded.
- The court or arbitrator would consider it equitable to do so, having regard to:
  * The nature of the misrepresentation (significant overstatement of turnover)
  * The loss that would be caused by it if the contract were upheld (Rufus would suffer financial loss)
  * The loss that rescission would cause to Lillabeth (potentially losing the sale)
- Therefore, the court or arbitrator may declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission.

### Conclusion:

Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 2 and Section 3 Subsection 2 apply. Rufus is entitled to rescind the contract based on the misrepresentation. Alternatively, the court may declare the contract subsisting and award Rufus damages in lieu of rescission.

   - The representation was misleading as the actual turnover was never more than £50,000, contrary to the £100,000 claimed.
   - Rufus relied on this representation to enter into the agreement, as evidenced by his decision not to inspect the account books and proceed with the purchase.
   - The misleading representation was material to Rufus's decision to enter into the agreement, as the turnover figures were a significant factor in his decision to buy the café.

   Therefore, the conditions for rescission are satisfied.

   - There is no indication that there is a term excluding liability for misrepresentation that satisfies the requirement of reasonableness as stated in section 3(1) of the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, Cap. 71.

### Conclusion:

Rufus is entitled to rescind the agreement based on misrepresentation by Lillabeth.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS [2019] HKCFI 65)

In the case of CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS [2019] HKCFI 65 (precedent p), the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants had fraudulently misrepresented the value of the business and stock in a share sale agreement. The court ruled that the plaintiffs failed to prove the alleged fraudulent misrepresentation and breach of contract. The court emphasized that the plaintiffs had undertaken due diligence and were legally represented at the time of signing the agreement. The court dismissed the plaintiffs' claims and ordered them to bear the costs on an indemnity basis.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Misrepresentation**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the plaintiffs allege that the defendants made false statements about the value of the business or its components. In precedent p, Chan claimed that the value of the stock was misrepresented. In the current case, Rufus claims that the turnover of the café was misrepresented.

- **Legal Concept 2: Due Diligence**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In both cases, the plaintiffs had the opportunity to verify the information provided by the defendants but chose not to. In precedent p, Chan had access to financial statements and was legally represented. In the current case, Rufus was invited to see the account books but decided to take Lillabeth's word for it.

- **Legal Concept 3: Entire Agreement Clause**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In precedent p, the Share Sale Agreement contained an entire agreement clause, which stated that all prior representations were superseded by the agreement. While the current case does not explicitly mention such a clause, the principle that the written contract supersedes prior representations is relevant.

- **Legal Concept 4: Burden of Proof**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In both cases, the burden of proof lies with the plaintiffs to prove that the misrepresentation occurred. In precedent p, the plaintiffs failed to provide credible evidence. In the current case, Rufus would need to provide evidence that Lillabeth's statements were false and that he relied on them to his detriment.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of alleged misrepresentation, opportunity for due diligence, and the burden of proof on the plaintiff, the court should decide against the plaintiff if they fail to provide credible evidence of the misrepresentation. This rule was justified in CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS because the plaintiffs had the opportunity to verify the information, were legally represented, and failed to provide credible evidence of the alleged misrepresentation. The positive effects (E+) of this outcome include upholding the integrity of contractual agreements and encouraging parties to perform due diligence. The negative effects (E-) are minimal as the plaintiffs had the opportunity to verify the information but chose not to.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Misrepresentation**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the plaintiffs allege that the defendants made false statements about the value of the business or its components. In precedent p, Chan claimed that the value of the stock was misrepresented. In the current case, Rufus claims that the turnover of the café was misrepresented.

- **Legal Concept 2: Due Diligence**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In both cases, the plaintiffs had the opportunity to verify the information provided by the defendants but chose not to. In precedent p, Chan had access to financial statements and was legally represented. In the current case, Rufus was invited to see the account books but decided to take Lillabeth's word for it.

- **Legal Concept 3: Entire Agreement Clause**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In precedent p, the Share Sale Agreement contained an entire agreement clause, which stated that all prior representations were superseded by the agreement. While the current case does not explicitly mention such a clause, the principle that the written contract supersedes prior representations is relevant.

- **Legal Concept 4: Burden of Proof**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In both cases, the burden of proof lies with the plaintiffs to prove that the misrepresentation occurred. In precedent p, the plaintiffs failed to provide credible evidence. In the current case, Rufus would need to provide evidence that Lillabeth's statements were false and that he relied on them to his detriment.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding the Integrity of Contractual Agreements**: Enforcing the principle that parties must perform due diligence before entering into contracts ensures that agreements are respected and upheld. This promotes stability and predictability in commercial transactions.

2. **Encouraging Due Diligence**: By placing the burden of proof on the plaintiff and emphasizing the importance of due diligence, the court encourages parties to thoroughly investigate and verify information before committing to a contract. This reduces the likelihood of disputes and litigation.

3. **Deterring Frivolous Claims**: Dismissing claims that lack credible evidence of misrepresentation discourages parties from making unfounded allegations. This helps to maintain the efficiency of the legal system by reducing the number of baseless claims.

4. **Fairness to Defendants**: Ensuring that defendants are not held liable for alleged misrepresentations without credible evidence protects their rights and interests. This is particularly important when the plaintiff had the opportunity to verify the information but chose not to.

In conclusion, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns as the precedent case, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because it would uphold the integrity of contractual agreements, encourage due diligence, deter frivolous claims, and ensure fairness to defendants.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS [2019] HKCFI 65**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of an **entire agreement clause** in the Share Sale Agreement. This clause was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as upholding the integrity of contractual agreements and encouraging due diligence, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it explicitly stated that all prior representations were superseded by the written agreement. However, in our current case, this crucial **entire agreement clause** is notably absent as there is no mention of such a clause in the contract between Rufus and Lillabeth. This absence means that prior representations made by Lillabeth could still be considered relevant and actionable, unlike in the precedent case where they were explicitly excluded.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor **(the bypass construction)** that was not present in **CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS [2019] HKCFI 65**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the construction of the bypass has caused a substantial fall in the amount of passing trade, which directly impacts the turnover and profitability of the café. Due to this bypass construction, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as unfairly holding Rufus to a contract based on misrepresented turnover figures that were significantly affected by an external factor, unlike in **CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS [2019] HKCFI 65** where no such external factor was present. This makes the misrepresentation more material and detrimental to Rufus, thereby justifying a different outcome.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS [2019] HKCFI 65** should be stated as: "When both [the fact pattern of alleged misrepresentation, opportunity for due diligence, and the burden of proof on the plaintiff] and [the absence of an entire agreement clause or the presence of a significant external factor affecting the business] are present, the court should decide [in favor of the plaintiff if they can prove the misrepresentation and its material impact]." Omitting [the absence of an entire agreement clause or the presence of a significant external factor affecting the business] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of unfairly holding plaintiffs to contracts based on misrepresented figures that were significantly affected by external factors, thereby causing unjust enrichment of the defendants]. Indeed, the opinion in **CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS [2019] HKCFI 65** explicitly states that [the entire agreement clause was crucial to their decision, as it superseded all prior representations and communications].

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS [2019] HKCFI 65** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties retracting from a contract based on prior representations that were explicitly superseded by an entire agreement clause]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [this consequence occurring] because there is no mention of an entire agreement clause in the contract between Rufus and Lillabeth. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should consider the material impact of the misrepresentation and the significant external factor (the bypass construction) on the business, which were not present in the precedent case.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the **entire agreement clause**, which was present in the precedent case **CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS [2019] HKCFI 65**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of **alleged misrepresentation** would lead to the undesirable consequence of allowing defendants to escape liability for misrepresentations simply because an entire agreement clause was not included in the contract. Conversely, not requiring the entire agreement clause would allow for a more equitable outcome, ensuring that parties who have been misled by material misrepresentations can seek redress. This better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, which aim to protect parties from fraudulent or negligent misrepresentations and ensure fairness in contractual dealings.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the **entire agreement clause**, which was present in **CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS [2019] HKCFI 65**, we have the additional **factor of the bypass construction**. This **bypass construction**, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of **alleged misrepresentation and opportunity for due diligence**, serves a similar function to the entire agreement clause in the precedent case by significantly impacting the business's turnover and making the misrepresentation more material. Given the presence of the bypass construction, we submit that the reasoning in **CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS [2019] HKCFI 65** still applies, as the positive effects on **ensuring fairness and protecting parties from material misrepresentations** would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **CHAN YI PANG AND OTHERS v. SIN YUK LING AND OTHERS [2019] HKCFI 65**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the allegations of misrepresentation, the opportunity for due diligence, and the burden of proof on the plaintiff. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of an entire agreement clause and the presence of a substantial external factor (the bypass construction) that materially affects the business.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case—that the court should decide against the plaintiff if they fail to provide credible evidence of the misrepresentation—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the unique factors present in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the absence of an entire agreement clause and the bypass construction significantly alter the context and impact of the alleged misrepresentation. On the other hand, the argument that due diligence was not performed by Rufus, similar to the precedent case, also holds weight.

Considering the underlying legal principles of ensuring fairness, protecting parties from material misrepresentations, and encouraging due diligence, we conclude that Rufus has a potential claim against Lillabeth on the grounds of misrepresentation. The absence of an entire agreement clause and the significant impact of the bypass construction justify a different outcome from the precedent case. Rufus should be allowed to seek rescission of the contract based on the material misrepresentation of the café's turnover and the substantial external factor affecting the business.

Therefore, the decision reached is that Rufus has a valid claim for rescission of the contract due to misrepresentation, taking into account the unique factors of the current case that distinguish it from the precedent. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency.

   Exceptions:
   - The person making the misrepresentation proves that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the facts represented were true
   - The person making the misrepresentation did believe up to the time the contract was made that the facts represented were true

2. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - A person has entered into a contract
   - He entered into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to him
   - The misrepresentation was not made to him fraudulently
   - He would be entitled, by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract
   - It is claimed in any proceedings arising out of the contract that the contract ought to be or has been rescinded
   - The court or arbitrator is of opinion that it would be equitable to do so, having regard to:
     * The nature of the misrepresentation
     * The loss that would be caused by it if the contract were upheld
     * The loss that rescission would cause to the other party

   Consequences:
   - The court or arbitrator may declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1:
- Rufus has entered into a contract with Lillabeth after a misrepresentation.
- The misrepresentation was made to him by Lillabeth.
- Rufus has suffered loss as a result of the misrepresentation, as the turnover was significantly less than represented.
- If Lillabeth had made the misrepresentation fraudulently, she would have been liable to damages.
- Lillabeth did not have reasonable grounds to believe that the facts represented were true, as the actual turnover was never more than £50,000.
- Therefore, this section applies, and Lillabeth is liable to damages.

2. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2:
- Rufus has entered into a contract to purchase the café.
- Lillabeth's claim about the turnover is a misrepresentation.
- Rufus entered into the contract after this misrepresentation was made to him.
- Lillabeth did not make this misrepresentation fraudulently.
- Rufus would be entitled, by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract.
- Rufus may claim in proceedings that the contract ought to be rescinded.
- The court or arbitrator would consider it equitable to award damages in lieu of rescission, given the nature of the misrepresentation and the losses involved.

### Conclusion:

Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1 and 2 apply. Lillabeth is liable to damages for the misrepresentation, and the court may declare the contract subsisting and award Rufus damages in lieu of rescission.

   Conditions:
   - A statement is made that is literally true but gives a misleading impression; or
   - A statement is made that implies a state of affairs that other facts would show to be false; or

   Exceptions:
   - There is no duty of disclosure, such as exists in contracts of insurance

### Minor Premise:

1. Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v Robert John Francis Brothers:
- Lillabeth made a statement in the advertisement that the turnover of the café is £100,000 p.a., which is literally true but gives a misleading impression because the actual turnover has never been more than £50,000.
- Lillabeth made a statement to Rufus that £65,000 of the income is derived from the café sales, £30,000 from art sales, and £5,000 from rentals, which implies a state of affairs that other facts (the actual turnover) would show to be false.
- The planned bypass, which caused a substantial fall in the amount of passing trade, came into existence before Rufus relied upon the representation by signing the contract.
- Therefore, Lillabeth was under a duty to correct what she said and not allow Rufus to rely upon a statement which had become false.

### Conclusion:

Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v Robert John Francis Brothers applies, and Lillabeth was under a duty to correct her statements and not allow Rufus to rely upon them. Rufus has a potential claim against Lillabeth on the grounds of misrepresentation.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA 1830/2013 BETWEEN MIDLAND REALTY (COMM. & IND.) LIMITED Plaintiff and NCF (HK) LIMITED Defendant)
In the case of HCA 1830/2013 BETWEEN MIDLAND REALTY (COMM. & IND.) LIMITED Plaintiff and NCF (HK) LIMITED Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the Defendant was entitled to rescind the agency agreement due to misrepresentation by the Plaintiff's employee, Mr. Chua. The court found that Mr. Chua made false representations regarding the rescindability of a provisional sale and purchase agreement, which induced the Defendant to enter into a second agreement. The Plaintiff was held vicariously liable for Mr. Chua's actions, and the Defendant was awarded damages for the losses incurred.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA 1830/2013 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Actionable Misrepresentation**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA 1830/2013, Mr. Chua made false representations about the rescindability of the First Agreement. In our current case, Lillabeth made false representations about the turnover of the café and the presence of resident artists.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Reliance on Misrepresentation**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA 1830/2013, the Defendant relied on Mr. Chua's misrepresentations to enter into the Second Agreement. In our current case, Rufus relied on Lillabeth's misrepresentations to purchase the café.
  
- **Legal Concept 3: Inducement to Enter into a Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA 1830/2013, the misrepresentations induced the Defendant to enter into the Second Agreement. In our current case, the misrepresentations induced Rufus to purchase the café.
  
- **Legal Concept 4: Right to Rescind the Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCA 1830/2013, the court found that the Defendant was entitled to rescind the contract due to the misrepresentations. In our current case, Rufus may seek to rescind the contract based on the misrepresentations made by Lillabeth.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA 1830/2013)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of actionable misrepresentation, reliance on the misrepresentation, inducement to enter into a contract, and the right to rescind the contract, the court should decide that the representee is entitled to rescind the contract and claim damages. This rule was justified in HCA 1830/2013 because the positive effects of allowing the representee to rescind the contract and claim damages (such as upholding the integrity of contractual agreements and protecting parties from fraudulent or negligent misrepresentations) outweigh the negative effects (such as potential disruption to contractual stability) in that case.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA 1830/2013 BETWEEN MIDLAND REALTY (COMM. & IND.) LIMITED Plaintiff and NCF (HK) LIMITED Defendant) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Actionable Misrepresentation**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA 1830/2013, Mr. Chua made false representations about the rescindability of the First Agreement. In our current case, Lillabeth made false representations about the turnover of the café and the presence of resident artists.

- **Legal Concept 2: Reliance on Misrepresentation**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA 1830/2013, the Defendant relied on Mr. Chua's misrepresentations to enter into the Second Agreement. In our current case, Rufus relied on Lillabeth's misrepresentations to purchase the café.

- **Legal Concept 3: Inducement to Enter into a Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA 1830/2013, the misrepresentations induced the Defendant to enter into the Second Agreement. In our current case, the misrepresentations induced Rufus to purchase the café.

- **Legal Concept 4: Right to Rescind the Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCA 1830/2013, the court found that the Defendant was entitled to rescind the contract due to the misrepresentations. In our current case, Rufus may seek to rescind the contract based on the misrepresentations made by Lillabeth.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome: Rufus should be entitled to rescind the contract and claim damages for misrepresentation. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA 1830/2013, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding the Integrity of Contractual Agreements**: Allowing Rufus to rescind the contract and claim damages would reinforce the principle that parties must be truthful and accurate in their representations when entering into contracts. This upholds the integrity of contractual agreements and ensures that parties can trust the information provided to them.

2. **Protecting Parties from Fraudulent or Negligent Misrepresentations**: By allowing Rufus to rescind the contract, the court would protect him from the financial harm caused by Lillabeth's false representations. This serves as a deterrent against fraudulent or negligent behavior in commercial transactions.

3. **Ensuring Fairness and Justice**: Rescinding the contract and awarding damages to Rufus would ensure that he is not unfairly burdened by the consequences of Lillabeth's misrepresentations. This promotes fairness and justice in contractual dealings.

4. **Encouraging Due Diligence**: While Rufus did not inspect the account books due to their condition, the court's decision would emphasize the importance of due diligence. It would also highlight that parties making representations must ensure their accuracy, as they will be held accountable for any false statements.

Therefore, given the shared fact patterns and the positive effects on the underlying values and principles of the law, the court should allow Rufus to rescind the contract and claim damages for misrepresentation.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA 1830/2013 BETWEEN MIDLAND REALTY (COMM. & IND.) LIMITED Plaintiff and NCF (HK) LIMITED Defendant, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the misrepresentation was made by a professional estate agent, Mr. Chua, who was acting within the scope of his employment. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as upholding the integrity of professional services and protecting clients from professional negligence, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it established a higher standard of care and accountability for professionals in their field. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of professional misrepresentation is notably absent as Lillabeth is not a professional estate agent but rather the owner of the café. This distinction may affect the court's assessment of the standard of care and the expectations of accuracy in the representations made.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in HCA 1830/2013 BETWEEN MIDLAND REALTY (COMM. & IND.) LIMITED Plaintiff and NCF (HK) LIMITED Defendant. This factor is the significant change in circumstances due to the construction of the bypass around Little Butte, which has caused a substantial fall in the amount of passing trade. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of misrepresentation and reliance because it introduces an external event that impacts the business's turnover independently of the misrepresentation. Due to this change in circumstances, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as unfairly attributing the entire loss of business to Lillabeth's misrepresentation, than positive ones, unlike in HCA 1830/2013. The bypass construction is an intervening event that Rufus could argue should be considered separately from the misrepresentation when assessing damages.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA 1830/2013 BETWEEN MIDLAND REALTY (COMM. & IND.) LIMITED Plaintiff and NCF (HK) LIMITED Defendant should be stated as: "When both [the fact pattern of actionable misrepresentation, reliance on the misrepresentation, inducement to enter into a contract, and the right to rescind the contract] and [the misrepresentation being made by a professional within the scope of their employment] are present, the court should decide [that the representee is entitled to rescind the contract and claim damages]." Omitting [the misrepresentation being made by a professional within the scope of their employment] from this rule could lead to [an undesirable consequence where individuals who are not professionals and who do not have the same duty of care are held to the same stringent standards, potentially leading to unfair liability and discouraging ordinary business transactions]. Indeed, the opinion in HCA 1830/2013 explicitly states that the professional status and the scope of employment of Mr. Chua were crucial to their decision, as it established a higher standard of care and accountability.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA 1830/2013 was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of professionals in positions of trust and responsibility making negligent or fraudulent misrepresentations without being held accountable, thereby undermining the integrity of professional services]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [this specific undesirable consequence occurring] because Lillabeth is not a professional estate agent but rather the owner of the café. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should consider the specific circumstances of the case, including the impact of the bypass construction and the fact that Lillabeth is not a professional, when determining whether Rufus is entitled to rescind the contract and claim damages.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of the misrepresentation being made by a professional within the scope of their employment, which was present in the precedent case HCA 1830/2013 BETWEEN MIDLAND REALTY (COMM. & IND.) LIMITED Plaintiff and NCF (HK) LIMITED Defendant, requiring this factor for all similar cases of actionable misrepresentation, reliance on the misrepresentation, inducement to enter into a contract, and the right to rescind the contract would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would create an unfair distinction between misrepresentations made by professionals and those made by non-professionals, potentially allowing non-professionals to escape liability for their false statements. Conversely, not requiring the professional status would allow for a more equitable application of the law, ensuring that all parties are held accountable for their misrepresentations, regardless of their professional status. This better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, which aim to protect parties from fraudulent or negligent misrepresentations and uphold the integrity of contractual agreements.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of the misrepresentation being made by a professional within the scope of their employment, which was present in HCA 1830/2013 BETWEEN MIDLAND REALTY (COMM. & IND.) LIMITED Plaintiff and NCF (HK) LIMITED Defendant, we have the additional factor of a significant change in circumstances due to the construction of the bypass around Little Butte. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of actionable misrepresentation, reliance on the misrepresentation, inducement to enter into a contract, and the right to rescind the contract, serves a similar function to the professional status in the precedent case. Given the presence of this significant change in circumstances, we submit that the reasoning in HCA 1830/2013 still applies, as the positive effects on protecting parties from misrepresentations and ensuring fairness in contractual dealings would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. The bypass construction introduces an external event that impacts the business's turnover independently of the misrepresentation, which should be considered when assessing damages.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA 1830/2013 BETWEEN MIDLAND REALTY (COMM. & IND.) LIMITED Plaintiff and NCF (HK) LIMITED Defendant, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as actionable misrepresentation, reliance on the misrepresentation, inducement to enter into a contract, and the right to rescind the contract. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of a professional relationship and the impact of an external event (the construction of the bypass).

The proposed legal rule of allowing the representee to rescind the contract and claim damages when there is actionable misrepresentation, reliance, inducement, and the right to rescind finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the distinctions.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the professional status of the misrepresentor in the precedent case established a higher standard of care and accountability, and the counterargument that requiring professional status for all similar cases would create an unfair distinction and potentially allow non-professionals to escape liability.

Considering the underlying legal principles of protecting parties from fraudulent or negligent misrepresentations, upholding the integrity of contractual agreements, and ensuring fairness and justice, we conclude that Rufus should be entitled to rescind the contract and claim damages for misrepresentation. This decision aligns with the precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by holding all parties accountable for their misrepresentations, regardless of their professional status.

Key factors influencing this outcome include the clear false representations made by Lillabeth, Rufus's reliance on these representations, and the inducement to enter into the contract. While the bypass construction is an external event, it does not negate the fact that Rufus was misled by Lillabeth's statements about the turnover and the presence of resident artists. Therefore, Rufus has a valid claim for misrepresentation.

### Minor Premise:

1. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1:
- Rufus has entered into a contract with Lillabeth after a misrepresentation.
- The misrepresentation was made to him by Lillabeth.
- Rufus has suffered loss as a result of the misrepresentation, as the turnover was significantly less than represented.
- If Lillabeth had made the misrepresentation fraudulently, she would have been liable to damages.
- Lillabeth did not have reasonable grounds to believe that the facts represented were true, as the turnover figures were significantly inflated.
- Therefore, this section applies, and Lillabeth is liable to damages.

2. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2:
- Rufus has entered into a contract to purchase the café.
- Lillabeth's claim about the turnover is a misrepresentation.
- Rufus entered into the contract after this misrepresentation was made to him.
- The misrepresentation was not made to him fraudulently.
- Rufus would be entitled, by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract.
- Rufus may claim in proceedings that the contract ought to be rescinded.
- Balancing the nature of the misrepresentation,
  * it is a negligent misrepresentation and materially affects the value of the business;
  * the loss that would be suffered by Rufus if the contract was upheld is substantial due to the lower turnover;
  * the loss to Lillabeth if rescission were granted would be significant but justified given the misrepresentation.
- Therefore, this section applies, and the court may declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission.

### Conclusion:

Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1 and 2 apply. Lillabeth is liable to damages for the misrepresentation, and the court may declare the contract subsisting and award Rufus damages in lieu of rescission.

### Major Premise:

1. Glory Gold Limited v Star Play Development Limited

   Conditions:
   - A party makes a representation of fact based on their present intention as to their future action
   - The representation is relied upon by the other party

   Consequences:
   - The representation can be the basis for a claim of misrepresentation, which may be fraudulent, negligent, or innocent

   Exceptions:
   - The representation is merely a promise without any present intention
   - The misrepresentation is not sufficiently pleaded

### Minor Premise:

1. Conditions:
   - Lillabeth made a representation of fact regarding the turnover of the café, stating that £65,000 of the income is derived from the café sales, £30,000 from art sales, and £5,000 from rentals.
   - Rufus relied upon this representation when deciding to purchase the café.

2. Consequences:
   - The representation can be the basis for a claim of misrepresentation, which may be fraudulent, negligent, or innocent.

3. Exceptions:
   - The representation was not merely a promise without any present intention; it was a factual statement about the current turnover.
   - The misrepresentation can be sufficiently pleaded as Rufus discovered that the total turnover had never been more than £50,000, indicating a clear discrepancy.

### Conclusion:

Rufus has a potential claim against Lillabeth on the grounds of misrepresentation. The representation made by Lillabeth regarding the turnover of the café was relied upon by Rufus and was factually incorrect. This misrepresentation can be the basis for a claim, which may be fraudulent, negligent, or innocent, depending on the evidence of Lillabeth's knowledge and intent.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (Wide Link Limited v Tam Sing Cheong)
In the case of Wide Link Limited v Tam Sing Cheong (precedent p), the court ruled that the vendors were in a position to enforce the agreement and provide good title, which could be forced upon the purchaser by way of specific performance. The court held that there was substantial performance by the vendors, and the purchaser's reliance on immaterial features to assert repudiation by non-performance was not justified. The vendors' appeal was allowed, and the judgment for the purchaser was set aside.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in Wide Link Limited v Tam Sing Cheong and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Misrepresentation**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In Wide Link Limited, the purchaser alleged misrepresentation regarding the tenancy terms. In our current case, Rufus was misled about the turnover and the status of the artists' rented workspaces.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Substantial Performance**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In Wide Link Limited, the vendors were able to substantially perform the contract by providing good title. In our current case, Lillabeth's representation of the turnover and the artists' presence was a significant part of the contract's value to Rufus.
  
- **Legal Concept 3: Reliance on Immaterial Features**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In Wide Link Limited, the court found that the purchaser relied on immaterial features to assert repudiation. In our current case, Rufus relied on the turnover figures and the presence of artists, which turned out to be false.
  
- **Legal Concept 4: Specific Performance**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In Wide Link Limited, the court considered whether specific performance was appropriate given the vendors' ability to provide good title. In our current case, the question is whether Rufus can enforce the contract or seek rescission based on the misrepresentation.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (Wide Link Limited v Tam Sing Cheong)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern involving misrepresentation about material aspects of a contract (i*), the court should decide whether the misrepresentation was substantial enough to justify rescission or if the contract can still be enforced through specific performance (outcome o). This rule was justified in Wide Link Limited v Tam Sing Cheong because the court found that the vendors were able to substantially perform the contract and provide good title, and the purchaser's reliance on immaterial features did not justify rescission. The positive effects (E+) of this outcome include upholding the integrity of contractual agreements and ensuring that parties cannot escape their obligations based on minor or immaterial misrepresentations. The negative effects (E-) are minimized as the court ensures that substantial performance is achieved, protecting the interests of both parties.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (Wide Link Limited v Tam Sing Cheong) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Misrepresentation**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In Wide Link Limited, the purchaser alleged misrepresentation regarding the tenancy terms. In our current case, Rufus was misled about the turnover and the status of the artists' rented workspaces.

- **Legal Concept 2: Substantial Performance**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In Wide Link Limited, the vendors were able to substantially perform the contract by providing good title. In our current case, Lillabeth's representation of the turnover and the artists' presence was a significant part of the contract's value to Rufus.

- **Legal Concept 3: Reliance on Immaterial Features**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In Wide Link Limited, the court found that the purchaser relied on immaterial features to assert repudiation. In our current case, Rufus relied on the turnover figures and the presence of artists, which turned out to be false.

- **Legal Concept 4: Specific Performance**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In Wide Link Limited, the court considered whether specific performance was appropriate given the vendors' ability to provide good title. In our current case, the question is whether Rufus can enforce the contract or seek rescission based on the misrepresentation.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in Wide Link Limited v Tam Sing Cheong. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Contractual Integrity**: Enforcing the contract or providing specific performance ensures that parties cannot escape their obligations based on minor or immaterial misrepresentations. This upholds the integrity of contractual agreements and promotes certainty in commercial transactions.

2. **Ensuring Substantial Performance**: The court in Wide Link Limited emphasized that substantial performance by the vendors was sufficient to enforce the contract. Similarly, if Lillabeth can provide substantial performance by delivering the café with the stated turnover and the ability to sell artists' work, Rufus should not be able to rescind the contract based on the misrepresentation about the artists' rented workspaces.

3. **Minimizing Negative Effects**: By focusing on substantial performance and the material aspects of the contract, the court minimizes the negative effects of allowing parties to rescind contracts based on immaterial or minor misrepresentations. This approach protects the interests of both parties and promotes fairness in contractual dealings.

4. **Promoting Commercial Stability**: Enforcing contracts where substantial performance is possible promotes stability and predictability in commercial transactions. This is particularly important in the context of property and business sales, where parties rely on the certainty of their agreements.

In conclusion, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns as Wide Link Limited v Tam Sing Cheong, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would uphold the integrity of contractual agreements, ensure substantial performance, minimize negative effects, and promote commercial stability.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **Wide Link Limited v Tam Sing Cheong**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the vendors' ability to **substantially perform** the contract by providing good title and enforcing the agreement through specific performance. This substantial performance was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as upholding contractual integrity and ensuring that parties cannot escape their obligations based on minor or immaterial misrepresentations, outweighed any potential drawbacks. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of **substantial performance** is notably absent. Lillabeth's misrepresentation about the turnover and the status of the artists' rented workspaces directly impacts the core value of the business that Rufus was purchasing. Unlike the vendors in the precedent case, Lillabeth cannot provide the same substantial performance because the actual turnover is significantly lower than represented, and the artists' rented workspaces are no longer part of the business.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, **the substantial drop in passing trade due to the newly built bypass**, that was not present in **Wide Link Limited v Tam Sing Cheong**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of misrepresentation and substantial performance. Because of the bypass, the café's location has lost a significant amount of its passing trade, which directly impacts the business's viability and profitability. Due to this factor, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as Rufus being stuck with a business that cannot generate the represented turnover, than positive ones. Unlike in **Wide Link Limited v Tam Sing Cheong**, where the vendors could still provide substantial performance, the bypass in our current case fundamentally changes the business's value and potential, making the misrepresentation about turnover and the artists' rented workspaces even more material and detrimental to Rufus.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **Wide Link Limited v Tam Sing Cheong** should be stated as "When both [misrepresentation about material aspects of a contract] and [the inability to provide substantial performance] are present, the court should decide [to allow rescission of the contract]." Omitting [the inability to provide substantial performance] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of enforcing contracts where the core value of the agreement has been fundamentally misrepresented and cannot be substantially performed, thereby causing significant financial harm to the misled party]. Indeed, the opinion in **Wide Link Limited v Tam Sing Cheong** explicitly states that [the vendors' ability to provide substantial performance was crucial to their decision, as it ensured that the purchaser received what was materially agreed upon].

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **Wide Link Limited v Tam Sing Cheong** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of allowing parties to escape their contractual obligations based on minor or immaterial misrepresentations]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [this undesirable consequence occurring] because the misrepresentation about the turnover and the status of the artists' rented workspaces is material and directly impacts the core value of the business. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should allow rescission of the contract due to the material misrepresentation and the inability to provide substantial performance, thereby protecting Rufus from significant financial harm.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the vendors' ability to provide substantial performance, which was present in the precedent case **Wide Link Limited v Tam Sing Cheong**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of misrepresentation about material aspects of a contract would lead to the undesirable consequence of enforcing contracts where the core value of the agreement has been fundamentally misrepresented and cannot be substantially performed, thereby causing significant financial harm to the misled party. Conversely, not requiring substantial performance would allow for the desirable outcome of protecting parties from entering into contracts based on material misrepresentations, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and equity in contract law. This approach ensures that parties are not unfairly bound to agreements that do not reflect the true nature of the transaction, thereby promoting honesty and transparency in commercial dealings.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the vendors' ability to provide substantial performance, which was present in **Wide Link Limited v Tam Sing Cheong**, we have the additional factor of a substantial drop in passing trade due to the newly built bypass. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of misrepresentation about material aspects of the contract, serves a similar function to substantial performance in the precedent case. Given the presence of the bypass, we submit that the reasoning in **Wide Link Limited v Tam Sing Cheong** still applies, as the positive effects on protecting the integrity of contractual agreements and ensuring fairness in commercial transactions would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. The bypass fundamentally changes the business's value and potential, making the misrepresentation about turnover and the artists' rented workspaces even more material and detrimental to Rufus. Therefore, allowing rescission of the contract in this case would uphold the principles of fairness and equity, ensuring that parties are not unfairly bound to agreements based on significant misrepresentations.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **Wide Link Limited v Tam Sing Cheong**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of misrepresentation about material aspects of the contract and the reliance on these misrepresentations by the purchaser. However, it also differs significantly in that the vendors in **Wide Link Limited v Tam Sing Cheong** were able to provide substantial performance, whereas Lillabeth in the current case cannot provide substantial performance due to the misrepresented turnover and the absence of the artists' rented workspaces.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case, which emphasizes the importance of substantial performance in determining whether a contract can be enforced or rescinded, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the unique circumstances of the current case, such as the substantial drop in passing trade due to the newly built bypass.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the vendors' ability to provide substantial performance in the precedent case and the material impact of the misrepresentation and the bypass in the current case. Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, equity, and the protection of parties from entering into contracts based on significant misrepresentations, we conclude that Rufus has a valid claim against Lillabeth on the grounds of misrepresentation.

The decision is reached because the misrepresentation about the turnover and the status of the artists' rented workspaces is material and directly impacts the core value of the business. Additionally, the substantial drop in passing trade due to the bypass further diminishes the business's value and potential, making the misrepresentation even more detrimental to Rufus. Therefore, allowing rescission of the contract in this case would uphold the principles of fairness and equity, ensuring that parties are not unfairly bound to agreements based on significant misrepresentations.

In conclusion, Rufus should be entitled to rescind the contract and seek recovery of any monies paid, along with potential damages and costs, due to the material misrepresentation by Lillabeth and the inability to provide substantial performance. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency.

### Minor Premise:

1. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 2:
- Rufus has entered into a contract with Lillabeth after a misrepresentation has been made to him.
- The misrepresentation regarding the turnover and the artists' rented workspaces has become a term of the contract.
- The contract has been performed.
- Rufus would be entitled to rescind the contract without alleging fraud.
- Therefore, Rufus shall be entitled to rescind the contract, subject to the provisions of the Ordinance.

2. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1:
- Rufus has entered into a contract with Lillabeth after a misrepresentation.
- The misrepresentation was made to him by Lillabeth.
- Rufus has suffered loss as a result of the misrepresentation (the actual turnover is significantly less than represented).
- If Lillabeth had made the misrepresentation fraudulently, she would be liable to damages.
- Lillabeth may argue that she had reasonable grounds to believe that the facts represented were true and that she did believe up to the time the contract was made that the facts represented were true.
- However, given the significant discrepancy in turnover, it is unlikely that Lillabeth can prove she had reasonable grounds to believe the facts represented were true.
- Therefore, Lillabeth shall still be liable to damages even though the misrepresentation was not made fraudulently.

3. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2:
- Rufus has entered into a contract to purchase the café.
- The misrepresentation regarding the turnover and the artists' rented workspaces was made to him.
- The misrepresentation was not made to him fraudulently.
- Rufus would be entitled, by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract.
- It is claimed in any proceedings arising out of the contract that the contract ought to be or has been rescinded.
- The court or arbitrator would likely find it equitable to declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission, considering:
  * The nature of the misrepresentation (significant discrepancy in turnover).
  * The loss that would be caused by it if the contract were upheld (Rufus would suffer financial loss).
  * The loss that rescission would cause to Lillabeth (potentially significant but less than the loss to Rufus).

### Conclusion:

Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 2, Section 3 Subsection 1, and Section 3 Subsection 2 apply. Rufus is entitled to rescind the contract or, alternatively, the court may declare the contract subsisting and award Rufus damages in lieu of rescission.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited)
In the case of Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering (ADS) v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited (WM) (precedent p), ADS alleged that WM and its directors made misrepresentations about the financial position of WMI, knowing them to be false or being reckless as to their truth. The court ruled that for fraudulent misrepresentation, the representation must be made with knowledge that it is false or without any genuine belief that it is true. The court found no fraudulent intent or recklessness in the representations made by WM and its directors. Therefore, the claim for fraudulent misrepresentation was dismissed.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Representation of Fact**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, there were representations made about the financial status of a business. In precedent p, WM made representations about WMI's financial health. In the current case, Lillabeth made representations about the turnover of the café.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Knowledge of Falsity or Recklessness**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In both cases, the representations were alleged to be made with knowledge of their falsity or recklessly. In precedent p, ADS alleged that WM knew the financial representations were false. In the current case, Rufus can argue that Lillabeth knew or was reckless about the true turnover figures.
  
- **Legal Concept 3: Inducement to Enter Contract**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In both cases, the representations were made to induce the other party to enter into a contract. In precedent p, ADS entered into guarantees based on WM's representations. In the current case, Rufus entered into the contract to purchase the café based on Lillabeth's representations.
  
- **Legal Concept 4: Actual Reliance and Damage**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In both cases, the plaintiff relied on the representations and suffered damage as a result. In precedent p, ADS suffered financial loss due to reliance on WM's representations. In the current case, Rufus suffered financial loss due to the misrepresented turnover and the impact of the bypass.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a representation of fact made with knowledge of its falsity or recklessness, intended to induce the other party to enter into a contract, and resulting in actual reliance and damage, the court should decide in favor of the plaintiff for misrepresentation. This rule was justified in Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited because the court carefully examined the elements of fraudulent misrepresentation and found that the absence of genuine belief in the truth of the representation was crucial. The positive effects (E+) of this outcome on the underlying values and principles of the law, such as promoting honesty and fairness in contractual dealings, outweigh the negative effects (E-) in that case.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Representation of Fact**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, there were representations made about the financial status of a business. In precedent p, WM made representations about WMI's financial health. In the current case, Lillabeth made representations about the turnover of the café.

- **Legal Concept 2: Knowledge of Falsity or Recklessness**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In both cases, the representations were alleged to be made with knowledge of their falsity or recklessly. In precedent p, ADS alleged that WM knew the financial representations were false. In the current case, Rufus can argue that Lillabeth knew or was reckless about the true turnover figures.

- **Legal Concept 3: Inducement to Enter Contract**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In both cases, the representations were made to induce the other party to enter into a contract. In precedent p, ADS entered into guarantees based on WM's representations. In the current case, Rufus entered into the contract to purchase the café based on Lillabeth's representations.

- **Legal Concept 4: Actual Reliance and Damage**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In both cases, the plaintiff relied on the representations and suffered damage as a result. In precedent p, ADS suffered financial loss due to reliance on WM's representations. In the current case, Rufus suffered financial loss due to the misrepresented turnover and the impact of the bypass.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome, which is to find in favor of the plaintiff for misrepresentation. This decision would be justified because, as in Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Promoting Honesty and Fairness in Contractual Dealings**: Holding Lillabeth accountable for her misrepresentations would reinforce the principle that parties must be honest and transparent in their business dealings. This promotes trust and integrity in commercial transactions.

2. **Deterring Fraudulent and Reckless Behavior**: A ruling in favor of Rufus would serve as a deterrent to others who might consider making false or reckless statements to induce contracts. It sends a clear message that such behavior will not be tolerated and will have legal consequences.

3. **Protecting the Interests of the Innocent Party**: By ruling in favor of Rufus, the court would protect the interests of individuals who rely on the representations of others when entering into contracts. This ensures that they are not unfairly disadvantaged or financially harmed by deceitful practices.

4. **Encouraging Due Diligence**: While Rufus did not inspect the account books due to their condition, the ruling would emphasize the importance of due diligence. It would highlight that while parties should verify information, the onus remains on the representor to provide accurate and truthful information.

Therefore, given the shared fact patterns and the positive effects on the underlying values and principles of the law, the court should find in favor of Rufus for misrepresentation.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the planned bypass around Little Butte, that was not present in the precedent case, Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of inducement to enter a contract based on misrepresentation.

The bypass has caused a substantial fall in the amount of passing trade, which directly impacts the turnover of the café. This factor introduces an additional layer of complexity because it affects the viability and profitability of the business in a way that was not considered in the precedent case. In Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering, the court focused on the representations made about the financial health of the business without any external changes affecting the business environment.

Due to the presence of the bypass, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences than positive ones. Specifically, the negative consequences include:

1. **Unforeseen External Factors**: The bypass is an external factor that Rufus could not have anticipated and which significantly impacts the business's turnover. This makes the misrepresentation about the turnover even more detrimental to Rufus, as the actual business environment has changed unfavorably.

2. **Increased Financial Loss**: The bypass likely exacerbates Rufus's financial loss, as the expected turnover based on Lillabeth's representations is now even less achievable. This increases the disparity between the represented and actual financial performance of the café.

3. **Fairness and Equity**: Holding Rufus to the same standard as in the precedent case would be unfair, given the additional adverse impact of the bypass. It would not be equitable to ignore this significant change in circumstances that directly affects the business's viability.

Therefore, the presence of the bypass in the current case significantly alters the balance of positive and negative effects. Applying the same outcome as in Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited would not adequately address the unique challenges and increased financial harm faced by Rufus due to this external factor.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited** should be stated as: "When both [a representation of fact made with knowledge of its falsity or recklessness, intended to induce the other party to enter into a contract, and resulting in actual reliance and damage] and [an unforeseen external factor significantly impacting the business environment] are present, the court should decide [in favor of the plaintiff for misrepresentation]." Omitting [the unforeseen external factor significantly impacting the business environment] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of unfairly holding the plaintiff to a misrepresented contract despite significant changes in circumstances that exacerbate the financial harm]. 

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of allowing parties to escape liability for fraudulent or reckless misrepresentations]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [allowing parties to escape liability for fraudulent or reckless misrepresentations] occurring because the presence of the bypass introduces an additional layer of complexity that significantly impacts the business's viability and Rufus's financial harm. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the specific factor of "knowledge of falsity or recklessness" (factor m), which was present in the precedent case **Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of misrepresentation would lead to the undesirable consequence of allowing parties to escape liability for negligent misrepresentation. Conversely, not requiring "knowledge of falsity or recklessness" would allow for a more comprehensive protection of parties who rely on representations when entering into contracts. This better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, which aim to promote honesty, fairness, and accountability in contractual dealings.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the specific factor of "knowledge of falsity or recklessness" (factor m), which was present in **Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited**, we have the additional factor of "an unforeseen external factor significantly impacting the business environment" (factor n). This factor n, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of misrepresentation inducing a contract (fact pattern i*), serves a similar function to factor m in the precedent case. Given the presence of factor n, we submit that the reasoning in **Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited** still applies, as the positive effects on promoting honesty, fairness, and accountability in contractual dealings would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the representation of fact, knowledge of falsity or recklessness, inducement to enter a contract, and actual reliance and damage. However, it also differs significantly due to the unforeseen external factor of the bypass, which has a substantial impact on the business environment and Rufus's financial harm.

The proposed legal rule of "When both [a representation of fact made with knowledge of its falsity or recklessness, intended to induce the other party to enter into a contract, and resulting in actual reliance and damage] and [an unforeseen external factor significantly impacting the business environment] are present, the court should decide [in favor of the plaintiff for misrepresentation]" finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the presence of the bypass introduces an additional layer of complexity that significantly impacts the business's viability and Rufus's financial harm. This factor was not present in the precedent case, and ignoring it would lead to an unfair outcome for Rufus. On the other hand, the precedent emphasizes the importance of knowledge of falsity or recklessness in establishing fraudulent misrepresentation.

Considering the underlying legal principles of promoting honesty, fairness, and accountability in contractual dealings, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Rufus has a valid claim against Lillabeth on the grounds of misrepresentation. The presence of the bypass exacerbates the financial harm caused by the misrepresentation, making it equitable to hold Lillabeth accountable for her false statements about the turnover of the café.

Therefore, the court should find in favor of Rufus for misrepresentation, taking into account both the misrepresented turnover figures and the significant impact of the bypass on the business environment. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by addressing the unique challenges and increased financial harm faced by Rufus.

### Minor Premise:

1. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1:
- Rufus has entered into a contract with Lillabeth after a misrepresentation.
- The misrepresentation was made to him by Lillabeth.
- Rufus has suffered loss as a result of the misrepresentation, as the turnover was significantly less than represented.
- If Lillabeth had made the misrepresentation fraudulently, she would have been liable to damages.
- Lillabeth did not have reasonable grounds to believe that the facts represented were true, as the turnover figures were significantly inflated.
- Therefore, this section applies, and Lillabeth is liable to damages.

2. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2:
- Rufus has entered into a contract to purchase the café.
- Lillabeth's claim about the turnover is a misrepresentation.

- Balancing the nature of the misrepresentation,
  * it is a material misrepresentation affecting the value of the business;
  * the loss that would be suffered by Rufus if the contract was upheld is substantial due to the lower turnover;
  * the loss to Lillabeth if rescission were granted would be significant but justified given the misrepresentation.
- Therefore, this section applies, and the court may declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission.

### Conclusion:

Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1 and 2 apply. Lillabeth is liable to damages for the misrepresentation, and the court may declare the contract subsisting and award Rufus damages in lieu of rescission.

   - The misrepresentation or non-disclosure was intentional or inadvertent.

   Consequences:
   - The court may set aside the consent order.

   Exceptions:
   - The party who has failed to disclose can prove, on the balance of probabilities, that the order would have been substantially the same even had full disclosure been made.

### Minor Premise:

1. GM-SA AKA DG, M-S v. DDPJ [2022] HKCA 870:
   - There is a misrepresentation by Lillabeth regarding the turnover of the café business.
   - The misrepresentation is material to Rufus's decision to purchase the café, as he relied on the stated turnover figures.
   - The misrepresentation was intentional or inadvertent, as Lillabeth provided incorrect turnover figures and did not disclose the artists' relocation.
   - Rufus entered into the contract based on these misrepresentations, and the actual turnover was significantly lower than represented.
   - The planned bypass, which was not disclosed, also materially affected the business's turnover.

   Exceptions:
   - Lillabeth cannot prove, on the balance of probabilities, that the order (the contract) would have been substantially the same even had full disclosure been made, as the actual turnover and the impact of the bypass are significantly different from what was represented.

### Conclusion:

GM-SA AKA DG, M-S v. DDPJ [2022] HKCA 870 applies, and the court may set aside the consent order (the contract) due to the material misrepresentation by Lillabeth. Rufus has a potential claim against Lillabeth on the grounds of misrepresentation.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (CACV000205/2000)

In the case of CACV000205/2000 (precedent p), the facts were as follows: Green Park Properties Limited (the plaintiff) entered into a Provisional Agreement for Sale and Purchase with Dorku Limited (the defendant) for the sale of property. The property was shown to include a yard, which was actually part of the common area and not owned by the vendor. The court ruled that there was a misrepresentation by the vendor, which entitled the purchaser to rescind the agreement.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in CACV000205/2000 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Misrepresentation by Conduct**: In CACV000205/2000, the vendor's conduct (showing the property including the yard) led the purchaser to believe that the yard was part of the property. In our current case, Lillabeth's conduct (providing turnover figures and showing the café) led Rufus to believe that the turnover was £100,000 and that the artists were still renting space.
  
- **Material Misrepresentation**: In CACV000205/2000, the misrepresentation about the yard was material to the purchaser's decision to enter into the contract. In our current case, the misrepresentation about the turnover and the artists' rental spaces is material to Rufus's decision to purchase the café.

- **Duty of Disclosure**: In CACV000205/2000, the vendor had a duty to disclose that the yard was not part of the property. In our current case, Lillabeth had a duty to disclose the true turnover and the fact that the artists had moved out.

- **Caveat Emptor (Buyer Beware)**: In both cases, the principle of caveat emptor is relevant. However, in CACV000205/2000, the court found that the misrepresentation overrode this principle. Similarly, in our current case, the misrepresentation by Lillabeth could override the principle of caveat emptor.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (CACV000205/2000)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of material misrepresentation by conduct, the court should decide that the misled party is entitled to rescind the contract. This rule was justified in CACV000205/2000 because the positive effects (E+) of allowing rescission for misrepresentation uphold the principles of fairness and honesty in contractual dealings, outweighing the negative effects (E-) of potentially disrupting contractual stability.

Applying this rule to our current case, Rufus has a potential claim against Lillabeth on the grounds of misrepresentation. The misrepresentation about the turnover and the artists' rental spaces was material and likely induced Rufus to enter into the contract. Therefore, Rufus should be entitled to rescind the contract.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (CACV000205/2000) are present:

- **Misrepresentation by Conduct**: In CACV000205/2000, the vendor's conduct (showing the property including the yard) led the purchaser to believe that the yard was part of the property. In our current case, Lillabeth's conduct (providing turnover figures and showing the café) led Rufus to believe that the turnover was £100,000 and that the artists were still renting space.

- **Material Misrepresentation**: In CACV000205/2000, the misrepresentation about the yard was material to the purchaser's decision to enter into the contract. In our current case, the misrepresentation about the turnover and the artists' rental spaces is material to Rufus's decision to purchase the café.

- **Duty of Disclosure**: In CACV000205/2000, the vendor had a duty to disclose that the yard was not part of the property. In our current case, Lillabeth had a duty to disclose the true turnover and the fact that the artists had moved out.

- **Caveat Emptor (Buyer Beware)**: In both cases, the principle of caveat emptor is relevant. However, in CACV000205/2000, the court found that the misrepresentation overrode this principle. Similarly, in our current case, the misrepresentation by Lillabeth could override the principle of caveat emptor.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome: Rufus should be entitled to rescind the contract on the grounds of misrepresentation. This decision would be justified because, as in CACV000205/2000, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Fairness and Honesty**: Allowing rescission for misrepresentation upholds the principles of fairness and honesty in contractual dealings. It ensures that parties cannot benefit from misleading conduct or statements.

2. **Protecting the Innocent Party**: It protects the innocent party (Rufus) who was induced into the contract based on false information. This aligns with the principle that one should not suffer from another's misrepresentation.

3. **Deterrence**: It serves as a deterrent against misrepresentation in business transactions, promoting transparency and trust in commercial dealings.

4. **Equitable Relief**: Given that the misrepresentation was material and likely induced Rufus to enter into the contract, rescission is an equitable remedy that restores the parties to their original positions.

Therefore, the court should allow Rufus to rescind the contract with Lillabeth, as the positive effects of such a decision on the underlying values and principles of the law would outweigh any negative effects.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the planned bypass around Little Butte, that was not present in CACV000205/2000. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of misrepresentation because the bypass has caused a substantial fall in the amount of passing trade, which directly impacts the turnover and profitability of the café. Due to the bypass, applying the same outcome of allowing rescission in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the stability of commercial transactions and potentially leading to an increase in litigation over changes in external circumstances, unlike in CACV000205/2000. In the precedent case, the misrepresentation was solely about the property boundaries, which did not involve external factors affecting the business's viability. Therefore, the presence of the bypass in our current case introduces a significant external factor that complicates the issue of misrepresentation and its impact on the contract.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from CACV000205/2000 should be stated as: "When both [misrepresentation by conduct] and [a significant external factor affecting the business's viability] are present, the court should decide [to allow rescission of the contract]." Omitting [a significant external factor affecting the business's viability] from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of undermining the stability of commercial transactions and potentially leading to an increase in litigation over changes in external circumstances. Indeed, the opinion in CACV000205/2000 explicitly states that the misrepresentation was crucial to their decision, but it did not involve external factors affecting the business's viability, which is a significant consideration in our current case.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in CACV000205/2000 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of parties being misled into contracts based on false representations about the subject matter of the sale. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence occurring because the misrepresentation about the turnover and the artists' rental spaces is compounded by the significant external factor of the bypass, which has caused a substantial fall in the amount of passing trade. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—to protect parties from being misled about the subject matter of the sale—does not fully address the complexities introduced by the external factor affecting the business's viability.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the specific factor of a misrepresentation solely about the property boundaries, which was present in the precedent case CACV000205/2000, requiring this factor for all similar cases of misrepresentation in the sale of a business would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would limit the scope of actionable misrepresentation claims to only those involving property boundaries, thereby excluding other significant misrepresentations that could materially affect the decision to enter into a contract. Conversely, not requiring the misrepresentation to be solely about property boundaries would allow for a broader application of the principle that parties should not be misled into contracts based on false representations. This better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness, honesty, and protection of the innocent party in contractual dealings.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the specific factor of a misrepresentation solely about the property boundaries, which was present in CACV000205/2000, we have the additional factor of a significant external change—the construction of a bypass—that has materially affected the business's viability. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of material misrepresentation by conduct, serves a similar function to the misrepresentation about property boundaries in the precedent case. Given the presence of this significant external change, we submit that the reasoning in CACV000205/2000 still applies. The positive effects on relevant legal values, such as upholding fairness and honesty in contractual dealings, protecting the innocent party, and deterring misrepresentation, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. Therefore, Rufus should be entitled to rescind the contract with Lillabeth on the grounds of misrepresentation.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to CACV000205/2000, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of material misrepresentation by conduct and the reliance of the purchaser on the misrepresented facts. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the presence of an external factor—the construction of a bypass—that has materially affected the business's viability.

The proposed legal rule of allowing rescission of the contract in cases of material misrepresentation by conduct finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of upholding fairness and honesty in contractual dealings (a strong point for allowing rescission) and the potential for undermining the stability of commercial transactions due to external factors (a strong point against allowing rescission).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, honesty, and protection of the innocent party, as well as the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Rufus should be entitled to rescind the contract with Lillabeth on the grounds of misrepresentation. The key factors influencing this decision include:

1. **Material Misrepresentation**: Lillabeth's statements about the turnover and the artists' rental spaces were material and likely induced Rufus to enter into the contract.
2. **Duty of Disclosure**: Lillabeth had a duty to disclose the true turnover and the fact that the artists had moved out, which she failed to do.
3. **Impact of External Factors**: While the construction of the bypass is a significant external factor, it does not negate the material misrepresentation made by Lillabeth. The misrepresentation itself is sufficient to justify rescission, as it directly influenced Rufus's decision to purchase the café.

Therefore, the decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency. Rufus is entitled to rescind the contract due to the material misrepresentation by Lillabeth.

### Minor Premise:

1. Residential Properties (First-hand Sales) Ordinance Cap. 621 Section 77:
   - Rufus was induced to purchase the café based on Lillabeth's misrepresentation.
   - Rufus sustained pecuniary loss as a result of reliance on the misrepresentation.
   - However, this section applies specifically to residential properties, and the café is a commercial property. Therefore, this section does not apply.

2. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1:
   - Rufus entered into a contract after a misrepresentation was made to him by Lillabeth.
   - Rufus suffered loss as a result of the misrepresentation (the café's turnover was never more than £50,000).
   - If Lillabeth had made the misrepresentation fraudulently, she would be liable to damages.
   - Lillabeth did not have reasonable grounds to believe that the facts represented were true, as the turnover figures were significantly inflated.
   - Therefore, this section applies, and Lillabeth is liable to damages.

3. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2:
   - Rufus entered into a contract after a misrepresentation was made to him.
   - The misrepresentation was not made fraudulently.
   - Rufus would be entitled, by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract.
   - It is claimed in any proceedings arising out of the contract that the contract ought to be or has been rescinded.
   - The court or arbitrator would likely find it equitable to award damages in lieu of rescission, considering the nature of the misrepresentation and the losses involved.
   - Therefore, this section applies, and the court may declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission.

4. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 2:
   - Rufus entered into a contract after a misrepresentation was made to him.
   - The misrepresentation has become a term of the contract.

He is entitled to rescind the contract and/or claim damages for the pecuniary loss sustained due to the misrepresentation. The presence of mouse droppings and the dirty condition of the outhouse where the account books were stored does not affect the validity of Rufus's reliance on Lillabeth's statements.

   Conditions:
   - The statement is accompanied by a qualification or explanation.
   - The qualification or explanation indicates to a reasonable person that the representor was not assuming responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the statement or was saying no reliance can be placed on it.

   Consequences:
   - The representee is not entitled to rely on the statement.

   Exceptions:

### Minor Premise:

1. Yang Dandan v Hong Kong Resort Company Limited:
- Lillabeth made a statement regarding the turnover of the café, art sales, and rentals.
- Lillabeth invited Rufus to see her account books, which can be considered a qualification or explanation.
- The condition of the outhouse (mouse droppings and dirt) might indicate to a reasonable person that Lillabeth was not assuming responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the statement, as it suggests a lack of proper record-keeping.
- Rufus decided to take Lillabeth's word for it without verifying the account books, which means the qualification or explanation was brought to his attention.
- The qualification or explanation was clear (invitation to see the account books).

### Conclusion:

Rufus is not entitled to rely on Lillabeth's statement regarding the turnover of the café, art sales, and rentals because the qualification or explanation (invitation to see the account books) was clear and brought to his attention. Therefore, Rufus does not have a potential claim against Lillabeth on the grounds of misrepresentation based on the facts provided.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG Plaintiff and MING YIU HENG Defendant)
In the case of HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG Plaintiff and MING YIU HENG Defendant (precedent p), the plaintiff claimed the outstanding balance of the purchase price for shares sold under an equity transfer agreement and sought to void a settlement agreement on the grounds of duress. The defendant counterclaimed for rescission of the equity transfer agreement due to misrepresentation. The court ruled that the defendant was entitled to rescind the equity transfer agreement due to misrepresentation, as the plaintiff had made false representations that induced the defendant to enter into the contract.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA 1584/2010 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Misrepresentation**: In HCA 1584/2010, the plaintiff made false representations about the value and future investment in the company, which induced the defendant to enter into the contract. In our current case, Lillabeth made false representations about the turnover of the café and the presence of resident artists, which induced Rufus to enter into the contract.
- **Reliance on Representation**: In HCA 1584/2010, the defendant relied on the false representations made by the plaintiff. In our current case, Rufus relied on Lillabeth's statements about the turnover and the artists' presence.
- **Opportunity to Discover Truth**: In HCA 1584/2010, the court held that the opportunity to discover the falsity of the representation is not a bar to rescission. In our current case, Rufus had the opportunity to verify the turnover figures by examining the account books but chose not to due to their condition.
- **Outcome of Rescission**: In HCA 1584/2010, the court allowed the rescission of the contract due to misrepresentation. In our current case, Rufus seeks to rescind the contract based on the misrepresentations made by Lillabeth.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA 1584/2010)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of misrepresentation and reliance on that misrepresentation, the court should decide in favor of rescission of the contract. This rule was justified in HCA 1584/2010 because the positive effects (E+) of allowing rescission for misrepresentation uphold the principles of fairness and honesty in contractual dealings, outweighing the negative effects (E-) of potentially allowing parties to avoid contracts based on their own lack of due diligence. Therefore, in our current case, Rufus should be entitled to rescind the contract with Lillabeth due to the misrepresentations about the turnover and the presence of resident artists, despite his failure to verify the information in the account books.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG Plaintiff and MING YIU HENG Defendant) are present:

- **Misrepresentation**: In HCA 1584/2010, the plaintiff made false representations about the value and future investment in the company, which induced the defendant to enter into the contract. Similarly, in our current case, Lillabeth made false representations about the turnover of the café and the presence of resident artists, which induced Rufus to enter into the contract.

- **Reliance on Representation**: In HCA 1584/2010, the defendant relied on the false representations made by the plaintiff. In our current case, Rufus relied on Lillabeth's statements about the turnover and the artists' presence.

- **Opportunity to Discover Truth**: In HCA 1584/2010, the court held that the opportunity to discover the falsity of the representation is not a bar to rescission. In our current case, Rufus had the opportunity to verify the turnover figures by examining the account books but chose not to due to their condition.

- **Outcome of Rescission**: In HCA 1584/2010, the court allowed the rescission of the contract due to misrepresentation. In our current case, Rufus seeks to rescind the contract based on the misrepresentations made by Lillabeth.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome of allowing rescission of the contract. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA 1584/2010, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Fairness and Honesty**: Allowing rescission in cases of misrepresentation upholds the principles of fairness and honesty in contractual dealings. It ensures that parties cannot benefit from deceitful practices.

2. **Deterrence of Misrepresentation**: By allowing rescission, the court sends a strong message that misrepresentation will not be tolerated, thereby deterring parties from making false statements to induce contracts.

3. **Protection of Innocent Parties**: This outcome protects innocent parties like Rufus, who relied on the representations made by Lillabeth and entered into the contract based on those representations.

4. **Consistency in Legal Principles**: Applying the same rule as in HCA 1584/2010 ensures consistency in the application of legal principles, thereby providing predictability and stability in the law.

Therefore, given the shared fact patterns and the positive effects on the underlying values and principles of the law, the court should allow Rufus to rescind the contract with Lillabeth due to the misrepresentations about the turnover and the presence of resident artists, despite his failure to verify the information in the account books.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG Plaintiff and MING YIU HENG Defendant, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the misrepresentations made by the plaintiff were directly related to the core aspects of the contract, such as the value of the shares and the future investment in the company. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as upholding fairness and honesty in contractual dealings, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it directly impacted the defendant's decision to enter into the contract.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as the misrepresentations made by Lillabeth about the turnover and the presence of resident artists, while significant, do not directly relate to the core operational aspects of the café business itself. Rufus had the opportunity to verify the turnover figures by examining the account books but chose not to due to their condition. This introduces an element of contributory negligence on Rufus's part, which was not present in the precedent case.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the presence of mouse droppings and the dirty condition of the outhouse where the account books were stored, that was not present in HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG Plaintiff and MING YIU HENG Defendant. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces a question of whether Rufus's decision not to verify the turnover figures was reasonable under the circumstances.

Due to this factor, applying the same outcome of allowing rescission in our case would have more negative consequences, such as potentially encouraging buyers to neglect due diligence based on minor inconveniences, than positive ones. Unlike in HCA 1584/2010, where the misrepresentations were directly related to the core aspects of the contract and there was no contributory negligence, in our current case, Rufus's failure to verify the information due to the condition of the outhouse introduces a level of contributory negligence that complicates the issue of reliance on the misrepresentation. Therefore, the presence of this factor suggests that the court should consider the reasonableness of Rufus's actions before deciding on rescission.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG Plaintiff and MING YIU HENG Defendant should be stated as "When both [misrepresentation and reliance on that misrepresentation] and [the opportunity to discover the truth but choosing not to due to reasonable circumstances] are present, the court should decide [in favor of rescission]." Omitting [the opportunity to discover the truth but choosing not to due to reasonable circumstances] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of encouraging parties to neglect due diligence based on minor inconveniences, thereby undermining the principle of fairness in contractual dealings]. Indeed, the opinion in HCA 1584/2010 explicitly states that the opportunity to discover the falsity of the representation is not a bar to rescission, emphasizing the importance of the representee's reasonable reliance on the misrepresentation.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA 1584/2010 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of allowing parties to benefit from deceitful practices by making false representations that induce others to enter into contracts. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because Rufus had the opportunity to verify the turnover figures but chose not to due to the condition of the outhouse. This introduces an element of contributory negligence on Rufus's part, which was not present in the precedent case. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—to prevent deceitful practices—is not relevant to our situation where the representee had a reasonable opportunity to discover the truth but chose not to.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of "direct relation to the core operational aspects of the business," which was present in the precedent case HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG Plaintiff and MING YIU HENG Defendant, requiring this factor for all similar cases of misrepresentation and reliance would lead to the undesirable consequence of allowing parties to escape liability for misrepresentations that significantly impact the decision to enter into a contract, even if those misrepresentations are not directly related to the core operations. Conversely, not requiring this factor would allow for a more comprehensive protection against misrepresentation, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and honesty in contractual dealings. This approach ensures that parties cannot benefit from deceitful practices, regardless of whether the misrepresentation pertains to core or ancillary aspects of the business.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of "direct relation to the core operational aspects of the business," which was present in HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG Plaintiff and MING YIU HENG Defendant, we have the additional factor of "the condition of the outhouse where the account books were stored." This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of misrepresentation and reliance, serves a similar function to the core operational aspect in the precedent case. The condition of the outhouse effectively prevented Rufus from verifying the turnover figures, thereby reinforcing his reliance on Lillabeth's representations. Given the presence of this factor, we submit that the reasoning in HCA 1584/2010 still applies, as the positive effects on the principles of fairness and honesty in contractual dealings would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. This ensures that parties are held accountable for their misrepresentations, promoting integrity in business transactions.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG Plaintiff and MING YIU HENG Defendant, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of misrepresentation and reliance on that misrepresentation. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the condition of the outhouse where the account books were stored, which influenced Rufus's decision not to verify the turnover figures.

The proposed legal rule that "when both misrepresentation and reliance on that misrepresentation are present, the court should decide in favor of rescission" finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the contributory negligence introduced by Rufus's failure to verify the information due to the condition of the outhouse.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that allowing rescission upholds the principles of fairness and honesty in contractual dealings (as argued in favor of Rufus) and the counterpoint that Rufus had a reasonable opportunity to discover the truth but chose not to (as argued against Rufus).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, honesty, and the need to deter deceitful practices, as well as the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Rufus should be entitled to rescind the contract with Lillabeth due to the misrepresentations about the turnover and the presence of resident artists. This decision aligns with the precedent set in HCA 1584/2010 and serves justice by holding parties accountable for their misrepresentations, promoting integrity in business transactions.

Key factors that influenced this outcome include the significant impact of the misrepresentations on Rufus's decision to enter into the contract and the principle that the opportunity to discover the falsity of the representation is not a bar to rescission, as established in Redgrave v Hurd. While Rufus's failure to verify the information due to the condition of the outhouse introduces an element of contributory negligence, it does not outweigh the need to uphold the principles of fairness and honesty in contractual dealings. Therefore, the court should allow Rufus to rescind the contract.

### Minor Premise:

1. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 2:
- Rufus has entered into a contract with Lillabeth after a misrepresentation has been made to him.
- The misrepresentation regarding the turnover has become a term of the contract.
- The contract has been performed.
- Rufus would be entitled to rescind the contract without alleging fraud.
- Therefore, Rufus shall be entitled to rescind the contract, subject to the provisions of this Ordinance.

2. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1:
- Rufus has entered into a contract with Lillabeth after a misrepresentation.
- The misrepresentation regarding the turnover has been made to him by Lillabeth.
- Rufus has suffered loss as a result of the misrepresentation, as the actual turnover is significantly lower than represented.
- If the misrepresentation had been made fraudulently, Lillabeth would be liable to damages.
- Lillabeth has not proven that she had reasonable grounds to believe that the facts represented were true, nor that she believed up to the time the contract was made that the facts represented were true.
- Therefore, Lillabeth shall be liable to damages even though the misrepresentation was not made fraudulently.

3. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 4:
- The contract does not contain a term which would exclude or restrict any liability to which Lillabeth may be subject by reason of any misrepresentation made by her before the contract was made.
- Therefore, this section does not apply.

### Conclusion:

Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 2 and Section 3 Subsection 1 apply. Rufus shall be entitled to rescind the contract, and Lillabeth shall be liable to damages even though the misrepresentation was not made fraudulently.

### Relevant law:

Cai Yi Rui v Chateau Cellar Limited

### Major Premise:

1. Cai Yi Rui v Chateau Cellar Limited

   Conditions:
   - One person induces another to enter into an agreement by a material representation which is untrue.
   - The person to whom the representation was made had the means of discovering, and might, with reasonable diligence, have discovered, that it was untrue.
   - The person making the representation would be liable to damages in respect thereof had the misrepresentation been made fraudulently.

   Consequences:
   - It is no defence to an action to rescind the contract that the person to whom the representation was made had the means of discovering, and might, with reasonable diligence, have discovered, that it was untrue.
   - The person making the representation shall be so liable notwithstanding that the misrepresentation was not made fraudulently.

   Exceptions:
   - The person making the misrepresentation proves that he had reasonable grounds to believe and did believe up to the time the contract was made that the facts represented were true.

### Minor Premise:

1. Cai Yi Rui v Chateau Cellar Limited:
- Lillabeth induced Rufus to enter into an agreement by representing that the turnover of the café was £100,000 p.a., with specific amounts attributed to café sales, art sales, and rentals.
- Rufus had the means of discovering the truth by inspecting the account books, but he chose not to do so due to their condition.
- Lillabeth would be liable to damages if the misrepresentation had been made fraudulently, as the actual turnover was never more than £50,000.
- It is no defence for Lillabeth that Rufus had the means of discovering the truth and might have discovered it with reasonable diligence.
- Lillabeth has not provided evidence that she had reasonable grounds to believe and did believe up to the time the contract was made that the facts represented were true, especially since she knew the artists had moved to the local village hall and the turnover figures were inflated.

### Conclusion:

Cai Yi Rui v Chateau Cellar Limited applies, and Rufus has a potential claim against Lillabeth for misrepresentation. The court would likely allow Rufus to rescind the contract and/or award damages, as Lillabeth's misrepresentation was material and untrue, and she has not proven that she had reasonable grounds to believe the facts represented were true.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA008564/1998 BETWEEN GREEN PARK PROPERTIES LIMITED Plaintiff AND DORKU LIMITED Defendant)
In the case of HCA008564/1998 BETWEEN GREEN PARK PROPERTIES LIMITED Plaintiff AND DORKU LIMITED Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the defendant had misrepresented the property by not disclosing that the yard was not part of the property being sold. The court found that the defendant had a duty to disclose this material fact and that the plaintiff was entitled to rescind the contract and recover the deposit paid.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA008564/1998 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Misrepresentation by Conduct**: In HCA008564/1998, the defendant's conduct in showing the property without disclosing that the yard was not included constituted misrepresentation. In our current case, Lillabeth's conduct in showing the café and providing turnover figures without disclosing the artists' relocation and the bypass constitutes misrepresentation.
- **Duty to Disclose Material Facts**: In HCA008564/1998, the defendant had a duty to disclose that the yard was not part of the property. In our current case, Lillabeth had a duty to disclose the artists' relocation and the impact of the bypass on the business.
- **Reliance on Misrepresentation**: In HCA008564/1998, the plaintiff relied on the misrepresentation in deciding to purchase the property. In our current case, Rufus relied on Lillabeth's representations about the turnover and the artists' presence in deciding to purchase the café.
- **Rescission of Contract**: In HCA008564/1998, the court allowed the plaintiff to rescind the contract due to misrepresentation. In our current case, Rufus seeks to rescind the contract based on similar grounds of misrepresentation.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA008564/1998)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of misrepresentation by conduct and failure to disclose material facts, the court should decide in favor of allowing the rescission of the contract. This rule was justified in HCA008564/1998 because the positive effects (E+) of outcome o on the underlying values and principles of the law, such as fairness and the protection of the purchaser from deceit, outweigh the negative effects (E-) in that case. 

Applying this rule to our current case, Rufus has a potential claim against Lillabeth on the grounds of misrepresentation. Lillabeth's failure to disclose the artists' relocation and the impact of the bypass on the business turnover are material facts that Rufus relied upon in deciding to purchase the café. Therefore, Rufus should be entitled to rescind the contract and seek the return of any deposits paid.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA008564/1998 BETWEEN GREEN PARK PROPERTIES LIMITED Plaintiff AND DORKU LIMITED Defendant) are present:

- **Misrepresentation by Conduct**: In HCA008564/1998, the defendant's conduct in showing the property without disclosing that the yard was not included constituted misrepresentation. Similarly, in our current case, Lillabeth's conduct in showing the café and providing turnover figures without disclosing the artists' relocation and the bypass constitutes misrepresentation.
  
- **Duty to Disclose Material Facts**: In HCA008564/1998, the defendant had a duty to disclose that the yard was not part of the property. In our current case, Lillabeth had a duty to disclose the artists' relocation and the impact of the bypass on the business, as these are material facts that would influence Rufus's decision to purchase the café.
  
- **Reliance on Misrepresentation**: In HCA008564/1998, the plaintiff relied on the misrepresentation in deciding to purchase the property. In our current case, Rufus relied on Lillabeth's representations about the turnover and the artists' presence in deciding to purchase the café.
  
- **Rescission of Contract**: In HCA008564/1998, the court allowed the plaintiff to rescind the contract due to misrepresentation. In our current case, Rufus seeks to rescind the contract based on similar grounds of misrepresentation.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome, which is to allow Rufus to rescind the contract. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA008564/1998, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Fairness**: Allowing Rufus to rescind the contract would uphold the principle of fairness by protecting him from being misled by material misrepresentations.
2. **Protection of Purchasers**: It would reinforce the legal protection afforded to purchasers, ensuring that they are not deceived by sellers who fail to disclose material facts.
3. **Encouragement of Good Faith in Transactions**: This outcome would encourage sellers to act in good faith and disclose all material facts, thereby promoting transparency and trust in commercial transactions.
4. **Deterrence of Misrepresentation**: By ruling in favor of Rufus, the court would deter future misrepresentations by sellers, contributing to a more honest and reliable market environment.

Therefore, based on the shared fact patterns and the positive effects on the underlying values and principles of the law, the court should allow Rufus to rescind the contract and seek the return of any deposits paid.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA008564/1998 BETWEEN GREEN PARK PROPERTIES LIMITED Plaintiff AND DORKU LIMITED Defendant, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the misrepresentation involved a physical aspect of the property (the yard) that was directly observable during the inspection. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as upholding fairness and protecting the purchaser from deceit, outweighed any potential drawbacks because the misrepresentation was about a tangible and visible part of the property that the purchaser was led to believe was included in the sale.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of a physical misrepresentation is notably absent. The misrepresentation in Rufus's case involves financial figures and the presence of artists, which are not directly observable physical aspects of the property. Instead, they are more abstract and require reliance on the seller's statements and documentation. This difference means that the misrepresentation in Rufus's case is less about a visible, tangible aspect of the property and more about the business's financial and operational conditions.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in HCA008564/1998 BETWEEN GREEN PARK PROPERTIES LIMITED Plaintiff AND DORKU LIMITED Defendant: the impact of an external change (the construction of a bypass) on the business's turnover. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces an element of external economic influence that was not present in the precedent case.

Due to the construction of the bypass, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as unfairly holding the seller responsible for external economic changes that are beyond their control. Unlike in HCA008564/1998, where the misrepresentation was about a static, physical aspect of the property, the current case involves dynamic economic conditions that can fluctuate due to external factors. This distinction means that the court should consider the external economic impact separately from the seller's misrepresentation about the business's turnover and the presence of artists.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA008564/1998 BETWEEN GREEN PARK PROPERTIES LIMITED Plaintiff AND DORKU LIMITED Defendant should be stated as: "When both [misrepresentation by conduct and failure to disclose material facts] and [the misrepresentation involves a physical aspect of the property] are present, the court should decide [to allow rescission of the contract]." Omitting [the misrepresentation involves a physical aspect of the property] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q], which is unfairly holding sellers responsible for external economic changes that are beyond their control. Indeed, the opinion in HCA008564/1998 explicitly states that the misrepresentation was about a tangible and visible part of the property, which was crucial to their decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA008564/1998 was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of purchasers being misled about the physical boundaries and features of a property]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [purchasers being misled about the physical boundaries and features of a property] occurring. Instead, the misrepresentation involves financial figures and the presence of artists, which are not directly observable physical aspects of the property. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of a physical misrepresentation, which was present in the precedent case HCA008564/1998 BETWEEN GREEN PARK PROPERTIES LIMITED Plaintiff AND DORKU LIMITED Defendant, requiring this factor for all similar cases of misrepresentation by conduct and failure to disclose material facts would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would unfairly limit the scope of protection for purchasers to only those cases involving physical aspects of a property, thereby excluding cases where misrepresentation involves financial or operational conditions that are equally material to the purchaser's decision. Conversely, not requiring the physical misrepresentation factor would allow for a broader application of the principle of fairness and protection against deceit, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area. This approach ensures that all material misrepresentations, whether physical or financial, are addressed, thereby promoting transparency and trust in commercial transactions.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of a physical misrepresentation, which was present in HCA008564/1998 BETWEEN GREEN PARK PROPERTIES LIMITED Plaintiff AND DORKU LIMITED Defendant, we have the additional factor of an external economic change (the construction of a bypass). This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of misrepresentation by conduct and failure to disclose material facts, serves a similar function to the physical misrepresentation in the precedent case. Given the presence of this external economic change, we submit that the reasoning in HCA008564/1998 still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as fairness and the protection of purchasers from deceit, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences. This approach ensures that purchasers are protected from all forms of material misrepresentation, whether they involve physical aspects of the property or external economic conditions, thereby upholding the principles of fairness and transparency in commercial transactions.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA008564/1998 BETWEEN GREEN PARK PROPERTIES LIMITED Plaintiff AND DORKU LIMITED Defendant, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as misrepresentation by conduct and failure to disclose material facts. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of a physical misrepresentation and the presence of an external economic change (the construction of a bypass).

The proposed legal rule of allowing rescission of the contract when there is misrepresentation by conduct and failure to disclose material facts finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the differences between the cases.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that misrepresentation involving financial figures and the presence of artists, although not physical, is still material to the purchaser's decision. Conversely, the argument that external economic changes should not unfairly hold sellers responsible is also compelling.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, protection of purchasers, and the encouragement of good faith in transactions, we conclude that Rufus has a potential claim against Lillabeth on the grounds of misrepresentation. The failure to disclose the artists' relocation and the impact of the bypass on the business turnover are material facts that Rufus relied upon in deciding to purchase the café. Therefore, Rufus should be entitled to rescind the contract and seek the return of any deposits paid.

This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by ensuring that all forms of material misrepresentation, whether they involve physical aspects of the property or external economic conditions, are addressed. This approach upholds the principles of fairness and transparency in commercial transactions.

   - The misrepresentation was not made to him fraudulently
   - He would be entitled, by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract
   - It is claimed in any proceedings arising out of the contract that the contract ought to be or has been rescinded
   - The court or arbitrator is of opinion that it would be equitable to do so, having regard to:
     * The nature of the misrepresentation
     * The loss that would be caused by it if the contract were upheld
     * The loss that rescission would cause to the other party

   Consequences:
   - The court or arbitrator may declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1:
- Rufus has entered into a contract with Lillabeth after a misrepresentation.
- The misrepresentation was made to him by Lillabeth.
- Rufus has suffered loss as a result of the misrepresentation, as the turnover was significantly less than represented.
- If Lillabeth had made the misrepresentation fraudulently, she would have been liable to damages.
- Lillabeth may not have reasonable grounds to believe her claim is true, as the turnover figures were significantly inflated and the artists had moved out.
- Therefore, this section applies, and Lillabeth is liable to damages.

2. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2:
- Rufus has entered into a contract to purchase the café.
- Lillabeth's claim about the turnover and income sources is a misrepresentation.
- Rufus entered into the contract after this misrepresentation was made to him.
- Lillabeth did not make this misrepresentation fraudulently.
- Rufus would be entitled, by reason of misrepresentation, to rescind the contract.
- Rufus may claim in proceedings that the contract ought to be rescinded.
- Balancing the nature of the misrepresentation,
  * it is a material misrepresentation affecting the value of the business;
  * the loss that would be suffered by Rufus if the contract was upheld is substantial due to the lower turnover and bypass affecting trade;
  * the loss to Lillabeth if rescission were granted would be the return of the café.
- Therefore, this section applies, and the court may declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission.

### Conclusion:

Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1 and 2 apply. Lillabeth is liable to damages for the misrepresentation, and the court may declare the contract subsisting and award Rufus damages in lieu of rescission.

- Lillabeth made a statement regarding the turnover and income sources of the café, claiming £65,000 from café sales, £30,000 from art sales, and £5,000 from rentals.
- This statement was false, as the total turnover of the business had never been more than £50,000.
- Rufus was induced to act upon this statement by deciding to purchase the café based on the provided figures.
- The statement was made negligently as Lillabeth did not verify the accuracy of the figures and did not disclose the artists' relocation to the village hall.
- Rufus relied on the statement, as he chose not to inspect the account books due to their condition and took Lillabeth's word for it.

### Conclusion:

DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited v Sit Pan Jit applies, and Lillabeth may be liable for misrepresentation as her statement regarding the turnover and income sources was false, misleading, and made negligently, and Rufus relied on this statement in deciding to purchase the café.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited)
In the case of Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited (precedent p), the court ruled that the defendants were not liable for fraudulent misrepresentation. The court found that there was no intent to defraud, and the representations made were not wilfully false or made in the absence of any genuine belief in their truth. The court also noted that the misrepresentations were not made recklessly or without care for their truth.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Misrepresentation**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, there were representations made about the financial status of a business. In the precedent case, representations were made about the financial position of WMI. In the current case, representations were made about the turnover and income sources of the Artists’ Refuge Café.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Knowledge of Falsity**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In both cases, the issue of whether the representations were made with knowledge of their falsity or recklessly without care for their truth was central. In the precedent case, the court found no knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth. In the current case, Rufus was misled about the turnover and income sources, and the bypass affecting the business was not disclosed.
  
- **Legal Concept 3: Reliance on Representation**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In both cases, the plaintiffs relied on the representations made by the defendants. In the precedent case, ADS relied on the financial representations to continue trading. In the current case, Rufus relied on the turnover and income representations to decide to purchase the café.
  
- **Legal Concept 4: Damages**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In both cases, the plaintiffs suffered damages as a result of relying on the misrepresentations. In the precedent case, ADS suffered financial losses. In the current case, Rufus faces a business with significantly lower turnover than represented.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of misrepresentation (i*), the court should decide that the misrepresentation must be made with knowledge of its falsity or recklessly without care for its truth to establish liability (outcome o). This rule was justified in Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited because the positive effects (E+) of requiring a high threshold for proving fraudulent misrepresentation (i.e., knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard) on the underlying values and principles of the law, such as fairness and preventing frivolous claims, outweigh the negative effects (E-) in that case. 

In the current case, Rufus may have a potential claim for misrepresentation against Lillabeth if he can establish that the representations about the turnover and income sources were made with knowledge of their falsity or recklessly without care for their truth. Additionally, the non-disclosure of the bypass and its impact on the business could further support his claim.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Misrepresentation**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, there were representations made about the financial status of a business. In the precedent case, representations were made about the financial position of WMI. In the current case, representations were made about the turnover and income sources of the Artists’ Refuge Café.

- **Legal Concept 2: Knowledge of Falsity**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In both cases, the issue of whether the representations were made with knowledge of their falsity or recklessly without care for their truth was central. In the precedent case, the court found no knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth. In the current case, Rufus was misled about the turnover and income sources, and the bypass affecting the business was not disclosed.

- **Legal Concept 3: Reliance on Representation**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In both cases, the plaintiffs relied on the representations made by the defendants. In the precedent case, ADS relied on the financial representations to continue trading. In the current case, Rufus relied on the turnover and income representations to decide to purchase the café.

- **Legal Concept 4: Damages**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In both cases, the plaintiffs suffered damages as a result of relying on the misrepresentations. In the precedent case, ADS suffered financial losses. In the current case, Rufus faces a business with significantly lower turnover than represented.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Fairness and Justice**: Ensuring that parties who make representations about the financial status of a business are held accountable if those representations are made with knowledge of their falsity or recklessly without care for their truth promotes fairness and justice. It prevents parties from benefiting from deceitful practices.

2. **Deterrence**: Upholding a high threshold for proving fraudulent misrepresentation (i.e., knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard) deters parties from making false statements recklessly. It encourages due diligence and honesty in business transactions.

3. **Reliability in Business Transactions**: By holding parties accountable for fraudulent misrepresentations, the court reinforces the reliability and trustworthiness of business transactions. This is crucial for maintaining confidence in the market.

4. **Protection of Innocent Parties**: Ensuring that innocent parties who rely on representations and suffer damages as a result are provided with a remedy aligns with the principles of equity and justice. It protects individuals like Rufus from being misled and suffering financial harm.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited, it would have the positive effects of promoting fairness, deterring fraudulent behavior, ensuring reliability in business transactions, and protecting innocent parties.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the non-disclosure of the bypass construction, that was not present in Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of misrepresentation because it introduces an additional element of non-disclosure that directly impacts the business's viability and attractiveness to potential buyers.

Due to the non-disclosure of the bypass construction, applying the same outcome (i.e., no liability for misrepresentation) in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the trust in business transactions and potentially allowing sellers to omit critical information that could affect the buyer's decision. Unlike in Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited, where the court found no intent to defraud or reckless disregard for the truth, the non-disclosure of the bypass in our current case suggests a deliberate omission of material information that Rufus would have reasonably relied upon in making his decision to purchase the café. This omission could be seen as a form of misrepresentation by silence, which significantly impacts the fairness and transparency of the transaction.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited should be stated as: "When both [misrepresentation] and [non-disclosure of material information] are present, the court should decide [liability for misrepresentation]." Omitting [non-disclosure of material information] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q], which is the undermining of trust in business transactions and allowing sellers to omit critical information that could affect the buyer's decision. Indeed, the opinion in Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited explicitly states that the absence of intent to defraud or reckless disregard for the truth was crucial to their decision. Including non-disclosure of material information as a factor ensures that sellers are held accountable for omissions that significantly impact the transaction's fairness and transparency.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of frivolous claims and to ensure that only representations made with knowledge of their falsity or reckless disregard for their truth would lead to liability. However, in our current case, there's no risk of frivolous claims because the non-disclosure of the bypass construction is a significant omission that directly impacts the business's viability and attractiveness to potential buyers. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The non-disclosure of the bypass construction introduces a new element of material omission that warrants a different consideration for liability.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the explicit finding of no intent to defraud or reckless disregard for the truth, which was present in the precedent case Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited, requiring this factor for all similar cases of misrepresentation would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would allow sellers to omit critical information that could significantly impact the buyer's decision, thereby undermining trust in business transactions. Conversely, not requiring the explicit finding of no intent to defraud or reckless disregard for the truth would allow for a more comprehensive assessment of the seller's conduct, including omissions of material information, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and transparency in contract law. This approach ensures that parties are held accountable for both active misrepresentations and significant omissions that affect the transaction's fairness.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the explicit finding of no intent to defraud or reckless disregard for the truth, which was present in Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited, we have the additional factor of non-disclosure of material information (the bypass construction). This non-disclosure, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of misrepresentation about the financial status of the business, serves a similar function to the explicit finding of no intent to defraud in the precedent case. Given the presence of this non-disclosure, we submit that the reasoning in Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited still applies, as the positive effects on fairness, transparency, and trust in business transactions would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. This ensures that sellers are held accountable for omissions that significantly impact the transaction's fairness and transparency, thereby protecting innocent parties like Rufus from being misled and suffering financial harm.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v. Wheelock Marden & Company Limited, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of misrepresentation about the financial status of a business, reliance on those representations by the plaintiff, and the resulting damages. However, it also differs significantly in the non-disclosure of material information (the bypass construction) that directly impacts the business's viability and attractiveness to potential buyers.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case, which requires knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth to establish liability for misrepresentation, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the additional factor of non-disclosure in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the non-disclosure of the bypass construction introduces an element of material omission that significantly impacts the fairness and transparency of the transaction. This omission could be seen as a form of misrepresentation by silence, which was not present in the precedent case.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, transparency, and trust in business transactions, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Rufus has a potential claim against Lillabeth on the grounds of misrepresentation. The non-disclosure of the bypass construction, combined with the false representations about the turnover and income sources, constitutes a significant omission that Rufus reasonably relied upon in making his decision to purchase the café. This aligns with the principles of equity and justice, ensuring that parties are held accountable for both active misrepresentations and significant omissions that affect the transaction's fairness.

Therefore, we find that Lillabeth's actions amount to misrepresentation, and Rufus is entitled to seek remedies for the damages suffered as a result of relying on those misrepresentations. This decision serves justice and legal consistency by holding parties accountable for omissions that significantly impact the transaction's fairness and transparency.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA003799/1997 BETWEEN LEE LI and FUNG SEK HANG Plaintiffs AND CHEUNG CHI KEUNG 1st Defendant YIP WING LING 2nd Defendant LIN KAM TAI 3rd Defendant)
In the case of HCA003799/1997 BETWEEN LEE LI and FUNG SEK HANG Plaintiffs AND CHEUNG CHI KEUNG 1st Defendant YIP WING LING 2nd Defendant LIN KAM TAI 3rd Defendant (precedent p), the plaintiffs (Purchasers) claimed that they were misled by the defendants (Vendors) regarding the size and legality of certain structures of a property they intended to purchase. The court ruled that the plaintiffs failed to prove the misrepresentation and reliance on the alleged misrepresentation. The court also found that the plaintiffs had affirmed the contract after discovering the facts, thus precluding them from rescinding the contract. The outcome (o) was that the plaintiffs' claims were dismissed.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA003799/1997 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Misrepresentation**: In both cases, the plaintiffs allege that they were misled by false statements made by the defendants.
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA003799/1997, the plaintiffs claimed they were misled about the size and legality of the property. In our current case, Rufus claims he was misled about the turnover and the status of the artists.
- **Reliance on Representation**: The plaintiffs in both cases claim they relied on the defendants' statements when entering into the contract.
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA003799/1997, the plaintiffs claimed they relied on the vendor's statements about the property size. In our current case, Rufus relied on Lillabeth's statements about the turnover and the artists.
- **Inspection Opportunity**: In both cases, the plaintiffs had an opportunity to inspect the relevant documents or property but chose not to do so.
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA003799/1997, the plaintiffs inspected the property multiple times but did not verify the statements. In our current case, Rufus had the opportunity to inspect the account books but chose not to.
- **Affirmation of Contract**: In both cases, the plaintiffs took actions that could be seen as affirming the contract after discovering the alleged misrepresentation.
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCA003799/1997, the plaintiffs continued with the contract after discovering the facts. In our current case, Rufus signed the contract despite the opportunity to verify the turnover.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA003799/1997)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of alleged misrepresentation, reliance on the representation, opportunity to inspect, and actions affirming the contract, the court should decide that the plaintiffs' claims for misrepresentation fail. This rule was justified in HCA003799/1997 because the plaintiffs had ample opportunity to verify the facts and chose to proceed with the contract, thus affirming it. The positive effects (E+) of this outcome include upholding the principle of caveat emptor (buyer beware) and ensuring that parties take responsibility for their due diligence. The negative effects (E-) are minimal as the plaintiffs had the opportunity to verify the facts but chose not to, thus their reliance on the misrepresentation is questionable.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA003799/1997 BETWEEN LEE LI and FUNG SEK HANG Plaintiffs AND CHEUNG CHI KEUNG 1st Defendant YIP WING LING 2nd Defendant LIN KAM TAI 3rd Defendant) are present:

- **Misrepresentation**: In both cases, the plaintiffs allege that they were misled by false statements made by the defendants.
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA003799/1997, the plaintiffs claimed they were misled about the size and legality of the property. In our current case, Rufus claims he was misled about the turnover and the status of the artists.

- **Reliance on Representation**: The plaintiffs in both cases claim they relied on the defendants' statements when entering into the contract.
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA003799/1997, the plaintiffs claimed they relied on the vendor's statements about the property size. In our current case, Rufus relied on Lillabeth's statements about the turnover and the artists.

- **Inspection Opportunity**: In both cases, the plaintiffs had an opportunity to inspect the relevant documents or property but chose not to do so.
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA003799/1997, the plaintiffs inspected the property multiple times but did not verify the statements. In our current case, Rufus had the opportunity to inspect the account books but chose not to.

- **Affirmation of Contract**: In both cases, the plaintiffs took actions that could be seen as affirming the contract after discovering the alleged misrepresentation.
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCA003799/1997, the plaintiffs continued with the contract after discovering the facts. In our current case, Rufus signed the contract despite the opportunity to verify the turnover.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCA003799/1997, which is the dismissal of the plaintiffs' claims. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA003799/1997, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding the Principle of Caveat Emptor (Buyer Beware)**: This principle is fundamental in contract law, especially in transactions involving property or business sales. It ensures that buyers take responsibility for their due diligence before entering into a contract. By dismissing Rufus's claim, the court would reinforce the importance of this principle, encouraging buyers to thoroughly inspect and verify the information provided by sellers.

2. **Encouraging Due Diligence**: The decision would emphasize the necessity for buyers to take advantage of opportunities to inspect and verify relevant information. Rufus had the chance to inspect the account books but chose not to, similar to the plaintiffs in the precedent case who had multiple opportunities to inspect the property. This encourages a more cautious and informed approach to transactions.

3. **Preventing Unjust Enrichment**: Allowing Rufus to rescind the contract based on alleged misrepresentation, despite having the opportunity to verify the facts, could lead to unjust enrichment. Sellers should not be penalized for buyers' failure to exercise due diligence. This decision would ensure that both parties are held accountable for their actions and decisions.

4. **Legal Consistency and Predictability**: Applying the same legal rule to similar fact patterns ensures consistency and predictability in the law. This is crucial for maintaining public confidence in the legal system. By following the precedent set in HCA003799/1997, the court would provide a clear and consistent application of the law regarding misrepresentation and reliance.

In conclusion, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns as the precedent case, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome, which is the dismissal of Rufus's claims. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA003799/1997, it would uphold the principle of caveat emptor, encourage due diligence, prevent unjust enrichment, and ensure legal consistency and predictability.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA003799/1997 BETWEEN LEE LI and FUNG SEK HANG Plaintiffs AND CHEUNG CHI KEUNG 1st Defendant YIP WING LING 2nd Defendant LIN KAM TAI 3rd Defendant, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the plaintiffs' multiple inspections of the property and their subsequent actions that affirmed the contract. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—upholding the principle of caveat emptor and encouraging due diligence—outweighed any potential drawbacks because the plaintiffs had ample opportunity to verify the facts and chose to proceed with the contract, thus affirming it. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of multiple inspections and subsequent actions affirming the contract is notably absent. Rufus only visited the café once and did not take any subsequent actions that could be seen as affirming the contract after discovering the alleged misrepresentation. This absence weakens the argument that Rufus had ample opportunity to verify the facts and chose to proceed with the contract.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in HCA003799/1997 BETWEEN LEE LI and FUNG SEK HANG Plaintiffs AND CHEUNG CHI KEUNG 1st Defendant YIP WING LING 2nd Defendant LIN KAM TAI 3rd Defendant. This factor is the significant change in circumstances due to the construction of the bypass around Little Butte, which caused a substantial fall in the amount of passing trade. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces an external change that directly impacts the business's turnover and Rufus's decision to purchase the café. Due to this factor, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as unfairly penalizing Rufus for an external change that he could not have anticipated, unlike in HCA003799/1997 where the plaintiffs had control over their decision to inspect the property. This external change significantly impacts the viability of the business and Rufus's reliance on the turnover figures provided by Lillabeth, making the case for misrepresentation stronger.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA003799/1997 BETWEEN LEE LI and FUNG SEK HANG Plaintiffs AND CHEUNG CHI KEUNG 1st Defendant YIP WING LING 2nd Defendant LIN KAM TAI 3rd Defendant should be stated as: "When both [i*] (alleged misrepresentation, reliance on the representation, opportunity to inspect, and actions affirming the contract) and [m] (multiple inspections and subsequent actions affirming the contract) are present, the court should decide [o] (dismissal of the plaintiffs' claims)." Omitting [m] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q] (unfairly penalizing buyers who did not have multiple opportunities to inspect or did not take actions affirming the contract after discovering the alleged misrepresentation). Indeed, the opinion in HCA003799/1997 explicitly states that the plaintiffs' multiple inspections and subsequent actions affirming the contract were crucial to their decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA003799/1997 was clearly designed to prevent [undesirable consequence u] (buyers claiming misrepresentation despite having ample opportunity to verify facts and affirming the contract). However, in our current case, there's no risk of [u] occurring because Rufus did not have multiple opportunities to inspect the account books and did not take any subsequent actions that could be seen as affirming the contract after discovering the alleged misrepresentation. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of multiple inspections and subsequent actions affirming the contract (factor m), which was present in the precedent case HCA003799/1997 BETWEEN LEE LI and FUNG SEK HANG Plaintiffs AND CHEUNG CHI KEUNG 1st Defendant YIP WING LING 2nd Defendant LIN KAM TAI 3rd Defendant, requiring this factor for all similar cases of alleged misrepresentation, reliance on the representation, opportunity to inspect, and actions affirming the contract (fact pattern i*) would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would unfairly penalize buyers who did not have multiple opportunities to inspect or did not take actions affirming the contract after discovering the alleged misrepresentation. Conversely, not requiring factor m would allow for a more equitable outcome, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, such as ensuring fairness and preventing unjust enrichment. This approach would recognize that a single inspection and reliance on the seller's representations can still constitute a valid basis for a misrepresentation claim, especially when external changes, like the construction of a bypass, significantly impact the transaction.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of multiple inspections and subsequent actions affirming the contract (factor m), which was present in HCA003799/1997, we have the additional factor of a significant external change (factor n), namely the construction of a bypass around Little Butte, which was absent in the precedent case. This factor n, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of alleged misrepresentation, reliance on the representation, and opportunity to inspect (fact pattern i*), serves a similar function to factor m in the precedent case. Given the presence of factor n, we submit that the reasoning in HCA003799/1997 still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as ensuring fairness and preventing unjust enrichment, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. The significant external change directly impacts the business's turnover and Rufus's reliance on the turnover figures provided by Lillabeth, making the case for misrepresentation stronger and justifying a different outcome.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA003799/1997 BETWEEN LEE LI and FUNG SEK HANG Plaintiffs AND CHEUNG CHI KEUNG 1st Defendant YIP WING LING 2nd Defendant LIN KAM TAI 3rd Defendant, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations.

The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in the areas of alleged misrepresentation, reliance on the representation, opportunity to inspect, and actions affirming the contract. Both cases involve plaintiffs who claim they were misled by false statements made by the defendants and had opportunities to verify the information but chose not to do so.

However, the current case differs significantly in two key aspects:
1. **Lack of Multiple Inspections and Affirmation**: Unlike the plaintiffs in the precedent case, Rufus did not have multiple opportunities to inspect the account books and did not take any subsequent actions that could be seen as affirming the contract after discovering the alleged misrepresentation.
2. **Significant External Change**: The construction of the bypass around Little Butte, which caused a substantial fall in the amount of passing trade, introduces an external change that directly impacts the business's turnover and Rufus's reliance on the turnover figures provided by Lillabeth.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case, which emphasizes the importance of multiple inspections and subsequent actions affirming the contract, finds support in both cases but must be applied with caution. The broader implications of strictly requiring these factors could lead to unfair outcomes in cases where buyers did not have multiple opportunities to inspect or did not take actions affirming the contract after discovering the alleged misrepresentation.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of upholding the principle of caveat emptor and encouraging due diligence (as argued in the initial analogy) against the need to ensure fairness and prevent unjust enrichment (as argued in the rebuttal and surrebuttal).

Considering the underlying legal principles of ensuring fairness, preventing unjust enrichment, and maintaining legal consistency, we conclude that Rufus has a potential claim against Lillabeth on the grounds of misrepresentation. The significant external change (construction of the bypass) and the lack of multiple inspections and subsequent actions affirming the contract distinguish this case from the precedent and justify a different outcome.

Therefore, Rufus's claim should not be dismissed outright. Instead, the court should consider the specific circumstances of this case, including the impact of the bypass and Rufus's reliance on Lillabeth's representations, to determine whether misrepresentation occurred and whether Rufus is entitled to rescind the contract and seek damages.

This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by recognizing the unique factors present in this case.
