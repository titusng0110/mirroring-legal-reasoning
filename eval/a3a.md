# Contract Law: Whether there is a mistake as to the quality of the stained glass panel

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Sections 15, 16, and 17

### Major Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 15 Subsection 1

   Conditions:
   - There is a contract for the sale of goods by description.
   - The goods do not correspond with the description.

   Consequences:
   - There is an implied condition that the goods shall correspond with the description.

   Exceptions:
   - The sale is by sample as well as by description, and the bulk of the goods corresponds with the sample but not with the description.

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 16 Subsection 3

   Conditions:
   - There is a contract for the sale of goods.
   - The seller sells goods in the course of a business.
   - The buyer, expressly or by implication, makes known to the seller any particular purpose for which the goods are being bought.

   Consequences:
   - There is an implied condition that the goods supplied under the contract are reasonably fit for that purpose.

   Exceptions:
   - The circumstances show that the buyer does not rely, or that it is unreasonable for him to rely, on the seller's skill or judgment.

3. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 16 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - There is a contract for the sale of goods.
   - The seller sells goods in the course of a business.

   Consequences:
   - There is an implied condition that the goods supplied under the contract are of merchantable quality.

   Exceptions:
   - Defects are specifically drawn to the buyer's attention before the contract is made.
   - The buyer examines the goods before the contract is made, as regards defects which that examination ought to reveal.
   - The contract is a contract for sale by sample, as regards defects which would have been apparent on a reasonable examination of the sample.

4. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 17 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - There is a contract for the sale of goods.
   - The sale is by sample.

   Consequences:
   - There is an implied condition that the bulk shall correspond with the sample in quality.
   - The buyer shall have a reasonable opportunity of comparing the bulk with the sample.
   - The goods shall be free from any defect, rendering them unmerchantable, which would not be apparent on reasonable examination of the sample.

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 15 Subsection 1:
   - There is a contract for the sale of goods by description (the stained glass panel depicting a dragon).
   - The goods (stained glass panel) do not correspond with the description (it is not an original work by Clarky but a piece done by his evening beginner class students).

   Therefore, there is an implied condition that the goods shall correspond with the description. The exception does not apply as the sale was not by sample.

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 16 Subsection 3:
   - There is a contract for the sale of goods (the stained glass panel).
   - The seller (Felicity) sells goods in the course of a business (this condition is not satisfied as Felicity is not selling in the course of a business but as an individual inheriting her father's works).
   
   Therefore, this section does not apply.

3. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 16 Subsection 2:
   - There is a contract for the sale of goods (the stained glass panel).
   - The seller (Felicity) does not sell goods in the course of a business (this condition is not satisfied as Felicity is not selling in the course of a business but as an individual inheriting her father's works).

   Therefore, this section does not apply.

4. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 17 Subsection 2:
   - There is a contract for the sale of goods (the stained glass panel).
   - The sale is not by sample (this condition is not satisfied as the sale was by description).

   Therefore, this section does not apply.

### Conclusion:

Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 15 Subsection 1 applies, and there is an implied condition that the goods shall correspond with the description. Since the stained glass panel does not correspond with the description (it is not an original work by Clarky), Reah is entitled to rescind the contract.

### Relevant law:

Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited

### Major Premise:

1. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited

   Conditions:
   - There is a mutual or common mistake about whether a written document correctly reflects what the parties had, on an objective assessment, agreed it should contain; or
   - There is a unilateral mistake where one party knows that the other party thinks a term is included or has a mistaken belief about the meaning of a term, and the other party is aware of this mistake.

   Consequences:
   - The court may rectify the document to reflect the true agreement of the parties; or
   - The court may refuse to allow the mistaken party to enforce the contract as it would ordinarily be construed, or rectify the written agreement to give effect to what the mistaken party thought had been agreed.

   Exceptions:
   - The court cannot predicate with certainty what the contract was, and that it is, by common mistake, wrongly expressed in the document; or
   - The mistake is not about whether the document correctly reflects the terms previously agreed, but about the mistaken belief of one of the parties, known to the other, about what the contract said or meant.

2. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited

   Conditions:
   - There is a mutual or common mistake about whether a written document correctly reflects what the parties had, on an objective assessment, agreed it should contain; or
   - There is a unilateral mistake where one party knows that the other party thinks a term is included or has a mistaken belief about its meaning, and the first party does not correct this mistake.

   Consequences:
   - The court may rectify the document to reflect the true agreement of the parties.

   Exceptions:
   - The court cannot predicate with certainty what the original agreement was; or
   - The mistake does not concern the terms previously agreed but rather the mistaken belief of one party, unknown to the other.

3. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited

   Conditions:
   - There is a common mistake about whether a written document correctly reflects what the parties had, on an objective assessment, agreed it should contain; and
   - The mistake is about whether the document correctly reflects the terms previously agreed.

   Consequences:
   - The court can rectify the document to reflect the true agreement of the parties.

   Exceptions:
   - The court cannot predicate with certainty what the contract was, and that it is, by common mistake, wrongly expressed in the document.

### Minor Premise:

1. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited:
   - There is a mutual mistake about the quality of the stained glass panel.
   - Both Felicity and Reah believed the panel to be an original work by Clarky, but it was actually a piece created by Clarky's evening beginner class students.
   - The mistake concerns the quality and value of the panel, not the terms of the contract itself.
   - The court cannot rectify the document to reflect the true agreement of the parties because the mistake is about the quality of the item, not the terms of the contract.

2. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited:
   - There is a mutual mistake about the quality of the stained glass panel.
   - Both parties believed the panel to be an original work by Clarky.
   - The mistake concerns the quality and value of the panel, not the terms of the contract itself.
   - The court cannot rectify the document to reflect the true agreement of the parties because the mistake is about the quality of the item, not the terms of the contract.

3. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited:
   - There is a common mistake about the quality of the stained glass panel.
   - Both parties believed the panel to be an original work by Clarky.
   - The mistake concerns the quality and value of the panel, not the terms of the contract itself.
   - The court cannot rectify the document to reflect the true agreement of the parties because the mistake is about the quality of the item, not the terms of the contract.

### Conclusion:

The doctrine of mistake does not apply to the scenario because the mistake is about the quality and value of the stained glass panel, not about whether the written document correctly reflects the terms previously agreed. Therefore, Reah must proceed with the contract as agreed.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCMP 180/2005)
In the case of HCMP 180/2005 BETWEEN TONY INVESTMENTS LIMITED (德隆投資有限公司) Plaintiff and FUNG SUN KWAN BERNARD(馮燊均) (alias FUNG SUN KWAN) trading as KWONG YEE WOO (SHIPBUILDING CONTRACTORS) Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the Vendor had no title to the Former Slipway and that the Purchaser's requisitions were reasonable. The Vendor failed to show good title, and the Purchaser was entitled to specific performance or damages. The court also rejected the Vendor's defence of common mistake, holding that the mistake did not render the contract void as the Vendor had a contractual right to seek a re-grant from the Government.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCMP 180/2005 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Mistake as to Quality of Subject Matter**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Vendor believed he had title to the Former Slipway, but it was later found that he did not. In our current case, Reah believed she was purchasing an original work by Clarky, but it was later found to be a piece created by beginner students.

- **Legal Concept 2: Implied Warranty of Title**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Vendor implicitly warranted that he had good title to the property. In our current case, Felicity implicitly warranted that the stained glass panel was an original work by Clarky.

- **Legal Concept 3: Specific Performance and Damages**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Purchaser sought specific performance or damages due to the Vendor's failure to show good title. In our current case, Reah seeks to avoid the contract or seek damages due to the misapprehension about the quality of the stained glass panel.

- **Legal Concept 4: Common Mistake**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Vendor argued that there was a common mistake regarding the title to the Former Slipway. In our current case, Reah argues that there was a common mistake regarding the quality and origin of the stained glass panel.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCMP 180/2005)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a common mistake as to the quality of the subject matter (fact pattern i*), the court should decide that the contract is not void but may allow for remedies such as specific performance or damages (outcome o). This rule was justified in HCMP 180/2005 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that parties cannot easily void contracts based on mistaken assumptions about quality outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially enforcing contracts that are not as beneficial as initially thought. This approach upholds the principles of contractual certainty and the implied warranty of title, ensuring that parties are held to their agreements unless the mistake fundamentally alters the nature of the contract.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCMP 180/2005) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Mistake as to Quality of Subject Matter**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Vendor believed he had title to the Former Slipway, but it was later found that he did not. In our current case, Reah believed she was purchasing an original work by Clarky, but it was later found to be a piece created by beginner students.

- **Legal Concept 2: Implied Warranty of Title**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Vendor implicitly warranted that he had good title to the property. In our current case, Felicity implicitly warranted that the stained glass panel was an original work by Clarky.

- **Legal Concept 3: Specific Performance and Damages**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Purchaser sought specific performance or damages due to the Vendor's failure to show good title. In our current case, Reah seeks to avoid the contract or seek damages due to the misapprehension about the quality of the stained glass panel.

- **Legal Concept 4: Common Mistake**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Vendor argued that there was a common mistake regarding the title to the Former Slipway. In our current case, Reah argues that there was a common mistake regarding the quality and origin of the stained glass panel.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCMP 180/2005. This decision would be justified because, as in HCMP 180/2005, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Contractual Certainty**: Ensuring that parties cannot easily void contracts based on mistaken assumptions about the quality of the subject matter upholds the principle of contractual certainty. This encourages parties to conduct due diligence before entering into agreements.

2. **Implied Warranty of Title**: By holding Felicity to the implied warranty that the stained glass panel was an original work by Clarky, the court reinforces the expectation that sellers must ensure they have good title and accurate descriptions of what they are selling.

3. **Equitable Remedies**: Allowing for remedies such as specific performance or damages ensures that the aggrieved party, in this case, Reah, is not left without recourse. This aligns with the equitable principles that guide the court in providing fair outcomes.

4. **Preventing Unjust Enrichment**: By not allowing Felicity to benefit from the sale of a misrepresented item, the court prevents unjust enrichment and ensures that the seller does not profit from a mistake that significantly affects the value of the subject matter.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCMP 180/2005, it would uphold the principles of contractual certainty, implied warranty of title, equitable remedies, and prevent unjust enrichment.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCMP 180/2005, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the Vendor had a contractual right to seek a re-grant from the Government. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling (upholding contractual certainty and implied warranty of title) outweighed any potential drawbacks (enforcing a contract with a mistaken assumption about title) because the Vendor had a clear and actionable path to rectify the title issue by obtaining the re-grant. However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as Felicity does not have any similar contractual right or mechanism to rectify the misapprehension about the stained glass panel's origin and quality. There is no equivalent process that Felicity can undertake to transform the student-created piece into an original work by Clarky.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in HCMP 180/2005: the significant disparity in the value of the subject matter due to the mistake. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the difference between £50,000 and £5,000 is substantial and fundamentally changes the nature of the contract. Due to this significant disparity in value, applying the same outcome (enforcing the contract) in our case would have more negative consequences, such as causing severe financial loss to Reah and undermining the fairness and equity principles in contract law, than positive ones. Unlike in HCMP 180/2005, where the Vendor had a clear path to rectify the title issue, there is no such rectification possible in our current case, making the mistake about the quality and origin of the stained glass panel much more impactful and justifying a different outcome.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCMP 180/2005 should be stated as "When both a common mistake as to the quality of the subject matter (i*) and the absence of a contractual right to rectify the mistake (m) are present, the court should decide that the contract is voidable (o)." Omitting the absence of a contractual right to rectify the mistake (m) from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of enforcing contracts that are fundamentally unfair and inequitable due to significant disparities in value, thereby causing severe financial loss to one party (q). Indeed, the opinion in HCMP 180/2005 explicitly states that the Vendor's ability to seek a re-grant from the Government was crucial to their decision, as it provided a clear path to rectify the title issue and uphold the contract.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCMP 180/2005 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of parties easily voiding contracts based on mistaken assumptions about the quality of the subject matter, thereby upholding contractual certainty and the implied warranty of title (u). However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because the significant disparity in value due to the mistake fundamentally alters the nature of the contract, making it unfair and inequitable to enforce. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of a contractual right to rectify the mistake (m), which was present in the precedent case HCMP 180/2005, requiring this factor for all similar cases of a common mistake as to the quality of the subject matter (fact pattern i*) would lead to the undesirable consequence of enforcing contracts that are fundamentally unfair and inequitable due to significant disparities in value. Conversely, not requiring the presence of a contractual right to rectify the mistake (m) would allow for a more equitable outcome, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and justice in contract law. This approach ensures that parties are not unduly penalized for mistakes that significantly alter the nature of the contract and its value.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of a contractual right to rectify the mistake (m), which was present in HCMP 180/2005, we have the additional factor of a significant disparity in the value of the subject matter due to the mistake (n). This significant disparity in value, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of a common mistake as to the quality of the subject matter (i*), serves a similar function to the contractual right to rectify the mistake (m) in the precedent case. Given the presence of this significant disparity in value (n), we submit that the reasoning in HCMP 180/2005 still applies, as the positive effects on fairness and equity would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. This ensures that the contract is not enforced in a manner that would cause severe financial loss and undermine the principles of justice in contract law.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCMP 180/2005, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of a common mistake regarding the quality of the subject matter and the implied warranty of title. However, it also differs significantly in that the current case involves a substantial disparity in value due to the mistake, and there is no contractual right to rectify the mistake, unlike in HCMP 180/2005.

The proposed legal rule from HCMP 180/2005, which suggests that a contract is not void but may allow for remedies such as specific performance or damages in the presence of a common mistake as to the quality of the subject matter, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the significant disparity in value in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that enforcing the contract in the current case would lead to severe financial loss for Reah and undermine the principles of fairness and equity in contract law. On the other hand, the argument for upholding contractual certainty and the implied warranty of title is also compelling.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, equity, and the need to prevent unjust enrichment, as well as the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the contract between Felicity and Reah should be voidable due to the significant disparity in value caused by the common mistake. This decision aligns with the principles of justice and legal consistency, ensuring that parties are not unduly penalized for mistakes that fundamentally alter the nature and value of the contract.

Therefore, Reah should not be required to proceed with the contract, and she should be entitled to rescind the agreement and seek any appropriate remedies for the misapprehension about the quality and origin of the stained glass panel. This outcome balances the need for contractual certainty with the principles of fairness and equity, providing a just resolution to the issue at hand.


# Contract Law: Whether the mistake as to the quality of the stained glass panel is a common mistake

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 16 Subsection 3, Section 16 Subsection 2, Section 55 Subsection 1, and Section 55 Subsections 2 and 3

### Major Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 16 Subsection 3

   Conditions:
   - The seller sells goods in the course of a business
   - The buyer, expressly or by implication, makes known to the seller any particular purpose for which the goods are being bought
   - There is an implied condition that the goods supplied under the contract are reasonably fit for that purpose

   Consequences:
   - The goods supplied under the contract must be reasonably fit for the particular purpose made known by the buyer

   Exceptions:
   - Where the circumstances show that the buyer does not rely, or that it is unreasonable for him to rely, on the seller’s skill or judgment

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 16 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - The seller sells goods in the course of a business
   - The goods supplied under the contract are of merchantable quality

   Consequences:
   - There is an implied condition that the goods supplied under the contract are of merchantable quality

   Exceptions:
   - As regards defects specifically drawn to the buyer’s attention before the contract is made
   - If the buyer examines the goods before the contract is made, as regards defects which that examination ought to reveal
   - If the contract is a contract for sale by sample, as regards defects which would have been apparent on a reasonable examination of the sample

3. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 55 Subsection 1

   Conditions:
   - There is a breach of warranty by the seller
   - The buyer elects, or is compelled, to treat any breach of a condition on the part of the seller as a breach of warranty

   Consequences:
   - The buyer is not entitled to reject the goods by reason only of such breach of warranty
   - The buyer may set up against the seller the breach of warranty in diminution or extinction of the price
   - The buyer may maintain an action against the seller for damages for the breach of warranty

   Exceptions:
   - None

4. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 55 Subsections 2 and 3

   Conditions:
   - There is a breach of warranty of quality

   Consequences:
   - The measure of damages for breach of warranty is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the breach of warranty
   - Such loss is prima facie the difference between the value of the goods at the time of delivery to the buyer and the value they would have had if they had answered to the warranty

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 16 Subsection 3:
   - Felicity is not selling the stained glass panel in the course of a business; she is selling an inherited item.
   - Reah did not make known to Felicity any particular purpose for which the stained glass panel was being bought.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 16 Subsection 2:
   - Felicity is not selling the stained glass panel in the course of a business; she is selling an inherited item.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

3. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 55 Subsection 1:
   - There is no indication of a breach of warranty by Felicity.
   - Reah has not elected to treat any breach of a condition as a breach of warranty.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

4. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 55 Subsections 2 and 3:
   - There is no indication of a breach of warranty of quality by Felicity.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

### Conclusion:

The Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Sections 16 and 55 do not apply to this scenario as Felicity is not selling the stained glass panel in the course of a business, and there is no breach of warranty or condition. The doctrine of mistake may be considered, but under the Sale of Goods Ordinance, Reah does not have a remedy to avoid the contract based on the provided facts. Reah may need to explore other legal avenues, such as the doctrine of common mistake under general contract law principles, to determine if the contract can be voided.

### Minor Premise:

1. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited:
- Felicity and Reah have made an agreement for the sale of a stained glass panel.
- The agreement did not include a term about the quality or origin of the panel.
- Reah thought she was buying an original work by Clarky, but it was actually a piece done by Clarky's students.
- Felicity did not know that Reah thought the panel was an original work by Clarky.

2. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited:
- The agreement between Felicity and Reah did not mistakenly leave out a term about the quality or origin of the panel.
- Felicity did not know that Reah thought the panel was an original work by Clarky.

3. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited:
- Felicity and Reah made an agreement for the sale of the stained glass panel.
- Felicity did not know that Reah thought the panel was an original work by Clarky.
- The mistake is about the quality or origin of the panel, not about whether the document correctly reflects the terms previously agreed.

### Conclusion:

The doctrine of mistake as outlined in Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited does not apply to this scenario. The mistake is about the quality or origin of the stained glass panel, and there was no term mistakenly left out of the agreement. Therefore, Reah must proceed with the contract as agreed.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD)

In the case of BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD (precedent p), the court ruled that the contract could be rescinded due to misrepresentation and that the solicitor was not negligent as they had acted in accordance with the general practice of the profession. The court emphasized that a solicitor's duty includes understanding the terms of the retainer, protecting the client's interest, and ensuring the client understands the documents they sign. The court also noted that a mistake by the solicitor is not conclusive of negligence if it aligns with the general practice of the profession.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Common Mistake**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In both cases, there was a fundamental mistake regarding the subject matter of the contract. In BRIGHT GOLD, the mistake was about the roof area included in the property. In our current case, the mistake is about the quality and origin of the stained glass panel.

- **Legal Concept 2: Misrepresentation**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** In BRIGHT GOLD, the misrepresentation was about the property features. In our current case, although not explicitly stated, there is an implicit misrepresentation about the stained glass panel being an original work by Clarky.

- **Legal Concept 3: Duty to Ascertain Subject Matter**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In BRIGHT GOLD, the solicitor had a duty to ascertain the subject matter of the sale. In our current case, Reah had a duty to ascertain the authenticity and value of the stained glass panel before finalizing the purchase.

- **Legal Concept 4: Rescission of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** In BRIGHT GOLD, the court allowed rescission of the contract due to misrepresentation. In our current case, Reah seeks to rescind the contract due to a fundamental mistake about the quality of the stained glass panel.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see a fundamental mistake regarding the subject matter of the contract (fact pattern i*), the court should decide that the contract can be rescinded (outcome o). This rule was justified in BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD because the positive effects (E+) of allowing rescission due to a fundamental mistake or misrepresentation uphold the principles of fairness and equity in contractual dealings, outweighing the negative effects (E-) of potentially disrupting contractual certainty.

In our current case, applying this rule would mean that Reah should be entitled to rescind the contract for the stained glass panel, as the fundamental mistake about its quality and origin significantly affects the value and nature of what she believed she was purchasing.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Common Mistake**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In both cases, there was a fundamental mistake regarding the subject matter of the contract. In BRIGHT GOLD, the mistake was about the roof area included in the property. In our current case, the mistake is about the quality and origin of the stained glass panel.

- **Legal Concept 2: Misrepresentation**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** In BRIGHT GOLD, the misrepresentation was about the property features. In our current case, although not explicitly stated, there is an implicit misrepresentation about the stained glass panel being an original work by Clarky.

- **Legal Concept 3: Duty to Ascertain Subject Matter**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In BRIGHT GOLD, the solicitor had a duty to ascertain the subject matter of the sale. In our current case, Reah had a duty to ascertain the authenticity and value of the stained glass panel before finalizing the purchase.

- **Legal Concept 4: Rescission of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** In BRIGHT GOLD, the court allowed rescission of the contract due to misrepresentation. In our current case, Reah seeks to rescind the contract due to a fundamental mistake about the quality of the stained glass panel.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome of allowing rescission of the contract. This decision would be justified because, as in BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Fairness and Equity:** Allowing rescission due to a fundamental mistake or misrepresentation ensures that parties are not unfairly bound by contracts that do not reflect their true intentions or understanding. This promotes fairness and equity in contractual dealings.

2. **Protecting Parties from Unjust Enrichment:** By rescinding the contract, the court prevents Felicity from being unjustly enriched at Reah's expense. Reah believed she was purchasing a valuable original work by Clarky, not a piece created by beginner students.

3. **Maintaining Trust in Commercial Transactions:** Ensuring that contracts can be rescinded in cases of fundamental mistakes or misrepresentations helps maintain trust in commercial transactions. Parties are more likely to engage in transactions if they know that the law provides remedies for such situations.

4. **Encouraging Due Diligence:** While the decision allows for rescission, it also underscores the importance of due diligence. Parties are reminded to thoroughly investigate and verify the subject matter of their contracts to avoid such disputes.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome of allowing rescission of the contract. This decision would be justified because, as in BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD, it would have the positive effects of upholding fairness and equity, protecting parties from unjust enrichment, maintaining trust in commercial transactions, and encouraging due diligence.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of **misrepresentation**. Misrepresentation was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling (rescission of the contract) outweighed any potential drawbacks because it directly affected the fairness and equity of the contractual dealings. The misrepresentation in BRIGHT GOLD was about the property features, which were explicitly stated and relied upon by the purchaser.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of **explicit misrepresentation** is notably absent. Felicity did not explicitly misrepresent the stained glass panel as an original work by Clarky. Instead, Reah assumed its authenticity and value without any explicit statement from Felicity. This absence of explicit misrepresentation weakens the argument for rescission based on the same grounds as in BRIGHT GOLD.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor **(Reah's reliance on her own assumption about the panel's authenticity)** that was not present in **BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of **common mistake**. In BRIGHT GOLD, the mistake was induced by the vendor's misrepresentation, whereas in our current case, the mistake arises from Reah's own assumption without any explicit misrepresentation by Felicity.

Due to Reah's reliance on her own assumption, applying the same outcome of rescission in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the principle of caveat emptor (buyer beware) and potentially encouraging buyers to neglect due diligence, unlike in BRIGHT GOLD where the misrepresentation justified the rescission. Therefore, the presence of Reah's assumption significantly alters the balance of positive and negative effects, making the application of the same outcome inappropriate in our current case.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD** should be stated as 'When both [a fundamental mistake regarding the subject matter of the contract] and [explicit misrepresentation by one party] are present, the court should decide [to allow rescission of the contract].' Omitting [explicit misrepresentation by one party] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q], which is undermining the principle of caveat emptor (buyer beware) and potentially encouraging buyers to neglect due diligence. Indeed, the opinion in **BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD** explicitly states that [misrepresentation] was crucial to their decision, as it directly affected the fairness and equity of the contractual dealings.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties being unfairly bound by contracts due to misrepresentation]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [misrepresentation] occurring, as Felicity did not explicitly misrepresent the stained glass panel as an original work by Clarky. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the explicit misrepresentation factor, which was present in the precedent case **BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of fundamental mistake would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would mean that parties who make genuine mistakes about the subject matter of a contract would be unfairly bound by those contracts, even when the mistake is fundamental and significantly affects the value and nature of what was believed to be purchased. Conversely, not requiring explicit misrepresentation would allow for a more equitable outcome, where parties are not unfairly penalized for genuine mistakes. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which aim to ensure fairness and equity in contractual dealings and to prevent unjust enrichment.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the explicit misrepresentation factor, which was present in **BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD**, we have the additional factor of Reah's reliance on the specialist valuer's assessment. This reliance, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of a fundamental mistake regarding the subject matter of the contract, serves a similar function to explicit misrepresentation in the precedent case. Given the presence of Reah's reliance on the specialist valuer's assessment, we submit that the reasoning in **BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD** still applies. The positive effects on relevant legal values, such as upholding fairness and equity, protecting parties from unjust enrichment, and maintaining trust in commercial transactions, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **BRIGHT GOLD LTD v. MEGA WELL DEVELOPMENT LTD**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of a fundamental mistake regarding the subject matter of the contract and the significant impact of this mistake on the value and nature of the purchased item. However, it also differs in a crucial aspect: the absence of explicit misrepresentation by Felicity, which was a pivotal factor in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule of allowing rescission of the contract when both a fundamental mistake and explicit misrepresentation are present finds strong support in the precedent. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in cases where explicit misrepresentation is absent but the mistake is still fundamental and significantly affects the contract.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that explicit misrepresentation was crucial in the precedent case (Step 5-8) and the counterargument that Reah's reliance on the specialist valuer's assessment serves a similar function to explicit misrepresentation (Step 9-10).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, equity, and the prevention of unjust enrichment, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Reah should be entitled to rescind the contract. This decision aligns with the principle that parties should not be unfairly bound by contracts that do not reflect their true intentions or understanding, even in the absence of explicit misrepresentation. The reliance on the specialist valuer's assessment, combined with the fundamental mistake, justifies rescission to uphold fairness and equity in this particular case.

Therefore, Reah is not obligated to proceed with the contract, as the fundamental mistake regarding the quality and origin of the stained glass panel significantly affects the nature of what she believed she was purchasing. This decision ensures that justice and legal consistency are maintained, preventing unjust enrichment and promoting trust in commercial transactions.

## Deductive Reasoning: cfa

### Relevant law:

Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited

### Major Premise:

1. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited

   Conditions:
   - The contract contains a provision which one party knows that the other party thinks is not there, or knows that the other party is mistaken about its meaning.
   - The mistaken belief is about what the contract said or meant.

   Consequences:
   - The court may, as a matter of discretion, either refuse to allow the party to enforce the contract as it would ordinarily be construed, or rectify the written agreement to give effect to what the mistaken party thought had been agreed.

   Exceptions:
   - The party resisting rectification is acting in good faith and genuinely believes the written document reflects what was agreed.

### Minor Premise:

1. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited:
- The contract between Felicity and Reah contains a provision (the sale of the stained glass panel) which Reah thinks is a valuable piece of Clarky's work.
- Felicity knows that Reah is mistaken about the meaning of the contract, specifically the quality and origin of the stained glass panel.
- Reah's mistaken belief is about what the contract said or meant, as she believed she was purchasing an original work by Clarky worth £50,000, not a student piece worth £5,000.
- Felicity may argue that she genuinely believed the written document (the agreement to sell the panel) reflects what was agreed, but the facts suggest she knew or should have known about the mistaken belief of Reah.

### Conclusion:

Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited applies, and the court may, as a matter of discretion, either refuse to allow Felicity to enforce the contract as it would ordinarily be construed, or rectify the written agreement to give effect to what Reah thought had been agreed. Given the circumstances, it is likely that the court would rectify the agreement to reflect Reah's understanding, thereby allowing her to avoid the contract or adjust the price to reflect the true value of the stained glass panel.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCMP 180/2005)
In the case of HCMP 180/2005 BETWEEN TONY INVESTMENTS LIMITED (德隆投資有限公司) Plaintiff and FUNG SUN KWAN BERNARD (馮燊均) (alias FUNG SUN KWAN) trading as KWONG YEE WOO (SHIPBUILDING CONTRACTORS) Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the Vendor had no title to the Former Slipway and thus could not convey good title to the Purchaser. The court found that the Vendor's failure to obtain a re-grant from the Government meant that the Vendor could not fulfill the contractual obligation to transfer the property, and the Purchaser was entitled to specific performance or damages.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCMP 180/2005 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Mistake as to Quality of Subject Matter**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Vendor and Purchaser had a misunderstanding regarding the Vendor's title to the Former Slipway, which was a fundamental aspect of the property being sold.
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In our current case, Reah and Felicity had a misunderstanding regarding the quality and origin of the stained glass panel, which was a fundamental aspect of the item being sold.

- **Legal Concept 2: Implied Warranty of Title**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCMP 180/2005, it was implied that the Vendor warranted good title to the property, which he failed to provide.
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In our current case, it is implied that Felicity warranted the stained glass panel as an original work by Clarky, which she failed to provide.

- **Legal Concept 3: Impact of Mistake on Contract Validity**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCMP 180/2005, the mistake regarding the Vendor's title was so fundamental that it affected the validity of the contract.
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In our current case, the mistake regarding the stained glass panel's origin and value is so fundamental that it affects the validity of the contract.

- **Legal Concept 4: Specific Performance and Damages**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCMP 180/2005, the court considered whether specific performance or damages were appropriate remedies given the fundamental mistake.
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In our current case, Reah is considering whether she can avoid the contract or seek damages due to the fundamental mistake.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCMP 180/2005)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fundamental mistake regarding the quality or title of the subject matter of a contract, the court should decide that the contract is voidable. This rule was justified in HCMP 180/2005 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that parties are not bound by contracts based on fundamental misunderstandings outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially voiding contracts.

In HCMP 180/2005, the court found that the Vendor's inability to provide good title due to a fundamental mistake justified the Purchaser's right to avoid the contract or seek specific performance. Similarly, in our current case, the fundamental mistake regarding the stained glass panel's origin and value justifies Reah's right to avoid the contract or seek damages. This rule upholds the principle that contracts should be based on mutual understanding and accurate representations of the subject matter.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCMP 180/2005) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Mistake as to Quality of Subject Matter**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Vendor and Purchaser had a misunderstanding regarding the Vendor's title to the Former Slipway, which was a fundamental aspect of the property being sold.
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In our current case, Reah and Felicity had a misunderstanding regarding the quality and origin of the stained glass panel, which was a fundamental aspect of the item being sold.

- **Legal Concept 2: Implied Warranty of Title**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCMP 180/2005, it was implied that the Vendor warranted good title to the property, which he failed to provide.
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In our current case, it is implied that Felicity warranted the stained glass panel as an original work by Clarky, which she failed to provide.

- **Legal Concept 3: Impact of Mistake on Contract Validity**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCMP 180/2005, the mistake regarding the Vendor's title was so fundamental that it affected the validity of the contract.
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In our current case, the mistake regarding the stained glass panel's origin and value is so fundamental that it affects the validity of the contract.

- **Legal Concept 4: Specific Performance and Damages**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCMP 180/2005, the court considered whether specific performance or damages were appropriate remedies given the fundamental mistake.
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In our current case, Reah is considering whether she can avoid the contract or seek damages due to the fundamental mistake.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome: the contract should be voidable due to the fundamental mistake. This decision would be justified because, as in HCMP 180/2005, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Mutual Understanding**: Ensuring that contracts are based on mutual understanding and accurate representations of the subject matter promotes fairness and trust in contractual relationships.
2. **Preventing Unjust Enrichment**: Allowing Reah to avoid the contract prevents Felicity from being unjustly enriched by selling an item that was misrepresented, even if unintentionally.
3. **Encouraging Due Diligence**: This outcome encourages parties to conduct thorough due diligence and ensure accurate representations before entering into contracts, thereby reducing the likelihood of disputes.
4. **Maintaining Market Integrity**: By voiding contracts based on fundamental mistakes, the court helps maintain the integrity of the market, ensuring that transactions are based on accurate and reliable information.

Therefore, the court should find that Reah is entitled to avoid the contract due to the fundamental mistake regarding the stained glass panel's origin and value. This decision aligns with the principles established in HCMP 180/2005 and supports the underlying values of fairness, trust, and market integrity.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCMP 180/2005, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the Vendor had a contractual right against the Government to seek a re-grant of the Former Slipway at a nominal premium. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling (upholding the Purchaser's right to specific performance or damages) outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided a clear and actionable path for the Vendor to fulfill the contractual obligation, thereby minimizing the risk of non-performance.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent. Felicity does not have any similar contractual right or mechanism to rectify the fundamental mistake regarding the stained glass panel's origin and value. There is no equivalent re-grant or corrective action that Felicity can take to transform the panel into an original work by Clarky. This absence of a remedial mechanism significantly impacts the feasibility of specific performance and the overall balance of positive and negative effects.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in HCMP 180/2005: the subjective valuation and emotional significance attached to the artwork by Reah. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the value of art is often highly subjective and influenced by provenance, authenticity, and the artist's reputation. Due to this factor, applying the same outcome (voiding the contract) in our case would have more negative consequences, such as undermining the trust and reliability in art transactions, than positive ones.

In HCMP 180/2005, the subject matter was a piece of land, which has a more objective and quantifiable value. The absence of subjective valuation in the precedent case meant that the court could focus on the legal title and contractual obligations without considering the emotional and subjective aspects. In contrast, the current case involves an artwork whose value is intrinsically linked to its authenticity and the artist's identity. Therefore, the presence of this subjective valuation factor in our case necessitates a different approach to ensure that the ruling does not disproportionately harm the parties involved and the broader art market.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from HCMP 180/2005 should be stated as: "When both a fundamental mistake regarding the quality or title of the subject matter of a contract and a mechanism for rectifying the mistake are present, the court should decide that the contract is voidable." Omitting the mechanism for rectifying the mistake from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of parties being bound by contracts that cannot be fulfilled as originally intended, thereby causing significant unfairness and potential financial harm. Indeed, the opinion in HCMP 180/2005 explicitly states that the Vendor's contractual right to seek a re-grant from the Government was crucial to their decision, as it provided a clear path for fulfilling the contractual obligation.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in HCMP 180/2005 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of parties being bound by contracts that cannot be fulfilled due to a fundamental mistake, while also ensuring that there is a feasible mechanism for rectifying the mistake. However, in our current case, there is no risk of this specific undesirable consequence occurring because there is no equivalent mechanism for rectifying the mistake regarding the stained glass panel's origin and value. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should recognize that the absence of a rectifying mechanism makes the contract fundamentally different from what was contemplated by the parties, justifying Reah's right to avoid the contract.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the mechanism for rectifying the mistake (factor m), which was present in the precedent case HCMP 180/2005, requiring this factor for all similar cases of fundamental mistake regarding the quality or title of the subject matter would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would mean that parties could be unfairly bound by contracts based on fundamental misunderstandings simply because there is no clear mechanism to rectify the mistake. Conversely, not requiring the presence of a rectifying mechanism would allow for a more equitable outcome, where parties are not held to contracts that are fundamentally different from what they believed they were entering into. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which emphasize fairness, mutual understanding, and the accurate representation of the subject matter.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the mechanism for rectifying the mistake (factor m), which was present in HCMP 180/2005, we have the additional factor of subjective valuation and emotional significance attached to the artwork (factor n). This factor n, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of a fundamental mistake regarding the quality or title of the subject matter, serves a similar function to the rectifying mechanism in the precedent case. Given the presence of subjective valuation and emotional significance, we submit that the reasoning in HCMP 180/2005 still applies. The positive effects on legal values, such as upholding mutual understanding, preventing unjust enrichment, encouraging due diligence, and maintaining market integrity, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. Therefore, Reah should be entitled to avoid the contract due to the fundamental mistake regarding the stained glass panel's origin and value.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCMP 180/2005, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as a fundamental mistake regarding the quality or title of the subject matter and the implied warranty of title. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of a mechanism for rectifying the mistake in the current case and the presence of subjective valuation and emotional significance attached to the artwork.

The proposed legal rule from HCMP 180/2005, which suggests that a contract is voidable when there is a fundamental mistake regarding the quality or title of the subject matter and a mechanism for rectifying the mistake, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in contexts where no rectifying mechanism exists.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the absence of a rectifying mechanism in the current case makes the contract fundamentally different from what was contemplated by the parties, justifying Reah's right to avoid the contract. On the other hand, the argument that subjective valuation and emotional significance should not be overlooked in art transactions also holds considerable weight.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, mutual understanding, and accurate representation of the subject matter, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Reah should be entitled to avoid the contract due to the fundamental mistake regarding the stained glass panel's origin and value. This decision aligns with the principles established in HCMP 180/2005 while also addressing the unique aspects of the current case, such as the subjective valuation of art and the absence of a rectifying mechanism.

Therefore, the contract between Reah and Felicity is voidable, and Reah is not obligated to proceed with the purchase of the stained glass panel. This outcome serves justice and legal consistency by ensuring that contracts are based on mutual understanding and accurate representations, particularly in transactions involving unique and valuable items like artwork.

   - If the contract is a contract for sale by sample, as regards defects which would have been apparent on a reasonable examination of the sample.

### Minor Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 16 Subsection 3:
- Felicity is not selling the stained glass panel in the course of a business; she is selling an inherited item from her father’s studio.
- Reah did not make known to Felicity any particular purpose for which the stained glass panel was being bought.

   Conditions:
   - There is a common mistake about whether a written document correctly reflects what the parties had, on an objective assessment, agreed it should contain; or
   - There is a unilateral mistake where one party knows that the other party thinks a term is not there, or knows that the other party is mistaken about its meaning

   Consequences:
   - The court may rectify the document to reflect the true agreement of the parties

   Exceptions:
   - The court cannot predicate with certainty what the contract was, and that it is, by common mistake, wrongly expressed in the document

### Minor Premise:

1. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited:
- There is a mutual mistake about the quality of the stained glass panel. Both Felicity and Reah believed it to be an original work by Clarky, but it was actually a piece created by his evening beginner class students.
- The mistake is about the quality and value of the item, not about the terms previously agreed in the contract.
- The court can predicate with certainty what the contract was: the sale of the stained glass panel for £50,000.

2. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited:
- There is a mutual mistake about the quality of the stained glass panel.
- The mistake is about the quality and value of the item, not about the terms previously agreed in the contract.
- The court can predicate with certainty what the contract was: the sale of the stained glass panel for £50,000.

3. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited:
- There is a common mistake about the quality of the stained glass panel.
- The mistake is about the quality and value of the item, not about the terms previously agreed in the contract.
- The court can predicate with certainty what the contract was: the sale of the stained glass panel for £50,000.

### Conclusion:

The doctrine of mistake applies, and the court may refuse to allow Reah to enforce the contract as it would ordinarily be construed, given the mutual mistake about the quality and value of the stained glass panel. Therefore, Reah does not have to proceed with the contract.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCMP 180/2005)
In the case of HCMP 180/2005 BETWEEN TONY INVESTMENTS LIMITED (德隆投資有限公司) Plaintiff and FUNG SUN KWAN BERNARD (馮燊均) (alias FUNG SUN KWAN) trading as KWONG YEE WOO (SHIPBUILDING CONTRACTORS) Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the Vendor had no title to the Former Slipway and that the requisitions for a re-grant were reasonable. The Vendor failed to show good title, and the Purchaser was entitled to specific performance and damages.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCMP 180/2005 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Mistake as to Quality of Subject Matter**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Vendor mistakenly believed they had title to the Former Slipway, which was a fundamental aspect of the property being sold. In our current case, Reah mistakenly believed the stained glass panel was an original work by Clarky, which was a fundamental aspect of the purchase.

- **Legal Concept 2: Implied Warranty of Title**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCMP 180/2005, it was implied that the Vendor warranted they had good title to the property. In our current case, it is implied that Felicity warranted the stained glass panel was an original work by Clarky.

- **Legal Concept 3: Fundamental Mistake Rendering Contract Void**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCMP 180/2005, the court found that the Vendor's mistake about the title was fundamental, affecting the essence of the contract. In our current case, Reah's mistake about the origin of the stained glass panel affects the essence of the contract.

- **Legal Concept 4: Specific Performance and Damages**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCMP 180/2005, the court granted specific performance and damages due to the Vendor's failure to show good title. In our current case, Reah seeks to avoid the contract due to the fundamental mistake about the quality of the stained glass panel.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCMP 180/2005)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fundamental mistake about the quality or title of the subject matter of a contract, the court should decide that the contract is void. This rule was justified in HCMP 180/2005 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that parties are not bound by contracts based on fundamental mistakes outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially voiding contracts. This promotes fairness and prevents unjust enrichment.

In Reah's case, the fundamental mistake about the stained glass panel's origin and value means that the contract should be considered void. Reah should not be bound to proceed with the contract, as she has not bought what she thought she was buying.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCMP 180/2005) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Mistake as to Quality of Subject Matter**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Vendor mistakenly believed they had title to the Former Slipway, which was a fundamental aspect of the property being sold. In our current case, Reah mistakenly believed the stained glass panel was an original work by Clarky, which was a fundamental aspect of the purchase.

- **Legal Concept 2: Implied Warranty of Title**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCMP 180/2005, it was implied that the Vendor warranted they had good title to the property. In our current case, it is implied that Felicity warranted the stained glass panel was an original work by Clarky.

- **Legal Concept 3: Fundamental Mistake Rendering Contract Void**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCMP 180/2005, the court found that the Vendor's mistake about the title was fundamental, affecting the essence of the contract. In our current case, Reah's mistake about the origin of the stained glass panel affects the essence of the contract.

- **Legal Concept 4: Specific Performance and Damages**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCMP 180/2005, the court granted specific performance and damages due to the Vendor's failure to show good title. In our current case, Reah seeks to avoid the contract due to the fundamental mistake about the quality of the stained glass panel.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome: the contract should be considered void due to the fundamental mistake about the quality and origin of the stained glass panel. This decision would be justified because, as in HCMP 180/2005, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Promoting Fairness**: Ensuring that parties are not bound by contracts based on fundamental mistakes promotes fairness in contractual dealings. Reah believed she was purchasing an original work by Clarky, which significantly influenced her decision to offer £50,000. Binding her to this contract when the panel is worth only £5,000 would be unjust.

2. **Preventing Unjust Enrichment**: Allowing the contract to stand would unjustly enrich Felicity, who would receive a significantly higher amount than the actual value of the stained glass panel. This would be contrary to the principles of equity and justice.

3. **Encouraging Due Diligence**: This outcome would encourage parties to conduct thorough due diligence before entering into contracts, thereby reducing the likelihood of similar disputes in the future.

4. **Maintaining Market Integrity**: Ensuring that transactions are based on accurate representations of the subject matter helps maintain the integrity of the market, particularly in the art world where provenance and authenticity are crucial.

Therefore, the court should find that the contract between Reah and Felicity is void due to the fundamental mistake regarding the stained glass panel's origin and value. This would align with the principles established in HCMP 180/2005 and promote fairness, prevent unjust enrichment, encourage due diligence, and maintain market integrity.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCMP 180/2005, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the Vendor had a contractual right against the Government to seek a re-grant of the Former Slipway at a nominal premium. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling (promoting fairness, preventing unjust enrichment, encouraging due diligence, and maintaining market integrity) outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided a clear path for the Vendor to rectify the title issue and fulfill the contract. However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as there is no similar mechanism or right for Reah to rectify the mistake regarding the stained glass panel's origin and value. The absence of such a mechanism means that Reah cannot easily correct the fundamental mistake, making the situation less straightforward than in HCMP 180/2005.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in HCMP 180/2005: the involvement of a specialist valuer who provided an expert opinion on the stained glass panel's origin and value. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces an element of professional assessment that was not present in the precedent case. Due to the specialist valuer's opinion, applying the same outcome (voiding the contract) in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the reliability of professional valuations and potentially leading to more disputes over expert opinions than positive ones, unlike in HCMP 180/2005. The presence of the specialist valuer's assessment adds a layer of complexity that was not considered in the precedent case, making it less clear-cut to void the contract based on a fundamental mistake.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCMP 180/2005 should be stated as "When both a fundamental mistake about the quality or title of the subject matter of a contract (i*) and a mechanism or right to rectify the mistake (m) are present, the court should decide that the contract is void (o)." Omitting the mechanism or right to rectify the mistake (m) from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence (q) of parties being bound by contracts based on fundamental mistakes without any feasible way to correct the situation. Indeed, the opinion in HCMP 180/2005 explicitly states that the Vendor's contractual right against the Government to seek a re-grant was crucial to their decision, as it provided a clear path to rectify the title issue and fulfill the contract.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCMP 180/2005 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence (u) of parties being unfairly bound by contracts based on fundamental mistakes when there is no feasible way to rectify the mistake. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence (u) occurring because the presence of a specialist valuer's assessment introduces an element of professional evaluation that was not considered in the precedent case. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The professional assessment provides a different context, suggesting that the contract should not be voided solely based on the fundamental mistake about the stained glass panel's origin and value.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the mechanism or right to rectify the mistake (m), which was present in the precedent case HCMP 180/2005, requiring this factor for all similar cases of fundamental mistake about the quality or title of the subject matter of a contract would lead to the undesirable consequence of parties being unfairly bound by contracts based on fundamental mistakes without any feasible way to correct the situation. Conversely, not requiring the mechanism or right to rectify the mistake (m) would allow for a more equitable outcome, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and justice in contract law. This approach ensures that parties are not unjustly enriched and that contracts are based on accurate representations of the subject matter.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the mechanism or right to rectify the mistake (m), which was present in HCMP 180/2005, we have the additional factor of a specialist valuer's assessment (n). This specialist valuer's assessment, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of a fundamental mistake about the quality of the subject matter (i*), serves a similar function to the mechanism or right to rectify the mistake (m) in the precedent case. Given the presence of the specialist valuer's assessment (n), we submit that the reasoning in HCMP 180/2005 still applies, as the positive effects on promoting fairness, preventing unjust enrichment, encouraging due diligence, and maintaining market integrity would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCMP 180/2005, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly the fundamental mistake about the quality of the subject matter and the implied warranty of title. However, it also differs in significant ways, notably the absence of a mechanism or right to rectify the mistake in the current case and the involvement of a specialist valuer's assessment.

The proposed legal rule from HCMP 180/2005, which suggests that a contract should be void when there is a fundamental mistake about the quality or title of the subject matter, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the absence of a rectification mechanism in the current case and the presence of a professional valuation.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the fundamental mistake about the stained glass panel's origin and value significantly affects the essence of the contract (supporting Reah's position) and the counterargument that the professional valuation introduces a layer of complexity not present in the precedent case (supporting the view that the contract should not be voided solely based on the mistake).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, prevention of unjust enrichment, and the integrity of contractual dealings, we conclude that the contract between Reah and Felicity should be considered void due to the fundamental mistake regarding the stained glass panel's origin and value. This decision aligns with the principles established in HCMP 180/2005 and promotes fairness, prevents unjust enrichment, encourages due diligence, and maintains market integrity.

The key factors influencing this outcome include the significant impact of the fundamental mistake on the essence of the contract and the absence of a feasible way for Reah to rectify the mistake. While the professional valuation adds complexity, it does not outweigh the need to ensure that contracts are based on accurate representations of the subject matter. Therefore, Reah should not be bound to proceed with the contract, as she has not bought what she thought she was buying.

   - If the buyer accepts the goods so delivered, he must pay for them at the contract rate.

   Exceptions:
   - There is any usage of trade, special agreement, or course of dealing between the parties.

3. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 16 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - There is a contract of sale.
   - The seller delivers to the buyer goods which are not of merchantable quality.
   - The defects were not specifically drawn to the buyer's attention before the contract is made.

   - The buyer examines the goods before the contract is made, as regards defects which that examination ought to reveal.
   - The contract is a contract for sale by sample, as regards defects which would have been apparent on a reasonable examination of the sample.

4. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 16 Subsection 3

   Conditions:
   - There is a contract of sale.
   - The seller sells goods in the course of a business.
   - The buyer, expressly or by implication, makes known to the seller any particular purpose for which the goods are being bought.

   Consequences:

   - There is an implied condition that the goods shall be free from any defect, rendering them unmerchantable, which would not be apparent on reasonable examination of the sample.

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 8:
   - There is a contract for the sale of goods between Felicity and Reah.
   - The goods (stained glass panel) have not perished at the time when the contract is made.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 32:
   - There is a contract of sale between Felicity and Reah.
   - The seller (Felicity) has not delivered the goods yet.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

3. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 16 Subsection 2:
   - There is a contract of sale between Felicity and Reah.
   - The seller (Felicity) has not delivered the goods yet.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

4. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 16 Subsection 3:
   - There is a contract of sale between Felicity and Reah.
   - The seller (Felicity) is not selling goods in the course of a business; she is selling inherited goods.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

5. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 17:
   - There is a contract of sale between Felicity and Reah.
   - The contract is not a contract for sale by sample.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

### Conclusion:

None of the sections of the Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 apply to the scenario. The doctrine of mistake in this context would likely fall under common law principles rather than specific statutory provisions. Under common law, a mistake as to the quality of the subject matter generally does not render a contract void unless it is a fundamental mistake that goes to the root of the contract. In this case, Reah's mistake about the value of the stained glass panel does not appear to be a fundamental mistake that would void the contract. Therefore, Reah is likely bound by the contract and must proceed with the purchase.

### Major Premise:

1. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited

   Conditions:
   - There is a mutual or common mistake about whether a written document correctly reflects what the parties had, on an objective assessment, agreed it should contain; or
   - There is a unilateral mistake where one party knows that the other party thinks a term is included or has a mistaken belief about its meaning

   Consequences:
   - The court may rectify the document to reflect the true agreement of the parties

   Exceptions:
   - The mistake is not about the terms previously agreed; or
   - The court cannot predicate with certainty what the contract was

### Minor Premise:

1. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited:
   - There is a mutual mistake between Felicity and Reah about the quality and value of the stained glass panel.
   - The mistake is about whether the stained glass panel is an original work by Clarky or a piece created by his students.
   - The mistake is not about the terms previously agreed, as both parties agreed on the sale of the stained glass panel for £50,000.
   - The court can predicate with certainty what the contract was: the sale of the stained glass panel for £50,000.

### Conclusion:

The doctrine of mistake as outlined in Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited applies. The court may rectify the contract to reflect the true agreement of the parties, which in this case would involve acknowledging the mutual mistake about the quality and value of the stained glass panel. Therefore, Reah may not have to proceed with the contract as originally agreed, and the court may adjust the terms to reflect the true nature of the agreement.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCMP 180/2005)
In the case of HCMP 180/2005 BETWEEN TONY INVESTMENTS LIMITED (德隆投資有限公司) Plaintiff and FUNG SUN KWAN BERNARD(馮燊均) (alias FUNG SUN KWAN) trading as KWONG YEE WOO (SHIPBUILDING CONTRACTORS) Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the Vendor had no title to the Former Slipway and that the Purchaser's requisitions were reasonable. The Vendor failed to show good title, and the defence of common mistake was not accepted. The court held that the contract was valid and enforceable, and specific performance was ordered.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCMP 180/2005 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Good Title and Misrepresentation**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Vendor failed to show good title to the Former Slipway, which was a fundamental aspect of the property being sold. In our current case, Felicity represented the stained glass panel as a valuable piece by Clarky, but it turned out to be a work by beginner students, fundamentally different from what Reah believed she was purchasing.

- **Legal Concept 2: Common Mistake**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Vendor and Purchaser had a common misapprehension regarding the Vendor's rights over the Former Slipway. In our current case, both Felicity and Reah were under the common misapprehension that the stained glass panel was an original work by Clarky, not a student piece.

- **Legal Concept 3: Implied Warranty of Title**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCMP 180/2005, it was implied that the Vendor warranted he had good title to sell the property. In our current case, it is implied that Felicity warranted the stained glass panel was an original work by Clarky, given its high value and her acceptance of the £50,000 offer.

- **Legal Concept 4: Specific Performance and Remedies**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCMP 180/2005, the court ordered specific performance as the Vendor had a contractual right to seek a re-grant to perfect his title. In our current case, Reah seeks to avoid the contract due to the fundamental mistake about the quality and value of the stained glass panel.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCMP 180/2005)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a common mistake regarding the fundamental quality or title of the subject matter of a contract, the court should decide that the contract is voidable. This rule was justified in HCMP 180/2005 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that parties are not bound by contracts based on fundamental misapprehensions about the subject matter outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially disrupting contractual certainty.

In HCMP 180/2005, the court emphasized the importance of good title and the implied warranty that the vendor has the right to sell the property. Similarly, in our current case, the fundamental mistake about the stained glass panel's origin and value means that Reah did not get what she believed she was purchasing. Therefore, applying the rule from HCMP 180/2005, Reah should be entitled to avoid the contract due to the common mistake regarding the quality and value of the stained glass panel.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCMP 180/2005) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Good Title and Misrepresentation**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Vendor failed to show good title to the Former Slipway, which was a fundamental aspect of the property being sold. In our current case, Felicity represented the stained glass panel as a valuable piece by Clarky, but it turned out to be a work by beginner students, fundamentally different from what Reah believed she was purchasing.

- **Legal Concept 2: Common Mistake**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Vendor and Purchaser had a common misapprehension regarding the Vendor's rights over the Former Slipway. In our current case, both Felicity and Reah were under the common misapprehension that the stained glass panel was an original work by Clarky, not a student piece.

- **Legal Concept 3: Implied Warranty of Title**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCMP 180/2005, it was implied that the Vendor warranted he had good title to sell the property. In our current case, it is implied that Felicity warranted the stained glass panel was an original work by Clarky, given its high value and her acceptance of the £50,000 offer.

- **Legal Concept 4: Specific Performance and Remedies**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCMP 180/2005, the court ordered specific performance as the Vendor had a contractual right to seek a re-grant to perfect his title. In our current case, Reah seeks to avoid the contract due to the fundamental mistake about the quality and value of the stained glass panel.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome: the contract should be voidable due to the common mistake regarding the quality and value of the stained glass panel. This decision would be justified because, as in HCMP 180/2005, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Protection of Parties from Fundamental Misapprehensions**: Ensuring that parties are not bound by contracts based on fundamental misapprehensions about the subject matter protects the integrity of contractual agreements and the reasonable expectations of the parties involved.

2. **Fairness and Equity**: Allowing Reah to avoid the contract due to the common mistake ensures fairness and equity, as she did not receive what she reasonably believed she was purchasing. This aligns with the principles of equity that aim to prevent unjust enrichment and ensure that parties are not unfairly disadvantaged by mistakes.

3. **Encouragement of Due Diligence**: This outcome encourages parties to conduct thorough due diligence and ensure accurate representations in contractual dealings, thereby promoting transparency and trust in commercial transactions.

4. **Consistency in Legal Precedents**: Applying the same rule as in HCMP 180/2005 ensures consistency in legal precedents, providing clarity and predictability in the application of the doctrine of mistake in contract law.

Therefore, the court should find that the contract between Felicity and Reah is voidable due to the common mistake regarding the quality and value of the stained glass panel, allowing Reah to rescind the contract and avoid the obligation to proceed with the purchase.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCMP 180/2005, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the Vendor had a contractual right to seek a re-grant from the Government to perfect his title. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling (i.e., enforcing the contract and ordering specific performance) outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided a clear path for the Vendor to fulfill his contractual obligations, thereby maintaining the integrity of the contractual agreement and protecting the Purchaser's expectations. However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as there is no similar mechanism or right available to Felicity to rectify the fundamental mistake regarding the quality and value of the stained glass panel. Felicity cannot transform the student work into an original piece by Clarky, and thus, there is no way to fulfill the original terms of the contract.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—the significant disparity in the value of the stained glass panel due to its actual origin as a student work rather than an original piece by Clarky—that was not present in HCMP 180/2005. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of common mistake. Because of this disparity in value, applying the same outcome (enforcing the contract) in our case would have more negative consequences, such as unjust enrichment of Felicity and significant financial loss to Reah, than positive ones. Unlike in HCMP 180/2005, where the Vendor had a clear path to rectify the title issue, there is no remedy available to correct the fundamental mistake about the stained glass panel's origin and value in our current case. Therefore, the contract should be voidable to prevent these negative consequences and ensure fairness and equity.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCMP 180/2005 should be stated as "When both a common mistake regarding the fundamental quality or title of the subject matter of a contract and a mechanism or right available to rectify the mistake are present, the court should decide that the contract is valid and enforceable." Omitting the mechanism or right to rectify the mistake from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of enforcing contracts where the fundamental mistake cannot be corrected, resulting in significant unfairness and financial loss to the disadvantaged party. Indeed, the opinion in HCMP 180/2005 explicitly states that the Vendor's contractual right to seek a re-grant from the Government was crucial to their decision, as it provided a clear path to fulfill the contractual obligations and maintain the integrity of the agreement.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCMP 180/2005 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of parties being bound by contracts based on fundamental misapprehensions about the subject matter, while still providing a mechanism to rectify the mistake and fulfill the contractual obligations. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because there is no mechanism or right available to Felicity to rectify the fundamental mistake regarding the quality and value of the stained glass panel. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The contract should be voidable to ensure fairness and equity, allowing Reah to rescind the contract and avoid the obligation to proceed with the purchase.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the mechanism or right available to rectify the mistake (factor m), which was present in the precedent case HCMP 180/2005, requiring this factor for all similar cases of common mistake regarding the fundamental quality or title of the subject matter would lead to the undesirable consequence of enforcing contracts where the fundamental mistake cannot be corrected. This would result in significant unfairness and financial loss to the disadvantaged party. Conversely, not requiring the mechanism or right to rectify the mistake would allow for the contract to be voidable, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and equity in contract law. This approach ensures that parties are not bound by contracts based on fundamental misapprehensions about the subject matter, thereby preventing unjust enrichment and protecting the reasonable expectations of the parties involved.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the mechanism or right available to rectify the mistake (factor m), which was present in HCMP 180/2005, we have the additional factor of a significant disparity in the value of the stained glass panel due to its actual origin as a student work rather than an original piece by Clarky (factor n). This significant disparity in value, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of common mistake regarding the fundamental quality of the subject matter, serves a similar function to the mechanism or right to rectify the mistake in the precedent case. Given the presence of this significant disparity in value, we submit that the reasoning in HCMP 180/2005 still applies, as the positive effects on fairness and equity would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. This ensures that Reah is not unfairly disadvantaged by the fundamental mistake and can rescind the contract to avoid significant financial loss.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCMP 180/2005, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of a common mistake regarding the fundamental quality or title of the subject matter and the implied warranty of title. However, it also differs significantly in that there is no mechanism or right available to rectify the mistake in the current case, unlike in HCMP 180/2005 where the Vendor had a contractual right to seek a re-grant from the Government.

The proposed legal rule from HCMP 180/2005, which suggests that a contract should be valid and enforceable when there is a common mistake regarding the fundamental quality or title of the subject matter and a mechanism to rectify the mistake, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, particularly in situations where no such rectifying mechanism exists.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that enforcing the contract in the absence of a rectifying mechanism would result in significant unfairness and financial loss to Reah, against the argument that the precedent supports the validity and enforceability of contracts even in the presence of a common mistake.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, equity, and the protection of reasonable expectations in contractual agreements, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the contract between Felicity and Reah should be voidable due to the common mistake regarding the quality and value of the stained glass panel. This decision aligns with the principles of justice and legal consistency, ensuring that parties are not unfairly bound by contracts based on fundamental misapprehensions about the subject matter.

Therefore, Reah should be entitled to rescind the contract and avoid the obligation to proceed with the purchase, as the significant disparity in value due to the mistake about the panel's origin fundamentally alters the nature of the agreement. This outcome ensures fairness and prevents unjust enrichment, maintaining the integrity of contractual dealings.


# Contract Law: Whether Reah can rescind the contract based on the mistake

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 2 and Section 3 Subsection 1 and 2

### Major Premise:

1. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 2

   Conditions:
   - A person has entered into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to him.
   - The misrepresentation has become a term of the contract, or the contract has been performed, or both.
   - He would be entitled to rescind the contract without alleging fraud.

   Conditions:
   - A person has entered into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to him by another party thereto.
   - As a result thereof he has suffered loss.
   - The person making the misrepresentation would be liable to damages in respect thereof had the misrepresentation been made fraudulently.

   Consequences:
   - The person making the misrepresentation shall be liable to damages notwithstanding that the misrepresentation was not made fraudulently.

   Exceptions:
   - The person making the misrepresentation proves that he had reasonable grounds to believe and did believe up to the time the contract was made that the facts represented were true.

3. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - A person has entered into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to him otherwise than fraudulently.
   - He would be entitled, by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract.
   - It is claimed, in any proceedings arising out of the contract, that the contract ought to be or has been rescinded.
   - The court or arbitrator is of opinion that it would be equitable to do so, having regard to the nature of the misrepresentation and the loss that would be caused by it if the contract were upheld, as well as to the loss that rescission would cause to the other party.

   Consequences:
   - The court or arbitrator may declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission.

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 2:
- Reah has entered into a contract with Felicity after a misrepresentation.
- The misrepresentation (that the stained glass panel was Clarky's work) has become a term of the contract.
- Reah would be entitled to rescind the contract without alleging fraud because the misrepresentation was material to her decision to purchase the panel.

2. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1:
- Reah has entered into a contract with Felicity after a misrepresentation made by Felicity.
- Reah has suffered loss as a result of the misrepresentation (the panel is worth significantly less than she paid).
- If Felicity had made the misrepresentation fraudulently, she would be liable to damages.
- Felicity may argue that she had reasonable grounds to believe and did believe up to the time the contract was made that the panel was Clarky's work. However, this would need to be proven.

3. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2:
- Reah has entered into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to her otherwise than fraudulently.
- Reah would be entitled, by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract.
- It is claimed in any proceedings arising out of the contract that the contract ought to be or has been rescinded.
- The court or arbitrator would need to consider whether it would be equitable to declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission, considering the nature of the misrepresentation and the losses involved.

### Conclusion:

Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 2 applies, and Reah shall be entitled to rescind the contract, subject to the provisions of the Ordinance. If Felicity can prove she had reasonable grounds to believe the panel was Clarky's work, then Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1 may not apply. However, if the court finds it equitable, Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2 may allow the court to declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission.

### Relevant law:

Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited

### Major Premise:

1. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited

   Conditions:
   - There is a mutual mistake about whether a written document correctly reflects what the parties had, on an objective assessment, agreed it should contain; or
   - There is a unilateral mistake where one party knows that the other party thinks a term is included or has a mistaken belief about its meaning

   Consequences:
   - The court may rectify the document to reflect the true agreement of the parties

   Exceptions:
   - The court cannot predicate with certainty what the contract was, and that it is, by common mistake, wrongly expressed in the document; or
   - The mistake is not about the terms previously agreed but about the mistaken belief of one of the parties, known to the other, about what the contract said or meant

2. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited

   Conditions:
   - The contract contains a provision which one party knows that the other party thinks is not there, or knows that the other party is mistaken about its meaning; and
   - The mistaken belief is about what the contract said or meant

   Consequences:
   - The court may, as a matter of discretion, either refuse to allow him to enforce the contract as it would ordinarily be construed or
   - Go further and rectify the written agreement to give effect to what the mistaken party thought had been agreed

   Exceptions:
   - The mistaken belief is not known to the other party

### Minor Premise:

1. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited:

   - There is a mutual mistake about whether the written document (the contract of sale) correctly reflects what the parties had, on an objective assessment, agreed it should contain. Reah thought she was buying an original work by Clarky, while Felicity believed she was selling a piece worth £50,000.
   - The court may rectify the document to reflect the true agreement of the parties.
   - However, the court cannot predicate with certainty what the contract was, and that it is, by common mistake, wrongly expressed in the document. The mistake here is about the mistaken belief of Reah, known to Felicity, about what the contract said or meant.

2. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited:

   - The contract contains a provision (the sale of the stained glass panel) which Felicity knows that Reah thinks is an original work by Clarky, or knows that Reah is mistaken about its meaning (its value and origin).
   - The mistaken belief is about what the contract said or meant (Reah believed she was buying an original work worth £50,000).
   - The court may, as a matter of discretion, either refuse to allow Felicity to enforce the contract as it would ordinarily be construed or go further and rectify the written agreement to give effect to what Reah thought had been agreed.
   - The mistaken belief is known to Felicity.

### Conclusion:

Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited applies, and the court may, as a matter of discretion, either refuse to allow Felicity to enforce the contract as it would ordinarily be construed or go further and rectify the written agreement to give effect to what Reah thought had been agreed. Given the circumstances, it is likely that the court would refuse to enforce the contract as it would ordinarily be construed, allowing Reah to rescind the contract based on the mistake.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER)

In the case of LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER [2021] HKCFI 1501; HCA 2593/2017 (precedent p), the plaintiffs alleged fraudulent misrepresentation and repudiatory breach of an Investment Agreement. The court ruled that for a claim of fraudulent misrepresentation to succeed, the representation must be made with knowledge that it is, or may be, false, and must be made with the intention that it should be acted upon by the claimant, resulting in damage to him. The court also emphasized the importance of the credibility of witnesses and the consistency of their evidence with contemporaneous documents.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Misrepresentation**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In the precedent case, the plaintiffs claimed that Mr. Ng made false representations about the status of SSHK and SSZQ, which induced them to enter into the Investment Agreement. In the current case, Reah believed she was purchasing an original work by Clarky, but it turned out to be a piece created by beginner students, which was misrepresented by omission.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Reliance on Representation**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In the precedent case, the plaintiffs relied on the false representation to enter into the Investment Agreement. In the current case, Reah relied on the belief that the piece was an original work by Clarky to agree to the purchase.

- **Legal Concept 3: Intention to Act on Representation**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In the precedent case, the representation was made with the intention that it should be acted upon by the plaintiffs. In the current case, Felicity's acceptance of the offer without clarifying the origin of the piece can be seen as an implicit representation that it was an original work by Clarky.

- **Legal Concept 4: Damage Resulting from Misrepresentation**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In the precedent case, the plaintiffs suffered damage by entering into the Investment Agreement based on the false representation. In the current case, Reah stands to suffer financial loss by paying £50,000 for a piece worth only £5,000.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a misrepresentation made with the intention that it should be acted upon, resulting in reliance and subsequent damage, the court should decide in favor of rescinding the contract. This rule was justified in LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER because the positive effects of protecting parties from fraudulent misrepresentation and ensuring fair dealings in contractual agreements outweigh the negative effects of potentially voiding contracts. 

In Reah's case, the misrepresentation about the origin of the stained glass piece, her reliance on this misrepresentation, and the significant financial damage she would suffer justify the application of this rule. Therefore, Reah should be entitled to rescind the contract based on the doctrine of mistake.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Misrepresentation**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In the precedent case, the plaintiffs claimed that Mr. Ng made false representations about the status of SSHK and SSZQ, which induced them to enter into the Investment Agreement. In the current case, Reah believed she was purchasing an original work by Clarky, but it turned out to be a piece created by beginner students, which was misrepresented by omission.

- **Legal Concept 2: Reliance on Representation**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In the precedent case, the plaintiffs relied on the false representation to enter into the Investment Agreement. In the current case, Reah relied on the belief that the piece was an original work by Clarky to agree to the purchase.

- **Legal Concept 3: Intention to Act on Representation**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In the precedent case, the representation was made with the intention that it should be acted upon by the plaintiffs. In the current case, Felicity's acceptance of the offer without clarifying the origin of the piece can be seen as an implicit representation that it was an original work by Clarky.

- **Legal Concept 4: Damage Resulting from Misrepresentation**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In the precedent case, the plaintiffs suffered damage by entering into the Investment Agreement based on the false representation. In the current case, Reah stands to suffer financial loss by paying £50,000 for a piece worth only £5,000.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome of allowing the contract to be rescinded based on the doctrine of mistake. This decision would be justified because, as in LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Protection from Misrepresentation**: It would protect Reah from the financial loss resulting from a misrepresentation, ensuring that parties are not unfairly disadvantaged by false or misleading information.
2. **Encouragement of Fair Dealings**: It would promote honesty and transparency in contractual dealings, encouraging parties to disclose all relevant information and avoid misleading representations.
3. **Consistency in Legal Principles**: It would maintain consistency in the application of legal principles, reinforcing the precedent that misrepresentation, whether fraudulent or innocent, can render a contract voidable.
4. **Equitable Relief**: It would provide equitable relief to Reah, who acted in good faith based on the belief that she was purchasing an original work by Clarky, thereby upholding the principles of fairness and justice in contractual relationships.

Therefore, the court should allow Reah to rescind the contract based on the doctrine of mistake, as the positive effects of such a decision would outweigh any negative effects, ensuring fair and just outcomes in contractual disputes.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of **fraudulent misrepresentation**. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling (protection from fraudulent misrepresentation and ensuring fair dealings) outweighed any potential drawbacks (voiding a contract). The court found that the misrepresentation was made with knowledge that it was false and with the intention that it should be acted upon by the plaintiffs, resulting in damage to them.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of **fraudulent misrepresentation** is notably absent. There is no evidence to suggest that Felicity knowingly made a false representation about the stained glass piece. Instead, the situation appears to be one of **innocent misrepresentation** or **mutual mistake** regarding the origin and value of the piece. This absence of fraudulent intent significantly weakens the argument for rescinding the contract based on the precedent case.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor of **innocent misrepresentation or mutual mistake** that was not present in **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of misrepresentation. Because of the absence of fraudulent intent and the presence of a mutual mistake about the nature of the stained glass piece, applying the same outcome of rescinding the contract in our case would have more negative consequences, such as undermining the stability of contracts and creating uncertainty in commercial transactions, than positive ones.

In the precedent case, the court's decision to allow rescission was justified by the need to protect parties from fraudulent misrepresentation. However, in our current case, the presence of a mutual mistake without fraudulent intent suggests that a different legal remedy, such as reformation of the contract or compensation for the difference in value, might be more appropriate to balance the interests of both parties and maintain contractual stability.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER** should be stated as 'When both [misrepresentation] and [fraudulent intent] are present, the court should decide [to allow rescission of the contract].' Omitting [fraudulent intent] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of undermining the stability of contracts and creating uncertainty in commercial transactions]. Indeed, the opinion in **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER** explicitly states that [fraudulent intent was crucial to their decision], as the court emphasized the importance of the representation being made with knowledge that it is, or may be, false, and with the intention that it should be acted upon by the claimant, resulting in damage to him.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties being misled by fraudulent misrepresentations and suffering financial damage as a result]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [fraudulent misrepresentation occurring]. The situation involves an innocent misrepresentation or mutual mistake about the nature and value of the stained glass piece, without any fraudulent intent. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, a different legal remedy, such as reformation of the contract or compensation for the difference in value, might be more appropriate to balance the interests of both parties and maintain contractual stability.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of **fraudulent intent**, which was present in the precedent case **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of **misrepresentation** would lead to the undesirable consequence of leaving parties unprotected in situations where they have been misled, albeit innocently, and suffer significant financial loss. Conversely, not requiring **fraudulent intent** would allow for the desirable outcome of providing equitable relief to parties who have been misled, ensuring fairness and justice in contractual relationships. This better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, which aim to protect parties from the adverse effects of misrepresentation and ensure that contracts are based on accurate and honest information.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks **fraudulent intent**, which was present in **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER**, we have the additional factor of **mutual mistake**. This **mutual mistake**, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of **misrepresentation and reliance**, serves a similar function to **fraudulent intent** in the precedent case. Given the presence of **mutual mistake**, we submit that the reasoning in **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER** still applies, as the positive effects on **relevant legal values, such as fairness, justice, and protection from financial loss** would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. Therefore, Reah should be entitled to rescind the contract based on the doctrine of mistake.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of misrepresentation and reliance on that misrepresentation, which led to financial damage. However, it also differs significantly in that the precedent involved fraudulent intent, whereas the current case involves an innocent misrepresentation or mutual mistake.

The proposed legal rule of allowing rescission of the contract when both misrepresentation and fraudulent intent are present finds support in the precedent case. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in cases where fraudulent intent is absent but significant financial loss due to misrepresentation or mutual mistake is evident.

We've weighed arguments from both sides. The initial argument effectively highlights the shared legal concepts and fact patterns, suggesting that rescission should be allowed to protect parties from financial loss due to misrepresentation. The rebuttal arguments correctly point out the absence of fraudulent intent in the current case, which was a crucial factor in the precedent. The surrebuttal arguments emphasize the importance of providing equitable relief even in the absence of fraudulent intent, to ensure fairness and justice in contractual relationships.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, justice, and protection from financial loss, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Reah should be entitled to rescind the contract based on the doctrine of mistake. This decision aligns with the legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency, as it ensures that parties are not unfairly disadvantaged by misrepresentations, whether innocent or fraudulent.

Therefore, Reah can rescind the contract, as the positive effects of providing equitable relief and maintaining fairness in contractual dealings outweigh the potential negative consequences of undermining contractual stability. This approach ensures that the law protects parties from significant financial loss due to misrepresentation, promoting honesty and transparency in contractual relationships.


# Contract Law: Whether Felicity made any representations about the stained glass panel that could constitute misrepresentation

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

   - He has suffered loss as a result of the misrepresentation
   - If the misrepresentation had been made fraudulently, the person making the misrepresentation would be liable to damages

   Consequences:
   - The person making the misrepresentation shall still be liable to damages even though the misrepresentation was not made fraudulently

   Exceptions:
   - The person making the misrepresentation proves that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the facts represented were true
   - The person making the misrepresentation did believe up to the time the contract was made that the facts represented were true

2. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - A person has entered into a contract
   - He entered into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to him
   - The misrepresentation was not made to him fraudulently
   - He would be entitled, by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract
   - It is claimed in any proceedings arising out of the contract that the contract ought to be or has been rescinded
   - The court or arbitrator is of opinion that it would be equitable to do so, having regard to:
     * The nature of the misrepresentation
     * The loss that would be caused by it if the contract were upheld
     * The loss that rescission would cause to the other party

   Consequences:
   - The court or arbitrator may declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1:
- Reah has entered into a contract with Felicity after a misrepresentation.
- The misrepresentation was made to her by Felicity.
- Reah has suffered loss in the form of the difference in value between what she paid (£50,000) and the actual value of the stained glass panel (£5,000).
- If Felicity had made the misrepresentation fraudulently, Felicity would have been liable to damages.
- However, Felicity may argue that she had reasonable grounds to believe the panel was an original work by Clarky and did believe this up to the time the contract was made.
- Therefore, this section may not apply if Felicity can prove her belief was reasonable and genuine.

2. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2:
- Reah has entered into a contract to purchase the stained glass panel.
- Felicity's representation that the panel was an original work by Clarky is a misrepresentation.
- Reah entered into the contract after this misrepresentation was made to her.
- Felicity did not make this misrepresentation fraudulently.
- Reah would be entitled, by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract.
- Reah is claiming that the contract ought to be rescinded.
- The court or arbitrator would consider:
  * The nature of the misrepresentation, which is material as it significantly affects the value of the panel.
  * The loss that would be caused to Reah if the contract were upheld, which is substantial (£45,000).
  * The loss that rescission would cause to Felicity, which may be less significant as she would simply return the £50,000 and take back the panel.

- Therefore, this section applies and the court would likely declare the contract subsisting and award Reah damages in lieu of rescission.

### Conclusion:

Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2 applies, and the court would declare the contract subsisting and award Reah damages, which is the difference between the purchase price (£50,000) and the actual value of the panel (£5,000), in lieu of rescission.

## Deductive Reasoning: cfa

### Relevant law:

Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited

### Major Premise:

1. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited

   Conditions:
   - The contract contains a provision which one party knows that the other party thinks is not there, or knows that the other party is mistaken about its meaning.
   - The mistaken belief is about what the contract said or meant.

   Consequences:
   - The court may, as a matter of discretion, either refuse to allow him to enforce the contract as it would ordinarily be construed or go further and rectify the written agreement to give effect to what the mistaken party thought had been agreed.

   Exceptions:
   - The party resisting rectification is acting in good faith and genuinely believes the document reflects what was agreed.

### Minor Premise:

1. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited:
- The contract between Felicity and Reah involves the sale of a stained glass panel.
- Reah believed she was purchasing an original work by Clarky, but it was actually a piece created by Clarky's evening beginner class students.
- Felicity did not make any representations about the stained glass panel being an original work by Clarky.
- Reah's mistaken belief is about the value and origin of the stained glass panel, not about a specific provision in the contract or its meaning.
- There is no indication that Felicity knew about Reah's mistaken belief regarding the origin and value of the stained glass panel.
- Felicity is acting in good faith and genuinely believes the contract reflects what was agreed upon, which is the sale of the stained glass panel for £50,000.

### Conclusion:

The conditions for the application of the doctrine of mistake as outlined in Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited are not satisfied. Therefore, Reah cannot rely on the doctrine of mistake to avoid proceeding with the contract. Reah must proceed with the contract as agreed.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER)

In the case of LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER [2021] HKCFI 1501; HCA 2593/2017 (precedent p), the plaintiffs alleged fraudulent misrepresentation and repudiatory breach of an Investment Agreement. The court ruled that for a claim of fraudulent misrepresentation to succeed, the representation must be made with knowledge that it is, or may be, false, and must be made with the intention that it should be acted upon by the claimant, resulting in damage to him. The court also emphasized that the burden of proof lies on the person alleging fraud, and the standard of proof is the civil standard but must be strong and cogent.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Representation of Fact**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In the precedent case, Mr. Ng allegedly made representations about the status and operations of SSHK and SSZQ. In the current case, Felicity implicitly represented that the stained glass panel was an original work by Clarky.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Knowledge of Falsity**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** In the precedent case, the representation was alleged to be made with knowledge that it was false. In the current case, Felicity may not have known the true origin of the stained glass panel, but the representation was made without verifying its authenticity.
  
- **Legal Concept 3: Intention to Induce Action**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In the precedent case, the representation was made with the intention that it should be acted upon by the plaintiffs. In the current case, Felicity's representation was made with the intention that Reah would purchase the stained glass panel.
  
- **Legal Concept 4: Resulting Damage**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** In the precedent case, the plaintiffs claimed they suffered damage by entering into the Investment Agreement based on the false representation. In the current case, Reah claims she has suffered damage by agreeing to purchase the panel for £50,000, which is worth only £5,000.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a representation of fact made with knowledge that it is, or may be, false, and with the intention that it should be acted upon by the claimant, resulting in damage to the claimant, the court should decide that the contract is voidable due to fraudulent misrepresentation. This rule was justified in LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER because the positive effects of protecting parties from fraudulent inducement and ensuring fairness in contractual dealings outweigh the negative effects of potentially voiding contracts. 

Applying this rule to the current case, Reah may argue that Felicity's implicit representation about the stained glass panel's authenticity and value, made without verifying its true origin, constitutes a misrepresentation. If Reah can prove that she relied on this representation and suffered damage as a result, she may have grounds to void the contract.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Representation of Fact**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In the precedent case, Mr. Ng allegedly made representations about the status and operations of SSHK and SSZQ. In the current case, Felicity implicitly represented that the stained glass panel was an original work by Clarky.

- **Legal Concept 2: Knowledge of Falsity**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** In the precedent case, the representation was alleged to be made with knowledge that it was false. In the current case, Felicity may not have known the true origin of the stained glass panel, but the representation was made without verifying its authenticity.

- **Legal Concept 3: Intention to Induce Action**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In the precedent case, the representation was made with the intention that it should be acted upon by the plaintiffs. In the current case, Felicity's representation was made with the intention that Reah would purchase the stained glass panel.

- **Legal Concept 4: Resulting Damage**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** In the precedent case, the plaintiffs claimed they suffered damage by entering into the Investment Agreement based on the false representation. In the current case, Reah claims she has suffered damage by agreeing to purchase the panel for £50,000, which is worth only £5,000.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome: that the contract is voidable due to misrepresentation. This decision would be justified because, as in LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Protection from Fraudulent Inducement:** It would protect Reah from being misled into a contract based on a false representation, ensuring that parties are not unfairly induced into agreements.

2. **Ensuring Fairness in Contractual Dealings:** It would uphold the principle that contracts should be based on true and accurate representations, promoting fairness and integrity in commercial transactions.

3. **Encouraging Due Diligence:** It would encourage parties to verify the authenticity and value of items before making representations, thereby reducing the likelihood of similar disputes in the future.

4. **Restitution for Damages:** It would allow Reah to seek restitution for the financial loss she would incur if forced to proceed with the contract, aligning with the principle of compensating parties for damages suffered due to misrepresentation.

Therefore, applying the rule from the precedent case to the current case, the court should find that Reah is entitled to void the contract due to misrepresentation by Felicity. This outcome would uphold the underlying values of fairness, protection from fraud, and integrity in contractual dealings.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the factor of **knowledge of falsity**. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling (protection from fraudulent inducement and ensuring fairness in contractual dealings) outweighed any potential drawbacks because the representation was made with knowledge that it was, or may be, false, and with the intention that it should be acted upon by the claimant, resulting in damage to him. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of **knowledge of falsity** is notably absent as Felicity may not have known the true origin of the stained glass panel and did not intentionally mislead Reah.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor **mistake as to the quality of the subject matter** that was not present in LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the mistake here pertains to the intrinsic quality and value of the stained glass panel, which both parties were unaware of. Due to this mutual mistake, applying the same outcome (voiding the contract due to misrepresentation) in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the principle of caveat emptor (buyer beware) and potentially leading to an increase in litigation over subjective valuations, unlike in LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER where the misrepresentation was intentional and fraudulent.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER** should be stated as: "When both [representation of fact made with knowledge that it is, or may be, false] and [intention to induce action resulting in damage] are present, the court should decide [the contract is voidable due to fraudulent misrepresentation]." Omitting [knowledge of falsity] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q], which is the undermining of the principle of caveat emptor (buyer beware) and an increase in litigation over subjective valuations. Indeed, the opinion in **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER** explicitly states that [knowledge of falsity] was crucial to their decision, as the court emphasized the need for the representation to be made with knowledge that it is, or may be, false, and with the intention that it should be acted upon by the claimant, resulting in damage to him.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties being fraudulently induced into contracts based on false representations made with knowledge of their falsity]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [fraudulent inducement] occurring because Felicity may not have known the true origin of the stained glass panel and did not intentionally mislead Reah. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The current case involves a mutual mistake as to the quality of the subject matter, which is a different issue from fraudulent misrepresentation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of **knowledge of falsity**, which was present in the precedent case **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of **misrepresentation** would lead to the undesirable consequence of allowing parties to escape liability for making false representations simply because they did not verify the truth of their statements. Conversely, not requiring **knowledge of falsity** would allow for the desirable outcome of holding parties accountable for the representations they make, thereby promoting diligence and fairness in contractual dealings. This better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, which aim to protect parties from entering into agreements based on false information, regardless of the representor's knowledge or intent.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks **knowledge of falsity**, which was present in **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER**, we have the additional factor of **mutual mistake as to the quality of the subject matter**. This **mutual mistake**, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of **misrepresentation and resulting damage**, serves a similar function to **knowledge of falsity** in the precedent case. Given the presence of **mutual mistake**, we submit that the reasoning in **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER** still applies, as the positive effects on **fairness and protection from false representations** would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of a representation of fact, the intention to induce action, and resulting damage. However, it also differs significantly in that the precedent involved a representation made with knowledge of its falsity, whereas in the current case, Felicity may not have known the true origin of the stained glass panel.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case—that a contract is voidable due to fraudulent misrepresentation when a representation of fact is made with knowledge that it is, or may be, false, and with the intention that it should be acted upon by the claimant, resulting in damage—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, particularly the principle of caveat emptor (buyer beware) and the potential increase in litigation over subjective valuations.

We've weighed arguments from both sides. A strong point from the initial analogy is that holding parties accountable for the representations they make, regardless of their knowledge or intent, promotes diligence and fairness in contractual dealings. Conversely, a strong point from the rebuttal is that requiring knowledge of falsity for all similar cases of misrepresentation prevents parties from escaping liability for making false representations simply because they did not verify the truth of their statements.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, protection from false representations, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Reah should be entitled to void the contract due to misrepresentation by Felicity. This decision aligns with the precedent's emphasis on protecting parties from entering into agreements based on false information, even if the representor did not have knowledge of the falsity. The presence of mutual mistake as to the quality of the subject matter serves a similar function to knowledge of falsity in ensuring that the positive effects on fairness and protection from false representations outweigh any potential negative consequences.

Therefore, Reah is entitled to void the contract and seek restitution for the financial loss she would incur if forced to proceed with the purchase. This outcome upholds the principles of fairness, diligence, and integrity in contractual dealings.

### Minor Premise:

1. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 2:
- Reah has entered into a contract with Felicity after a misrepresentation has been made to her.
- The misrepresentation has become a term of the contract (the stained glass panel being Clarky's work).
- The contract has been performed (Reah has agreed to pay £50,000).
- Reah would be entitled to rescind the contract without alleging fraud.
- Therefore, Reah shall be entitled to rescind the contract, subject to the provisions of this Ordinance.

2. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1:
- Reah has entered into a contract with Felicity after a misrepresentation.
- The misrepresentation was made to her by Felicity.
- Reah has suffered loss as a result of the misrepresentation (the panel is worth only £5,000 instead of £50,000).
- If the misrepresentation had been made fraudulently, Felicity would be liable to damages.
- Felicity may argue that she had reasonable grounds to believe that the facts represented were true and did believe up to the time the contract was made that the facts represented were true.
- Therefore, this section may not apply if Felicity can prove her belief was reasonable and genuine.

3. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2:
- Reah has entered into a contract of sale of the stained glass panel.
- Felicity claiming the panel is Clarky's work is a misrepresentation.
- Reah has entered into the contract after this misrepresentation has been made to her.
- Felicity did not make this misrepresentation fraudulently.
- Reah would be entitled, by reason of misrepresentation, to rescind the contract.
- It is claimed in any proceedings arising out of the contract that the contract ought to be or has been rescinded.
- Balancing the nature of the misrepresentation,
  * it is an innocent misrepresentation but it is material and affects the value of the panel;
  * the loss that would be suffered by Reah if the contract was upheld is significant (£45,000 difference in value);
  * the loss to Felicity if rescission is granted would be the return of the panel and the loss of the sale.
- Therefore, this section applies and the court may declare the contract subsisting and award Reah damages in lieu of rescission.

### Conclusion:

Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 2 and Section 3 Subsection 2 apply. Reah is entitled to rescind the contract under Section 2. Alternatively, under Section 3 Subsection 2, the court may declare the contract subsisting and award Reah damages in lieu of rescission.

### Relevant law:

Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited

### Major Premise:

1. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited

   Conditions:
   - There is a mutual or common mistake about whether a written document correctly reflects what the parties had, on an objective assessment, agreed it should contain; or
   - There is a unilateral mistake where one party knows that the other party thinks a term is included or has a mistaken belief about its meaning

   Consequences:
   - The court may rectify the document to reflect the true agreement of the parties

   Exceptions:
   - The mistake is not about the terms previously agreed; or
   - The court cannot predicate with certainty what the contract was

### Minor Premise:

1. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited:
- Reah and Felicity have entered into a contract for the sale of a stained glass panel.
- Reah believed she was purchasing an original work by Clarky, but it was actually a piece created by Clarky's evening beginner class students.
- This constitutes a unilateral mistake where Reah had a mistaken belief about the nature and value of the stained glass panel.
- Felicity did not know that Reah had this mistaken belief about the panel's origin and value.
- The mistake is about the nature and value of the item, not the terms previously agreed upon in the contract.
- The court cannot predicate with certainty what the contract was supposed to be, as the mistake pertains to the value and origin of the item, not the terms of the agreement.

### Conclusion:

The doctrine of mistake as outlined in Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited does not apply to this scenario because the mistake is about the nature and value of the item, not the terms previously agreed upon in the contract. Therefore, Reah is bound by the contract and must proceed with the purchase.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER)

In the case of LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER [2021] HKCFI 1501; HCA 2593/2017 (precedent p), the plaintiffs alleged fraudulent misrepresentation and repudiatory breach of an Investment Agreement. The court ruled that for a claim of fraudulent misrepresentation to succeed, the representation must be made with knowledge that it is, or may be, false, and must be made with the intention that it should be acted upon by the claimant, resulting in damage to him. The court also emphasized the importance of the credibility of witnesses and the consistency of their evidence with contemporaneous documents.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Representation of Fact**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In the precedent case, Mr. Ng allegedly made a representation about the status of SSHK and SSZQ, claiming they had no business operations, assets, or liabilities. In the current case, Felicity implicitly represented that the stained glass panel was an original work by Clarky, given its context and the price agreed upon.

- **Legal Concept 2: Knowledge of Falsity**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** In the precedent case, the representation was alleged to be made with knowledge that it was false. In the current case, it is unclear whether Felicity knew the true origin of the stained glass panel, but the principle remains that a misrepresentation must be made with knowledge of its falsity or recklessly.

- **Legal Concept 3: Inducement and Reliance**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In the precedent case, the plaintiffs claimed they relied on the false representation to enter into the Investment Agreement. In the current case, Reah relied on the implicit representation that the stained glass panel was an original work by Clarky when she agreed to purchase it for £50,000.

- **Legal Concept 4: Resulting Damage**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** In the precedent case, the plaintiffs needed to show that they suffered damage as a result of the misrepresentation. In the current case, Reah would suffer financial damage by paying £50,000 for a piece worth only £5,000.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a representation of fact made with knowledge of its falsity or recklessly, intended to induce reliance, and resulting in damage, the court should decide in favor of the claimant for relief from the contract. This rule was justified in LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER because the positive effects (E+) of protecting parties from fraudulent misrepresentation and ensuring fair dealings in contractual relationships outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially voiding contracts and creating uncertainty in commercial transactions.

Applying this rule to the current case, if it can be established that Felicity made an implicit representation about the stained glass panel's origin, and Reah relied on this representation to her detriment, Reah should be entitled to relief from the contract. This would align with the principles of fairness and protection against misrepresentation upheld in the precedent case.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Representation of Fact**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In the precedent case, Mr. Ng allegedly made a representation about the status of SSHK and SSZQ, claiming they had no business operations, assets, or liabilities. In the current case, Felicity implicitly represented that the stained glass panel was an original work by Clarky, given its context and the price agreed upon.

- **Legal Concept 2: Knowledge of Falsity**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** In the precedent case, the representation was alleged to be made with knowledge that it was false. In the current case, it is unclear whether Felicity knew the true origin of the stained glass panel, but the principle remains that a misrepresentation must be made with knowledge of its falsity or recklessly.

- **Legal Concept 3: Inducement and Reliance**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In the precedent case, the plaintiffs claimed they relied on the false representation to enter into the Investment Agreement. In the current case, Reah relied on the implicit representation that the stained glass panel was an original work by Clarky when she agreed to purchase it for £50,000.

- **Legal Concept 4: Resulting Damage**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** In the precedent case, the plaintiffs needed to show that they suffered damage as a result of the misrepresentation. In the current case, Reah would suffer financial damage by paying £50,000 for a piece worth only £5,000.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in the precedent case. This decision would be justified because, as in LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Protection Against Misrepresentation:** Upholding Reah's claim would reinforce the principle that parties should not be misled into contracts based on false representations, whether explicit or implicit. This aligns with the underlying value of fairness in contractual dealings.

2. **Encouragement of Due Diligence:** While it is important for buyers to conduct due diligence, sellers must also ensure that they do not misrepresent the nature of what they are selling. This decision would encourage both parties to be more diligent and transparent, promoting trust in commercial transactions.

3. **Deterrence of Fraudulent Behavior:** By providing relief to Reah, the court would send a strong message that fraudulent misrepresentation, even if not intentional, will not be tolerated. This would deter similar behavior in the future, contributing to a more honest marketplace.

4. **Equitable Relief:** Given the significant financial disparity between the represented value (£50,000) and the actual value (£5,000) of the stained glass panel, it would be equitable to allow Reah to rescind the contract. This would prevent unjust enrichment of Felicity at Reah's expense.

Therefore, applying the rule from the precedent case to the current case, Reah should be entitled to relief from the contract due to the misrepresentation about the stained glass panel's origin and value. This decision would uphold the principles of fairness, transparency, and deterrence of fraudulent behavior in contractual relationships.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of **contemporaneous written records** and **documentary evidence**. These records were key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as **protection against fraudulent misrepresentation** and **encouragement of due diligence**, outweighed any potential drawbacks, such as **voiding contracts and creating uncertainty in commercial transactions**. The contemporaneous documents provided a clear and objective basis for assessing the credibility of the representations made and the reliance placed on them.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of **contemporaneous written records** is notably absent. The transaction between Felicity and Reah appears to have been based on an **oral agreement** and **implicit representations** without any written documentation to substantiate the claims about the stained glass panel's origin and value. This absence of documentary evidence makes it more challenging to objectively assess whether there was a misrepresentation and whether Reah's reliance on it was justified.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor **(the valuation by a specialist)** that was not present in **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the specialist's valuation provides an **objective assessment** of the stained glass panel's worth, which directly contradicts the implicit representation made by Felicity.

Due to the presence of the specialist's valuation, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as **undermining the reliability of expert valuations** and **potentially encouraging parties to disregard professional assessments**, unlike in **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER**. The specialist's valuation introduces a level of objectivity and expertise that was not present in the precedent case, thereby altering the balance of positive and negative effects. This factor suggests that Reah has a stronger basis for claiming relief from the contract due to the clear discrepancy between the represented and actual value of the stained glass panel.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER** should be stated as: "When both [a representation of fact made with knowledge of its falsity or recklessly, intended to induce reliance, and resulting in damage] and [the presence of contemporaneous written records or documentary evidence] are present, the court should decide [in favor of the claimant for relief from the contract]." Omitting [the presence of contemporaneous written records or documentary evidence] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q], such as undermining the reliability of oral agreements and increasing the potential for fraudulent claims without objective evidence. Indeed, the opinion in **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER** explicitly states that [the presence of contemporaneous written records] was crucial to their decision, as it provided a clear and objective basis for assessing the credibility of the representations made and the reliance placed on them.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of fraudulent claims being made without objective evidence, leading to unjust voiding of contracts and commercial uncertainty]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [this specific undesirable consequence] occurring because the presence of the specialist's valuation provides an objective assessment of the stained glass panel's worth, which directly contradicts the implicit representation made by Felicity. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should consider the objective valuation provided by the specialist, which serves as a reliable basis for determining the true value of the stained glass panel and the validity of Reah's claim for relief from the contract.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the contemporaneous written records or documentary evidence, which was present in the precedent case **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of fraudulent misrepresentation would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would undermine the ability of courts to provide relief in cases where misrepresentations are made orally or implicitly, which are common in everyday transactions. Conversely, not requiring contemporaneous written records would allow for a more flexible and equitable approach, ensuring that parties who have been misled by false representations can still seek justice. This better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and protection against misrepresentation in contract law.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the contemporaneous written records or documentary evidence, which was present in **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER**, we have the additional factor of the specialist's valuation. This specialist's valuation, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of the misrepresentation and reliance, serves a similar function to the contemporaneous written records in the precedent case. Given the presence of the specialist's valuation, we submit that the reasoning in **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER** still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as fairness, transparency, and deterrence of fraudulent behavior would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations:

**Key Similarities:**
1. **Representation of Fact:** Both cases involve representations about the nature and status of an asset (SSHK and SSZQ in the precedent case, and the stained glass panel in the current case).
2. **Inducement and Reliance:** In both cases, the claimants relied on these representations to their detriment.
3. **Resulting Damage:** Both cases involve financial damage resulting from the reliance on the misrepresentation.

**Key Differences:**
1. **Contemporaneous Written Records:** The precedent case had contemporaneous written records and documentary evidence, which were crucial in assessing the credibility of the representations. The current case lacks such documentation.
2. **Specialist Valuation:** The current case includes a specialist's valuation, which provides an objective assessment of the stained glass panel's worth, a factor not present in the precedent case.

**Proposed Legal Rule:**
The rule from the precedent case suggests that when a representation of fact is made with knowledge of its falsity or recklessly, intended to induce reliance, and resulting in damage, the court should decide in favor of the claimant for relief from the contract. This rule is supported by the need to protect parties from fraudulent misrepresentation and ensure fair dealings in contractual relationships.

**Weighing Arguments:**
- **For Reah:** The presence of the specialist's valuation serves a similar function to the contemporaneous written records in the precedent case, providing an objective basis for assessing the misrepresentation. This supports Reah's claim for relief from the contract.
- **Against Reah:** The lack of contemporaneous written records makes it more challenging to objectively assess whether there was a misrepresentation and whether Reah's reliance on it was justified.

**Relevant Legal Principles:**
- **Fairness and Protection Against Misrepresentation:** Ensuring that parties are not misled into contracts based on false representations.
- **Encouragement of Due Diligence:** Promoting transparency and diligence in commercial transactions.
- **Deterrence of Fraudulent Behavior:** Sending a strong message that fraudulent misrepresentation will not be tolerated.

**Final Decision:**
Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, transparency, and deterrence of fraudulent behavior, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Reah should be entitled to relief from the contract. The specialist's valuation provides a reliable and objective basis for determining the true value of the stained glass panel and the validity of Reah's claim. This decision aligns with the principles upheld in **LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER**, while also addressing the unique circumstances of the current case.

Therefore, Reah does not have to proceed with the contract, as she has not bought what she thought she was buying, and the misrepresentation about the stained glass panel's origin and value justifies rescinding the contract.

### Major Premise:

1. Limitation Ordinance Cap. 347 Section 26 Subsection 1 and 4

   Conditions:
   - A person has entered into a contract.
   - The action is for relief from the consequences of a mistake.
   - The period of limitation has not begun to run until the plaintiff has discovered the mistake or could with reasonable diligence have discovered it.

   Consequences:
   - The period of limitation shall not begin to run until the plaintiff has discovered the mistake or could with reasonable diligence have discovered it.

   Exceptions:
   - The action is to recover, or recover the value of, any property.
   - The action is to enforce any charge against, or set aside any transaction affecting, any property, to be brought against the purchaser of the property or any person claiming through him in any case where the property has been purchased for valuable consideration by an innocent third party since the transaction in which the mistake was made took place.

2. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 2

   Conditions:
   - A person has entered into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to him.
   - The misrepresentation has become a term of the contract.
   - The contract has been performed, or both.
   - He would be entitled to rescind the contract without alleging fraud.

   Consequences:
   - He shall be so entitled, subject to the provisions of this Ordinance, notwithstanding the matters mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (b).

   Exceptions:
   - None.

### Minor Premise:

1. Limitation Ordinance Cap. 347 Section 26 Subsection 1 and 4:
- Reah has entered into a contract with Felicity.
- Reah seeks relief from the consequences of a mistake regarding the value and authenticity of the stained glass panel.
- The period of limitation has not begun to run until Reah discovered the mistake through the specialist valuer.

   However, the exceptions apply:
   - The action is to recover, or recover the value of, the stained glass panel.
   - The action is to set aside the transaction affecting the stained glass panel, which was purchased for valuable consideration by Reah, an innocent third party.

   Therefore, this section does not apply.

2. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 2:
- Reah has entered into a contract with Felicity after a misrepresentation regarding the stained glass panel's value and authenticity.
- The misrepresentation has become a term of the contract as Reah believed she was purchasing an original work by Clarky.
- The contract has been performed as Reah has agreed to pay £50,000 for the piece.
- Reah would be entitled to rescind the contract without alleging fraud, as the misrepresentation was material to her decision to purchase the panel.

   Therefore, this section applies.

### Conclusion:

Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 2 applies, and Reah would be entitled to rescind the contract with Felicity due to the misrepresentation regarding the stained glass panel's value and authenticity. Reah does not have a duty to verify the authenticity and value of the stained glass panel before entering into the contract, as the misrepresentation made by Felicity entitles her to rescind the contract.

   - The court may rectify the document to reflect the true agreement of the parties; or
   - The court may refuse to enforce the contract as it would ordinarily be construed or rectify the written agreement to give effect to what the mistaken party thought had been agreed

   Exceptions:
   - The court cannot predicate with certainty what the contract was, and that it is, by common mistake, wrongly expressed in the document; or
   - The mistake is not about the terms previously agreed but about the mistaken belief of one of the parties, known to the other, about what the contract said or meant

2. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited

   Conditions:
   - The parties have made an agreement including a term which the document has mistakenly left out; or
   - One party knew both that the term had been omitted and that the other party thought it had been included

   Consequences:
   - The court may rectify the written agreement to give effect to what the mistaken party thought had been agreed

   Exceptions:
   - The mistake is not about whether the document correctly reflects the terms previously agreed; or
   - The mistake is not about the mistaken belief of one of the parties, known to the other, about what the contract said or meant

3. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited

   Conditions:
   - The parties have made an agreement including a term which the document has mistakenly left out; or
   - One party knows that the other party thinks a term is included or has a mistaken belief about the meaning of the contract

   Consequences:
   - The court may rectify the document to reflect the true agreement or
   - Refuse to allow the party to enforce the contract as it would ordinarily be construed

   Exceptions:
   - The mistake is not about whether the document correctly reflects the terms previously agreed; or
   - The mistaken belief is not known to the other party

### Minor Premise:

1. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited:
- Reah and Felicity have made an agreement for the sale of a stained glass panel.
- Reah believed she was purchasing an original work by Clarky, but it was actually a piece created by Clarky's students.
- Felicity did not know that Reah had this mistaken belief about the origin of the panel.
- The mistake is about the value and origin of the panel, not about the terms previously agreed or the document reflecting those terms.

2. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited:
- The agreement did not mistakenly leave out a term.
- Felicity did not know that Reah thought the panel was an original work by Clarky.
- The mistake is about the value and origin of the panel, not about the terms previously agreed or the document reflecting those terms.

3. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited:
- The agreement did not mistakenly leave out a term.
- Felicity did not know that Reah thought the panel was an original work by Clarky.
- The mistake is about the value and origin of the panel, not about the terms previously agreed or the document reflecting those terms.

### Conclusion:

The doctrine of mistake as outlined in Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited does not apply to Reah's situation because the mistake is about the value and origin of the stained glass panel, not about the terms previously agreed or the document reflecting those terms. Therefore, Reah has a duty to verify the authenticity and value of the stained glass panel before entering into the contract, and she must proceed with the contract.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCMP 180/2005)
In the case of HCMP 180/2005 BETWEEN TONY INVESTMENTS LIMITED (德隆投資有限公司) Plaintiff and FUNG SUN KWAN BERNARD(馮燊均) (alias FUNG SUN KWAN) trading as KWONG YEE WOO (SHIPBUILDING CONTRACTORS) Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the Vendor had no title to the Former Slipway and that the Purchaser's requisitions for a re-grant were reasonable. The court found that the Vendor had failed to show good title and that the Purchaser was entitled to specific performance, provided the Vendor obtained the necessary re-grant from the Government.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCMP 180/2005 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Common Mistake**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCMP 180/2005, both parties were under a common misapprehension regarding the Vendor's title to the Former Slipway. In our current case, both Reah and Felicity were under a common misapprehension regarding the authenticity and value of the stained glass panel.

- **Legal Concept 2: Implied Warranty of Title**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Vendor implicitly warranted that he had good title to the property being sold. In our current case, Felicity implicitly warranted that the stained glass panel was an original work by Clarky.

- **Legal Concept 3: Reasonableness of Requisitions**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Purchaser's requisitions for a re-grant were deemed reasonable. In our current case, Reah's expectation that the stained glass panel was an original work by Clarky and her subsequent actions to insure it were reasonable based on the information provided.

- **Legal Concept 4: Specific Performance and Damages**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCMP 180/2005, the court considered specific performance as an appropriate remedy but also acknowledged the possibility of damages. In our current case, Reah may seek to avoid the contract or claim damages due to the misapprehension about the stained glass panel's authenticity and value.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCMP 180/2005)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a common misapprehension regarding a fundamental aspect of the contract (fact pattern i*), the court should decide that the contract may be void or subject to rescission (outcome o). This rule was justified in HCMP 180/2005 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that parties are not bound by contracts based on fundamental mistakes outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially voiding contracts, thereby upholding the principles of fairness and equity in contractual dealings.

In Reah's case, the common misapprehension about the stained glass panel's authenticity and value is a fundamental aspect of the contract. Therefore, applying the rule from HCMP 180/2005, Reah should be entitled to avoid the contract or seek rescission, as the mistake makes the contract essentially different from what the parties contemplated.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCMP 180/2005) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Common Mistake**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCMP 180/2005, both parties were under a common misapprehension regarding the Vendor's title to the Former Slipway. In our current case, both Reah and Felicity were under a common misapprehension regarding the authenticity and value of the stained glass panel.

- **Legal Concept 2: Implied Warranty of Title**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Vendor implicitly warranted that he had good title to the property being sold. In our current case, Felicity implicitly warranted that the stained glass panel was an original work by Clarky.

- **Legal Concept 3: Reasonableness of Requisitions**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Purchaser's requisitions for a re-grant were deemed reasonable. In our current case, Reah's expectation that the stained glass panel was an original work by Clarky and her subsequent actions to insure it were reasonable based on the information provided.

- **Legal Concept 4: Specific Performance and Damages**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCMP 180/2005, the court considered specific performance as an appropriate remedy but also acknowledged the possibility of damages. In our current case, Reah may seek to avoid the contract or claim damages due to the misapprehension about the stained glass panel's authenticity and value.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome: the contract may be void or subject to rescission due to the common mistake. This decision would be justified because, as in HCMP 180/2005, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Fairness and Equity**: Ensuring that parties are not bound by contracts based on fundamental mistakes promotes fairness and equity in contractual dealings. Reah entered into the contract under the belief that she was purchasing an original work by Clarky, which significantly influenced her decision and the price she was willing to pay.

2. **Encouraging Due Diligence**: While parties should exercise due diligence, the law should also protect them from being unfairly bound by contracts when both parties share a fundamental misapprehension. This encourages transparency and honesty in transactions.

3. **Preventing Unjust Enrichment**: Allowing Reah to rescind the contract prevents Felicity from being unjustly enriched by receiving a significantly higher price for a piece that is not what it was represented to be.

4. **Maintaining Market Integrity**: Ensuring that transactions are based on accurate representations helps maintain the integrity of the market, particularly in the art world where authenticity and provenance are crucial.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCMP 180/2005, it would have the positive effects of upholding fairness and equity, encouraging due diligence, preventing unjust enrichment, and maintaining market integrity.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCMP 180/2005, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the Vendor had a contractual right against the Government to seek a re-grant of the Former Slipway at a nominal premium. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling (upholding the contract and requiring the Vendor to obtain the re-grant) outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided a clear and feasible path for the Vendor to fulfill his contractual obligations, thereby maintaining the integrity of the contractual agreement and ensuring fairness to the Purchaser.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent. Felicity does not have any similar contractual right or guarantee that would allow her to rectify the misapprehension about the stained glass panel's authenticity and value. There is no mechanism in place that would enable Felicity to transform the panel into an original work by Clarky or to otherwise meet Reah's expectations. This absence of a clear and feasible path to rectify the mistake significantly alters the balance of positive and negative effects, making it more challenging to justify upholding the contract under the same principles applied in HCMP 180/2005.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in HCMP 180/2005: the significant disparity in the value of the stained glass panel based on its authenticity. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of common misapprehension. In HCMP 180/2005, the issue was primarily about the legal title to the property, which could be resolved through a re-grant. However, in our current case, the misapprehension directly affects the intrinsic value of the item being sold, with a difference of £45,000 between the believed value and the actual value.

Due to this significant disparity in value, applying the same outcome (upholding the contract) in our case would have more negative consequences, such as unjust enrichment of Felicity and substantial financial loss to Reah, than positive ones. Unlike in HCMP 180/2005, where the Vendor had a clear path to rectify the title issue, there is no equivalent remedy available to address the fundamental mistake about the stained glass panel's authenticity and value. This makes it more equitable to allow Reah to avoid the contract or seek rescission, thereby preventing an unfair outcome.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from HCMP 180/2005 should be stated as: "When both a common misapprehension regarding a fundamental aspect of the contract (i*) and a clear and feasible path to rectify the mistake (m) are present, the court should decide that the contract may be void or subject to rescission (o)." Omitting the clear and feasible path to rectify the mistake (m) from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence (q) of binding parties to contracts that are fundamentally different from what they contemplated, without any practical means to rectify the situation. Indeed, the opinion in HCMP 180/2005 explicitly states that the Vendor's contractual right to seek a re-grant from the Government was crucial to their decision, as it provided a clear mechanism to resolve the title issue and fulfill the contractual obligations.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in HCMP 180/2005 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence (u) of parties being unfairly bound by contracts based on fundamental mistakes, while ensuring that there is a practical means to rectify the mistake. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence occurring because Felicity does not have any similar contractual right or guarantee that would allow her to rectify the misapprehension about the stained glass panel's authenticity and value. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—ensuring fairness while providing a practical means to rectify the mistake—is not relevant to our situation. Instead, allowing Reah to avoid the contract or seek rescission would better serve the principles of fairness and equity, given the significant disparity in value and the absence of any feasible path to rectify the mistake.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of a clear and feasible path to rectify the mistake (m), which was present in the precedent case HCMP 180/2005, requiring this factor for all similar cases of common misapprehension regarding a fundamental aspect of the contract (fact pattern i*) would lead to the undesirable consequence of binding parties to contracts that are fundamentally different from what they contemplated, without any practical means to rectify the situation. Conversely, not requiring the clear and feasible path to rectify the mistake (m) would allow for the desirable outcome of ensuring fairness and equity in contractual dealings. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which aim to prevent unjust enrichment and ensure that parties are not unfairly bound by contracts based on fundamental mistakes.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of a clear and feasible path to rectify the mistake (m), which was present in HCMP 180/2005, we have the additional factor of a significant disparity in the value of the stained glass panel based on its authenticity (n). This significant disparity in value, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of common misapprehension regarding a fundamental aspect of the contract (i*), serves a similar function to the clear and feasible path to rectify the mistake (m) in the precedent case. Given the presence of this significant disparity in value (n), we submit that the reasoning in HCMP 180/2005 still applies, as the positive effects on fairness, equity, and preventing unjust enrichment would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCMP 180/2005, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of a common misapprehension regarding a fundamental aspect of the contract and the implied warranty of title. However, it also differs significantly in that the precedent involved a clear and feasible path to rectify the mistake (the re-grant from the Government), whereas our current case lacks such a mechanism.

The proposed legal rule from HCMP 180/2005, which allows for the contract to be void or subject to rescission in the presence of a common misapprehension and a clear path to rectify the mistake, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in situations where no such rectification mechanism exists.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the absence of a clear and feasible path to rectify the mistake in our current case makes it more equitable to allow Reah to avoid the contract or seek rescission. Conversely, the argument that the significant disparity in value serves a similar function to the rectification mechanism in the precedent case is also compelling.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, equity, and preventing unjust enrichment, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Reah should be entitled to avoid the contract or seek rescission. This decision aligns with the principles of ensuring that parties are not unfairly bound by contracts based on fundamental mistakes and preventing unjust enrichment, especially given the significant disparity in value and the absence of any feasible path to rectify the mistake.

Therefore, Reah does not have to proceed with the contract, as the common misapprehension regarding the authenticity and value of the stained glass panel makes the contract fundamentally different from what the parties contemplated. This conclusion serves justice and legal consistency by upholding the principles of fairness and equity in contractual dealings.

### Major Premise:

1. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 2

   Conditions:
   - A person has entered into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to him.
   - The misrepresentation has become a term of the contract, or the contract has been performed, or both.
   - He would be entitled to rescind the contract without alleging fraud.

   - If the person making the misrepresentation would be liable to damages in respect thereof had the misrepresentation been made fraudulently.

   Consequences:
   - The person making the misrepresentation shall be liable to damages notwithstanding that the misrepresentation was not made fraudulently.

   Exceptions:
   - The person making the misrepresentation proves that he had reasonable grounds to believe and did believe up to the time the contract was made that the facts represented were true.

3. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - A person has entered into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to him otherwise than fraudulently.
   - He would be entitled, by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract.
   - It is claimed, in any proceedings arising out of the contract, that the contract ought to be or has been rescinded.
   - The court or arbitrator is of opinion that it would be equitable to do so, having regard to the nature of the misrepresentation and the loss that would be caused by it if the contract were upheld, as well as to the loss that rescission would cause to the other party.

   Consequences:
   - The court or arbitrator may declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission.

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 2:
- Reah has entered into a contract with Felicity after a misrepresentation.
- The misrepresentation (that the piece was Clarky's work) has become a term of the contract.
- Reah would be entitled to rescind the contract without alleging fraud.
- Therefore, Reah is entitled to rescind the contract, subject to the provisions of the Ordinance.

2. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1:
- Reah has entered into a contract with Felicity after a misrepresentation has been made to her by Felicity.
- As a result, Reah has suffered loss (the piece is worth significantly less than she paid).
- If Felicity had made the misrepresentation fraudulently, she would be liable to damages.
- However, Felicity may argue that she had reasonable grounds to believe and did believe up to the time the contract was made that the piece was Clarky's work.
- Therefore, this section may not apply if Felicity can prove her belief was reasonable.

3. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2:
- Reah has entered into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to her otherwise than fraudulently.
- Reah would be entitled, by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract.
- It is claimed in any proceedings arising out of the contract that the contract ought to be or has been rescinded.
- The court or arbitrator would consider it equitable to declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission, having regard to:
  * The nature of the misrepresentation (innocent but material).
  * The loss that would be caused by it if the contract were upheld (Reah overpaying significantly).
  * The loss that rescission would cause to Felicity (potentially having to return the money and take back the piece).

### Conclusion:

Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 2 applies, and Reah is entitled to rescind the contract. If Felicity can prove she had reasonable grounds to believe the piece was Clarky's work, Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1 may not apply. However, Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2 also applies, and the court may declare the contract subsisting and award Reah damages in lieu of rescission.

Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited

### Major Premise:

1. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited

   Conditions:
   - There is a mutual or unilateral mistake about whether a written document correctly reflects what the parties had, on an objective assessment, agreed it should contain.
   - The mistake is about the terms previously agreed or the mistaken belief of one of the parties, known to the other, about what the contract said or meant.

   Consequences:
   - The court may rectify the document to reflect the true agreement of the parties.

   Exceptions:
   - The court cannot predicate with certainty what the contract was, and that it is, by common mistake, wrongly expressed in the document.

2. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited

   Conditions:
   - The contract contains a provision which one party knows that the other party thinks is not there, or knows that the other party is mistaken about its meaning.
   - The mistaken belief is about what the contract said or meant.

   Consequences:
   - The court may, as a matter of discretion, either refuse to allow him to enforce the contract as it would ordinarily be construed or go further and rectify the written agreement to give effect to what the mistaken party thought had been agreed.

   Exceptions:
   - The court does not find sufficient evidence to justify rectification for unilateral mistake.

### Minor Premise:

1. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited (First Condition Set):
- There is a mutual mistake about whether the written document (the contract for the sale of the stained glass panel) correctly reflects what the parties had agreed it should contain.
- The mistake is about the terms previously agreed or the mistaken belief of one of the parties (Reah), known to the other (Felicity), about what the contract said or meant.
- Therefore, the court may rectify the document to reflect the true agreement of the parties.
- However, the court cannot predicate with certainty what the contract was, and that it is, by common mistake, wrongly expressed in the document. This exception does not apply as the mistake is clear and identifiable.

2. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited (Second Condition Set):
- The contract contains a provision (the sale of the stained glass panel for £50,000) which one party (Felicity) knows that the other party (Reah) thinks is not there, or knows that the other party is mistaken about its meaning.
- The mistaken belief is about what the contract said or meant (Reah believed she was buying an original work by Clarky worth £50,000, but it was actually a student piece worth £5,000).
- Therefore, the court may, as a matter of discretion, either refuse to allow Felicity to enforce the contract as it would ordinarily be construed or go further and rectify the written agreement to give effect to what Reah thought had been agreed.
- The court does not find sufficient evidence to justify rectification for unilateral mistake. This exception does not apply as there is sufficient evidence of the mistake.

### Conclusion:

Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited applies, and the court may rectify the contract to reflect the true agreement of the parties, which is that Reah thought she was purchasing an original work by Clarky worth £50,000. Alternatively, the court may refuse to allow Felicity to enforce the contract as it would ordinarily be construed.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCMP 180/2005)
In the case of HCMP 180/2005 BETWEEN TONY INVESTMENTS LIMITED (德隆投資有限公司) Plaintiff and FUNG SUN KWAN BERNARD(馮燊均) (alias FUNG SUN KWAN) trading as KWONG YEE WOO (SHIPBUILDING CONTRACTORS) Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the Vendor had no title to the Former Slipway and that the Purchaser's requisitions were reasonable. The Vendor failed to show good title, and the Purchaser was entitled to specific performance or damages. The court also rejected the defence of common mistake, holding that the Vendor's belief about his rights did not void the contract.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCMP 180/2005 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Good Title**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Vendor was required to show good title to the property being sold. Similarly, in our current case, Felicity must have good title to the stained glass panel she is selling to Reah.
- **Legal Concept 2: Misapprehension of Rights**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Vendor had a mistaken belief about his rights over the Former Slipway. In our current case, Reah has a mistaken belief about the value and origin of the stained glass panel.
- **Legal Concept 3: Common Mistake**: In HCMP 180/2005, the court considered whether a common mistake about the Vendor's rights could void the contract. In our current case, Reah's mistaken belief about the stained glass panel's value and origin could be seen as a common mistake.
- **Legal Concept 4: Specific Performance and Damages**: In HCMP 180/2005, the court considered whether specific performance or damages were appropriate remedies. In our current case, Reah may seek to avoid the contract or claim damages due to the mistake.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCMP 180/2005)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a common mistake about the subject matter or rights involved in a contract, the court should decide whether the mistake is fundamental enough to void the contract or whether specific performance or damages are appropriate remedies. This rule was justified in HCMP 180/2005 because the court found that the Vendor's mistaken belief about his rights did not void the contract, and the Purchaser was entitled to specific performance or damages. The positive effects (E+) of this outcome include upholding the integrity of contractual agreements and ensuring that parties cannot easily escape their obligations due to mistaken beliefs. The negative effects (E-) are minimal in comparison, as the court can still provide equitable remedies such as damages to address any unfairness.

Applying this rule to our current case, Reah's mistaken belief about the value and origin of the stained glass panel does not automatically void the contract. The court would likely consider whether the mistake is fundamental enough to warrant voiding the contract or whether Reah should seek damages. Given the precedent, it is likely that the court would uphold the contract and require Reah to proceed with the purchase, possibly allowing her to seek damages if she can prove that Felicity misrepresented the panel's value or origin.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCMP 180/2005) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Good Title**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Vendor was required to show good title to the property being sold. Similarly, in our current case, Felicity must have good title to the stained glass panel she is selling to Reah. However, the issue here is not about the title but the value and origin of the artwork.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Misapprehension of Rights**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Vendor had a mistaken belief about his rights over the Former Slipway. In our current case, Reah has a mistaken belief about the value and origin of the stained glass panel, thinking it was an original work by Clarky when it was actually a piece created by his students.

- **Legal Concept 3: Common Mistake**: In HCMP 180/2005, the court considered whether a common mistake about the Vendor's rights could void the contract. In our current case, Reah's mistaken belief about the stained glass panel's value and origin could be seen as a common mistake. Both parties believed the panel was an original work by Clarky, which significantly affects its value.

- **Legal Concept 4: Specific Performance and Damages**: In HCMP 180/2005, the court considered whether specific performance or damages were appropriate remedies. In our current case, Reah may seek to avoid the contract or claim damages due to the mistake about the panel's value and origin.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach a similar outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCMP 180/2005, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Contractual Integrity**: By requiring Reah to proceed with the contract, the court would uphold the integrity of contractual agreements, ensuring that parties cannot easily escape their obligations due to mistaken beliefs. This promotes certainty and reliability in commercial transactions.

2. **Equitable Remedies**: The court can still provide equitable remedies such as damages to address any unfairness. If Reah can prove that Felicity misrepresented the panel's value or origin, she may be entitled to damages. This balances the need to uphold contracts with the need to address genuine grievances.

3. **Encouraging Due Diligence**: This outcome encourages parties to conduct thorough due diligence before entering into contracts. Reah's situation highlights the importance of verifying the authenticity and value of items before making significant purchases.

4. **Consistency in Legal Principles**: Applying the same legal principles as in HCMP 180/2005 ensures consistency in the application of the law, which is crucial for the predictability and stability of legal outcomes.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCMP 180/2005, it would have the positive effects of upholding contractual integrity, providing equitable remedies, encouraging due diligence, and ensuring consistency in legal principles.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCMP 180/2005, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the Vendor had a contractual right against the Government to seek a re-grant of the Former Slipway at a nominal premium. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling (upholding the contract and requiring the Vendor to seek the re-grant) outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided a clear and feasible path for the Vendor to fulfill his contractual obligations, thereby maintaining the integrity of the contract and providing a remedy to the Purchaser.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent. Felicity does not have any similar contractual right or mechanism to rectify the mistaken belief about the stained glass panel's value and origin. The mistake here is about the intrinsic value and origin of the artwork, which cannot be rectified through any subsequent action by Felicity. This absence of a clear path to rectify the mistake significantly alters the balance of positive and negative effects, as it leaves Reah with a fundamentally different and less valuable item than what she believed she was purchasing.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in HCMP 180/2005: the intrinsic and subjective value of the artwork based on its perceived origin and authenticity. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the value of art is highly dependent on its provenance and the artist's reputation. In HCMP 180/2005, the issue was about the legal title and the ability to obtain a re-grant, which are more objective and rectifiable through legal mechanisms.

Due to the intrinsic and subjective value of the artwork in our current case, applying the same outcome (upholding the contract and requiring Reah to proceed with the purchase) would have more negative consequences such as significant financial loss and dissatisfaction for Reah, who believed she was purchasing an original work by Clarky. Unlike in HCMP 180/2005, where the Vendor could rectify the title issue through a re-grant, there is no similar remedy available to address the mistaken belief about the artwork's value and origin. This makes the mistake in our current case more fundamental and justifies a different outcome, such as allowing Reah to rescind the contract.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCMP 180/2005 should be stated as: "When both a common mistake about the subject matter or rights involved in a contract (i*) and a clear mechanism to rectify the mistake (m) are present, the court should decide to uphold the contract and require specific performance or damages (o)." Omitting the clear mechanism to rectify the mistake (m) from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence (q) of parties being forced to proceed with contracts that are fundamentally different from what they believed they were entering into, without any feasible way to rectify the situation. Indeed, the opinion in HCMP 180/2005 explicitly states that the Vendor's ability to seek a re-grant from the Government was crucial to their decision, as it provided a clear path to rectify the title issue and fulfill the contractual obligations.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCMP 180/2005 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence (u) of allowing parties to escape their contractual obligations due to mistaken beliefs when there is a feasible way to rectify the mistake. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence (u) occurring because there is no clear mechanism for Felicity to rectify the mistaken belief about the stained glass panel's value and origin. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should consider allowing Reah to rescind the contract due to the fundamental mistake about the artwork's value and origin, which cannot be rectified through any subsequent action by Felicity.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the clear mechanism to rectify the mistake (factor m), which was present in the precedent case HCMP 180/2005, requiring this factor for all similar cases of common mistake would lead to the undesirable consequence of parties being forced to proceed with contracts that are fundamentally different from what they believed they were entering into, without any feasible way to rectify the situation. Conversely, not requiring the clear mechanism to rectify the mistake (m) would allow for a more equitable outcome, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area. Specifically, it would ensure that parties are not unfairly bound to contracts based on significant misapprehensions about the subject matter, thereby promoting fairness and justice in contractual dealings.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the clear mechanism to rectify the mistake (factor m), which was present in HCMP 180/2005, we have the additional factor of the intrinsic and subjective value of the artwork based on its perceived origin and authenticity (factor n). This factor n, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of a common mistake about the subject matter (i*), serves a similar function to m in the precedent case. Given the presence of n, we submit that the reasoning in HCMP 180/2005 still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as fairness, justice, and the integrity of contractual agreements would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. This approach ensures that parties are not unfairly bound to contracts based on significant misapprehensions about the subject matter, thereby promoting a more equitable and just outcome.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCMP 180/2005, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of a common mistake about the subject matter and the need to determine whether the mistake is fundamental enough to void the contract. However, it also differs significantly in that the precedent involved a clear mechanism to rectify the mistake (the Vendor's right to seek a re-grant), whereas our current case lacks such a mechanism and involves the intrinsic and subjective value of artwork based on its perceived origin and authenticity.

The proposed legal rule from HCMP 180/2005, which suggests that a contract should be upheld and specific performance or damages should be required when there is a common mistake about the subject matter or rights involved, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in cases where no clear mechanism exists to rectify the mistake.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that upholding contractual integrity and providing equitable remedies is crucial (as argued in the initial analogy) and the counterargument that the absence of a mechanism to rectify the mistake and the intrinsic value of the artwork make the mistake more fundamental (as argued in the rebuttal).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, justice, and the integrity of contractual agreements, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the contract between Reah and Felicity should be voided due to the fundamental mistake about the artwork's value and origin. This decision aligns with the principle that contracts should not bind parties to fundamentally different terms than what they believed they were agreeing to, especially when no feasible way exists to rectify the mistake.

Key factors that influenced this outcome include the absence of a mechanism to rectify the mistake, the intrinsic and subjective value of the artwork, and the need to ensure fairness and justice in contractual dealings. Therefore, Reah should not be required to proceed with the contract, and the contract should be rescinded.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCMP001102/1998)
In the case of HCMP001102/1998 BETWEEN WIDE LINK LIMITED Plaintiff AND TAM SING CHEONG 1st Defendant CHEUNG CHEUNG 2nd Defendant TAI KING WAH 3rd Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the Plaintiff was entitled to rescind the Provisional Agreement for Sale and Purchase due to misrepresentation by the Defendants. The Defendants had misrepresented the tenancy details, which were material to the Plaintiff's decision to enter into the contract. The court ordered the rescission of the agreement and repayment of the deposits paid by the Plaintiff.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCMP001102/1998 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Misrepresentation**: In HCMP001102/1998, the Defendants misrepresented the tenancy details, which were material to the Plaintiff's decision. In our current case, Felicity's representation of the stained glass panel as a valuable work by Clarky can be seen as a misrepresentation if it was not actually created by him.
- **Materiality of Representation**: In HCMP001102/1998, the misrepresentation was material because it influenced the Plaintiff's decision to enter the contract. Similarly, in our current case, the representation of the panel as a valuable work by Clarky was material to Reah's decision to purchase it for £50,000.
- **Right to Rescind**: In HCMP001102/1998, the Plaintiff was granted the right to rescind the contract due to the material misrepresentation. In our current case, Reah may seek to rescind the contract on similar grounds.
- **Duty of Disclosure**: In HCMP001102/1998, the Defendants had a duty to disclose the true nature of the tenancy. In our current case, Felicity had a duty to disclose the true origin of the stained glass panel if she knew it was not created by Clarky.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCMP001102/1998)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a material misrepresentation that influences a party's decision to enter into a contract, the court should decide that the misled party has the right to rescind the contract. This rule was justified in HCMP001102/1998 because the misrepresentation materially affected the subject matter of the contract, and the Plaintiff relied on the misrepresented information to make their decision. The positive effects (E+) of allowing rescission in such cases include upholding the integrity of contractual agreements and protecting parties from being bound by contracts entered into under false pretenses. The negative effects (E-) are minimal, as the misrepresenting party is merely being held accountable for their false statements.

Applying this rule to our current case, Reah should be entitled to rescind the contract with Felicity due to the material misrepresentation regarding the origin and value of the stained glass panel. The misrepresentation significantly influenced Reah's decision to purchase the panel for £50,000, and she should not be bound by a contract based on false information.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCMP001102/1998) are present:

- **Misrepresentation**: In HCMP001102/1998, the Defendants misrepresented the tenancy details, which were material to the Plaintiff's decision. In our current case, Felicity's representation of the stained glass panel as a valuable work by Clarky can be seen as a misrepresentation if it was not actually created by him.
- **Materiality of Representation**: In HCMP001102/1998, the misrepresentation was material because it influenced the Plaintiff's decision to enter the contract. Similarly, in our current case, the representation of the panel as a valuable work by Clarky was material to Reah's decision to purchase it for £50,000.
- **Right to Rescind**: In HCMP001102/1998, the Plaintiff was granted the right to rescind the contract due to the material misrepresentation. In our current case, Reah may seek to rescind the contract on similar grounds.
- **Duty of Disclosure**: In HCMP001102/1998, the Defendants had a duty to disclose the true nature of the tenancy. In our current case, Felicity had a duty to disclose the true origin of the stained glass panel if she knew it was not created by Clarky.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome: allowing Reah to rescind the contract. This decision would be justified because, as in HCMP001102/1998, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Contractual Integrity**: Allowing rescission in cases of material misrepresentation ensures that parties are not bound by contracts entered into under false pretenses. This upholds the integrity of contractual agreements and promotes fairness in commercial transactions.
   
2. **Protecting the Misled Party**: By granting Reah the right to rescind the contract, the court would protect her from suffering financial loss due to reliance on false information. This aligns with the principle of protecting parties from being unfairly disadvantaged in contractual dealings.

3. **Deterring Misrepresentation**: A decision in favor of Reah would serve as a deterrent to parties who might consider making false representations to induce others into contracts. This promotes honesty and transparency in commercial transactions.

4. **Consistency in Legal Precedent**: Applying the same rule as in HCMP001102/1998 ensures consistency in legal decisions, which is crucial for the predictability and stability of the legal system.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCMP001102/1998, it would have the positive effects of upholding contractual integrity, protecting the misled party, deterring misrepresentation, and ensuring consistency in legal precedent.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCMP001102/1998, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the misrepresentation was made by the Defendants, who were the vendors of the property. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling (upholding contractual integrity, protecting the misled party, deterring misrepresentation, and ensuring consistency in legal precedent) outweighed any potential drawbacks because the Defendants had a duty to disclose accurate information about the tenancy, and their failure to do so directly impacted the Plaintiff's decision to enter into the contract. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of the misrepresentation being made by the vendor is notably absent as there is no clear evidence that Felicity, the vendor, knew or should have known that the stained glass panel was not created by Clarky. This absence of knowledge or intent to misrepresent on Felicity's part weakens the argument for rescission based on misrepresentation.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in HCMP001102/1998: the subjective nature of the valuation of art. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the value of art can be highly subjective and dependent on various factors such as provenance, artist reputation, and market trends. Due to this subjective nature, applying the same outcome (rescission of the contract) in our case would have more negative consequences such as creating uncertainty in art transactions and potentially undermining the stability of art market contracts than positive ones, unlike in HCMP001102/1998 where the misrepresentation was about objective tenancy details. The subjective valuation of art introduces a level of uncertainty that was not present in the precedent case, making it less clear-cut that Reah should be entitled to rescind the contract based on her mistaken belief about the panel's value.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCMP001102/1998 should be stated as: "When both [material misrepresentation by the vendor] and [objective, verifiable facts] are present, the court should decide [to allow rescission of the contract]." Omitting [objective, verifiable facts] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q], which is creating uncertainty in transactions involving subjective valuations, such as art, and potentially undermining the stability of the art market. Indeed, the opinion in HCMP001102/1998 explicitly states that the misrepresentation of tenancy details, which were objective and verifiable, was crucial to their decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCMP001102/1998 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of parties being bound by contracts entered into under false pretenses based on objective, verifiable facts. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence occurring because the valuation of art is inherently subjective and not easily verifiable. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—protecting parties from misrepresentations of objective facts—is not relevant to our situation involving subjective art valuation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of "misrepresentation by the vendor," which was present in the precedent case HCMP001102/1998, requiring this factor for all similar cases of material misrepresentation would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would create a loophole where vendors could avoid liability for misrepresentation simply by claiming ignorance, even when the misrepresentation significantly impacts the buyer's decision. Conversely, not requiring the vendor's knowledge of the misrepresentation would allow for a more equitable outcome, ensuring that buyers are protected from entering contracts based on false information, regardless of the vendor's intent. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which aim to ensure fairness and protect parties from being misled.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of "misrepresentation by the vendor," which was present in HCMP001102/1998, we have the additional factor of "the subjective nature of art valuation." This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of material misrepresentation, serves a similar function to the vendor's misrepresentation in the precedent case. Given the presence of the subjective nature of art valuation, we submit that the reasoning in HCMP001102/1998 still applies. The positive effects on legal values, such as upholding contractual integrity, protecting the misled party, and deterring misrepresentation, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. This approach ensures that buyers like Reah are not unfairly bound by contracts based on significant misrepresentations, even when the misrepresentation pertains to subjective valuations.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCMP001102/1998, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of material misrepresentation and its significant influence on the decision to enter into the contract. However, it also differs in crucial aspects, particularly the subjective nature of art valuation and the lack of clear evidence that Felicity, the vendor, knew or should have known that the stained glass panel was not created by Clarky.

The proposed legal rule from HCMP001102/1998, which allows for rescission of the contract in cases of material misrepresentation by the vendor, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in contexts involving subjective valuations like art.

We've weighed arguments from both sides. A strong point from the Plaintiff's side is that the misrepresentation was material and significantly influenced Reah's decision to purchase the panel for £50,000. A strong point from the Defendant's side is that the subjective nature of art valuation introduces a level of uncertainty that was not present in the precedent case, making it less clear-cut that Reah should be entitled to rescind the contract based on her mistaken belief about the panel's value.

Considering the underlying legal principles of upholding contractual integrity, protecting parties from being misled, and ensuring fairness in commercial transactions, we conclude that Reah should be entitled to rescind the contract. This decision aligns with the precedent set in HCMP001102/1998, as the misrepresentation was material and significantly influenced Reah's decision. Additionally, it serves justice by protecting Reah from suffering financial loss due to reliance on false information, even if the misrepresentation pertains to subjective valuations.

Therefore, we find that Reah has the right to rescind the contract with Felicity due to the material misrepresentation regarding the origin and value of the stained glass panel. This decision upholds the integrity of contractual agreements and promotes fairness in commercial transactions, consistent with the principles established in HCMP001102/1998.

### Minor Premise:

1. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1:
- Reah has entered into a contract with Felicity after a misrepresentation.
- The misrepresentation was made to her by Felicity.
- Reah has suffered loss in the form of the difference in value between what she thought she was buying (£50,000) and what she actually bought (£5,000).
- If Felicity had made the misrepresentation fraudulently, Felicity would have been liable to damages.
- However, Felicity may argue that she had reasonable grounds to believe and did believe up to the time the contract was made that the facts represented were true, as she believed the piece was her father's work.
- Therefore, this section may not apply if Felicity can prove her belief was reasonable.

2. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2:
- Reah has entered into a contract of sale of the stained glass panel.
- Felicity's representation that the panel was her father's work is a misrepresentation.
- Reah has entered into the contract after this misrepresentation has been made to her.
- Felicity did not make this misrepresentation fraudulently.
- Reah would be entitled, by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract.
- Reah is claiming that the contract ought to be rescinded.
- Balancing the nature of the misrepresentation,
  * it is an innocent misrepresentation but it is material and significantly affects the value of the panel;
  * the loss that would be suffered by Reah if the contract was upheld is substantial (£45,000);
  * the loss to Felicity if rescission were granted would be the return of the panel and the loss of the sale price.
- Therefore, this section applies and the court would likely declare the contract subsisting and award Reah damages in lieu of rescission.

### Conclusion:

Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2 applies, and the court would declare the contract subsisting and award Reah damages, which is the difference in value (£45,000), in lieu of rescission.

   - The court cannot predicate with certainty what the contract was, and that it is, by common mistake, wrongly expressed in the document, as the true nature of the panel was not known to either party at the time of the agreement.

### Conclusion:

Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited applies, and the court may refuse to allow Reah to enforce the contract as it would ordinarily be construed, given the significant difference in value and nature of the item. Therefore, Reah is not obligated to proceed with the contract.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCMP 180/2005 BETWEEN TONY INVESTMENTS LIMITED and FUNG SUN KWAN BERNARD)
In the case of HCMP 180/2005 BETWEEN TONY INVESTMENTS LIMITED (德隆投資有限公司) Plaintiff and FUNG SUN KWAN BERNARD (馮燊均) (alias FUNG SUN KWAN) trading as KWONG YEE WOO (SHIPBUILDING CONTRACTORS) Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the vendor had no title to the Former Slipway and thus could not convey good title to the purchaser. The court found that the vendor's failure to obtain a re-grant from the Government meant that the vendor could not fulfill the contractual obligation to convey the property, leading to the conclusion that the vendor was in breach of the contract.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCMP 180/2005 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Good Title**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCMP 180/2005, the vendor could not convey good title to the Former Slipway because the re-grant from the Government was not obtained.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 in Current Case**: Reah believed she was purchasing an original work by Clarky, but the piece turned out to be a collaborative work by beginner students, thus not holding the value or title she believed it had.

- **Legal Concept 2: Common Mistake**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCMP 180/2005, both parties were under the mistaken belief that the vendor had the right to convey the Former Slipway.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 in Current Case**: Both Reah and Felicity were under the mistaken belief that the stained glass panel was an original work by Clarky, not a student piece.

- **Legal Concept 3: Implied Warranty of Title**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCMP 180/2005, it was implied that the vendor had the title to sell the property, which he did not.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 in Current Case**: It is implied that Felicity had the title to sell an original work by Clarky, which she did not.

- **Legal Concept 4: Specific Performance and Damages**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCMP 180/2005, the court considered whether specific performance was appropriate given the vendor's inability to convey good title.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 in Current Case**: Reah is questioning whether she must proceed with the contract or if she can claim damages due to the mistake about the artwork's authenticity and value.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCMP 180/2005)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern involving a common mistake about the title or value of the subject matter of a contract, the court should decide that the contract is voidable and the party misled by the mistake should not be compelled to proceed with the contract. This rule was justified in HCMP 180/2005 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that parties are not bound by contracts based on fundamental mistakes about the subject matter outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially voiding contracts. This approach upholds the principles of fairness and equity in contractual dealings, ensuring that parties are not unfairly disadvantaged by significant misunderstandings about the nature of what they are contracting for.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCMP 180/2005 BETWEEN TONY INVESTMENTS LIMITED and FUNG SUN KWAN BERNARD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Good Title**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCMP 180/2005, the vendor could not convey good title to the Former Slipway because the re-grant from the Government was not obtained.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 in Current Case**: Reah believed she was purchasing an original work by Clarky, but the piece turned out to be a collaborative work by beginner students, thus not holding the value or title she believed it had.

- **Legal Concept 2: Common Mistake**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCMP 180/2005, both parties were under the mistaken belief that the vendor had the right to convey the Former Slipway.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 in Current Case**: Both Reah and Felicity were under the mistaken belief that the stained glass panel was an original work by Clarky, not a student piece.

- **Legal Concept 3: Implied Warranty of Title**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCMP 180/2005, it was implied that the vendor had the title to sell the property, which he did not.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 in Current Case**: It is implied that Felicity had the title to sell an original work by Clarky, which she did not.

- **Legal Concept 4: Specific Performance and Damages**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCMP 180/2005, the court considered whether specific performance was appropriate given the vendor's inability to convey good title.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 in Current Case**: Reah is questioning whether she must proceed with the contract or if she can claim damages due to the mistake about the artwork's authenticity and value.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome: the contract should be considered voidable due to the common mistake. This decision would be justified because, as in HCMP 180/2005, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Fairness and Equity**: Ensuring that parties are not bound by contracts based on fundamental mistakes about the subject matter upholds the principles of fairness and equity in contractual dealings. Reah should not be compelled to proceed with a contract for an item that is fundamentally different from what she believed she was purchasing.

2. **Protecting Parties from Unfair Disadvantage**: Allowing Reah to void the contract protects her from being unfairly disadvantaged by a significant misunderstanding about the nature and value of the artwork. This aligns with the principle that contracts should not be enforced when they are based on a fundamental misapprehension.

3. **Encouraging Due Diligence**: This outcome encourages parties to conduct thorough due diligence and ensures that sellers provide accurate information about the items they are selling. It promotes transparency and honesty in transactions.

4. **Consistency in Legal Application**: Applying the same rule as in the precedent case ensures consistency in the legal application of the doctrine of mistake, providing predictability and stability in the law.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCMP 180/2005, it would have the positive effects of upholding fairness, protecting parties from unfair disadvantage, encouraging due diligence, and ensuring consistency in legal application.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCMP 180/2005 BETWEEN TONY INVESTMENTS LIMITED and FUNG SUN KWAN BERNARD, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the vendor had a contractual right against the Government to seek a re-grant of the Former Slipway at a nominal premium. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling (upholding the contract and requiring the vendor to obtain the re-grant) outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided a clear and actionable path for the vendor to fulfill the contractual obligation, thus making specific performance a viable remedy.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent. Felicity does not have any similar contractual right or clear path to rectify the mistake regarding the authenticity and value of the stained glass panel. The mistake here is about the intrinsic nature and value of the artwork, which cannot be corrected or remedied through any subsequent action by Felicity. This absence of a clear and actionable path to rectify the mistake significantly alters the balance of positive and negative effects, making it less justifiable to compel Reah to proceed with the contract.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in HCMP 180/2005 BETWEEN TONY INVESTMENTS LIMITED and FUNG SUN KWAN BERNARD. This factor is the intrinsic and non-remediable nature of the mistake regarding the artwork's authenticity and value. In the precedent case, the mistake could be remedied by obtaining a re-grant from the Government, which was a clear and actionable step. However, in our current case, the mistake about the stained glass panel being an original work by Clarky versus a student piece is intrinsic and cannot be remedied. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it means that the performance of the contract cannot be aligned with the parties' original understanding and expectations.

Due to this intrinsic and non-remediable nature of the mistake, applying the same outcome (compelling specific performance) in our case would have more negative consequences, such as forcing Reah to accept a fundamentally different and less valuable item than what she believed she was purchasing. This would result in an unfair and inequitable outcome, unlike in HCMP 180/2005, where the mistake could be rectified, and the contract could be performed as originally intended. Therefore, the presence of this crucial factor in our current case justifies a different outcome, allowing Reah to void the contract due to the fundamental mistake.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCMP 180/2005 BETWEEN TONY INVESTMENTS LIMITED and FUNG SUN KWAN BERNARD should be stated as: "When both [a common mistake about the title or value of the subject matter of a contract] and [the ability to rectify the mistake through a clear and actionable path] are present, the court should decide [to compel specific performance or uphold the contract]." Omitting [the ability to rectify the mistake through a clear and actionable path] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of compelling parties to proceed with contracts based on fundamental and non-remediable mistakes, resulting in unfair and inequitable outcomes]. Indeed, the opinion in HCMP 180/2005 explicitly states that the vendor's ability to seek a re-grant from the Government was crucial to their decision, as it provided a clear path to rectify the mistake and fulfill the contractual obligation.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCMP 180/2005 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of parties being unfairly bound by contracts based on fundamental mistakes about the subject matter, while still allowing for the contract to be fulfilled if the mistake could be rectified through a clear and actionable path. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence occurring because the mistake about the stained glass panel's authenticity and value is intrinsic and non-remediable. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—to allow for the rectification of mistakes and fulfillment of contracts—is not relevant to our situation. In our case, the mistake cannot be rectified, and compelling Reah to proceed with the contract would result in an unfair and inequitable outcome.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of a clear and actionable path to rectify the mistake (which was present in the precedent case HCMP 180/2005 BETWEEN TONY INVESTMENTS LIMITED and FUNG SUN KWAN BERNARD), requiring this factor for all similar cases of common mistake would lead to the undesirable consequence of compelling parties to proceed with contracts based on fundamental and non-remediable mistakes. This would result in unfair and inequitable outcomes, as parties would be forced to accept significantly different and less valuable items than what they believed they were purchasing. Conversely, not requiring this factor would allow for the desirable outcome of protecting parties from being unfairly disadvantaged by significant misunderstandings about the nature and value of the subject matter. This better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and equity in contract law, ensuring that parties are not bound by contracts based on fundamental mistakes that cannot be rectified.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of a clear and actionable path to rectify the mistake (which was present in HCMP 180/2005), we have the additional factor of the intrinsic and non-remediable nature of the mistake regarding the artwork's authenticity and value. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of a common mistake about the title or value of the subject matter, serves a similar function to the clear and actionable path in the precedent case. Given the presence of this intrinsic and non-remediable nature of the mistake, we submit that the reasoning in HCMP 180/2005 still applies, as the positive effects on fairness and equity would still outweigh any potential negative consequences. This ensures that parties are not unfairly bound by contracts based on fundamental and non-remediable mistakes, just as the precedent case ensured that parties were not bound by contracts based on rectifiable mistakes.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCMP 180/2005 BETWEEN TONY INVESTMENTS LIMITED and FUNG SUN KWAN BERNARD, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of a common mistake about the title or value of the subject matter and the implied warranty of title. However, it also differs significantly in that the mistake in the current case is intrinsic and non-remediable, whereas in the precedent case, the mistake could be rectified through a clear and actionable path (i.e., obtaining a re-grant from the Government).

The proposed legal rule of allowing a contract to be voidable due to a common mistake about the title or value of the subject matter finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of upholding fairness and equity in contractual dealings (a strong point for allowing the contract to be voidable) and the need for consistency in legal application (a strong point for following the precedent).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, equity, and the protection of parties from being unfairly disadvantaged by significant misunderstandings, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Reah should be allowed to void the contract due to the fundamental and non-remediable mistake about the artwork's authenticity and value. This decision aligns with the principles of justice and legal consistency, ensuring that parties are not bound by contracts based on fundamental mistakes that cannot be rectified.

Therefore, Reah is not obligated to proceed with the contract, and she may seek to void the agreement and potentially claim damages for any loss suffered due to the mistake. This outcome ensures that the legal system remains fair and equitable, protecting parties from significant and non-remediable misunderstandings in contractual dealings.

### Major Premise:

1. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited

   Conditions:
   - There is a mutual or common mistake about whether a written document correctly reflects what the parties had, on an objective assessment, agreed it should contain; or
   - There is a unilateral mistake where one party knows that the other party thinks a term is not there, or knows that the other party is mistaken about its meaning

   Consequences:
   - The court may rectify the document to reflect the true agreement of the parties

   Exceptions:
   - The mistake is not about the terms previously agreed; or
   - The court cannot predicate with certainty what the contract was

### Minor Premise:

1. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited:
- There is a mutual mistake about whether the stained glass panel is an original work by Clarky or a piece created by his students.
- Both Felicity and Reah believed the panel to be an original work by Clarky, which was the basis of their agreement.
- The mistake is about the terms previously agreed, specifically the identity and value of the artwork.
- The court can predicate with certainty that the contract was based on the mutual belief that the panel was an original work by Clarky.

### Conclusion:

Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited applies, and the court may rectify the contract to reflect the true agreement of the parties, which was based on the mutual belief that the stained glass panel was an original work by Clarky. Therefore, Reah may not have to proceed with the contract as initially agreed, and the contract may be rectified to reflect the true nature of the artwork.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (CACV 132/2011 BANK OF CHINA (HONG KONG) LIMITED v KEEN LLOYD ENERGY LIMITED)
In the case of CACV 132/2011 BANK OF CHINA (HONG KONG) LIMITED (formerly known as SIN HUA BANK LIMITED) Plaintiff and KEEN LLOYD ENERGY LIMITED (formerly known as KEEN LLOYD INVESTMENTS LIMITED) 1st Defendant KEEN LLOYD RESOURCES LIMITED (formerly known as KEEN LLOYD (HOLDINGS) LIMITED) 2nd Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the defences of illegality and mistake raised by the defendants were unsustainable and should be struck out. The court held that the defence of illegality was not sustainable because the facilities agreements were governed by Hong Kong law and were to be performed in Hong Kong. The defence of mistake, which hinged on the illegality defence, also failed. The court further noted that the plea of mistake was inconsistent with the defendants' previous allegations of misrepresentation and was an abuse of process.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in CACV 132/2011 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Common Mistake**: In both cases, the parties entered into a contract under a mistaken belief about a fundamental aspect of the contract.
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In CACV 132/2011, the defendants believed that the banking facilities were lawful and proper under the governing laws. In the current case, Reah believed she was purchasing an original work by Clarky, whereas it was actually a piece created by beginner students.
- **Legal Concept 2: Positive Belief**: The mistake must involve a positive belief held by the parties at the time of contract formation.
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In CACV 132/2011, the defendants had a positive belief that the facilities were lawful. In the current case, Reah had a positive belief that the stained glass panel was an original work by Clarky.
- **Legal Concept 3: Impossibility of Performance**: The non-existence of the state of affairs must render the performance of the contract impossible.
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In CACV 132/2011, the court found that the performance of the contract was not rendered impossible by the mistake. In the current case, the performance of the contract (delivery of the stained glass panel) is not rendered impossible by the mistake about its origin.
- **Legal Concept 4: Inconsistency with Previous Pleas**: The plea of mistake must not be inconsistent with previous allegations or actions taken by the party.
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In CACV 132/2011, the defendants' plea of mistake was inconsistent with their previous allegations of misrepresentation. In the current case, there is no indication of previous inconsistent pleas by Reah, but the principle remains relevant.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (CACV 132/2011)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern involving a common mistake about a fundamental aspect of the contract, a positive belief held by the parties, and the non-existence of the state of affairs not rendering performance impossible, the court should decide that the plea of mistake is unsustainable. This rule was justified in CACV 132/2011 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring contractual certainty and preventing abuse of process outweighed the negative effects (E-) of potentially allowing a party to escape a contract based on a mistaken belief.

Applying this rule to the current case, Reah's plea of mistake is likely to be unsustainable because:
1. The mistake about the origin of the stained glass panel does not render the performance of the contract (delivery of the panel) impossible.
2. Reah had a positive belief about the origin of the panel, but this belief does not affect the fundamental performance of the contract.
3. There is no indication of previous inconsistent pleas by Reah, but the principle of ensuring contractual certainty remains relevant.

Therefore, Reah may still be required to proceed with the contract despite her mistaken belief about the origin of the stained glass panel.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (CACV 132/2011 BANK OF CHINA (HONG KONG) LIMITED v KEEN LLOYD ENERGY LIMITED) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Common Mistake**: In both cases, the parties entered into a contract under a mistaken belief about a fundamental aspect of the contract.
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In CACV 132/2011, the defendants believed that the banking facilities were lawful and proper under the governing laws. In the current case, Reah believed she was purchasing an original work by Clarky, whereas it was actually a piece created by beginner students.

- **Legal Concept 2: Positive Belief**: The mistake must involve a positive belief held by the parties at the time of contract formation.
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In CACV 132/2011, the defendants had a positive belief that the facilities were lawful. In the current case, Reah had a positive belief that the stained glass panel was an original work by Clarky.

- **Legal Concept 3: Impossibility of Performance**: The non-existence of the state of affairs must render the performance of the contract impossible.
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In CACV 132/2011, the court found that the performance of the contract was not rendered impossible by the mistake. In the current case, the performance of the contract (delivery of the stained glass panel) is not rendered impossible by the mistake about its origin.

- **Legal Concept 4: Inconsistency with Previous Pleas**: The plea of mistake must not be inconsistent with previous allegations or actions taken by the party.
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In CACV 132/2011, the defendants' plea of mistake was inconsistent with their previous allegations of misrepresentation. In the current case, there is no indication of previous inconsistent pleas by Reah, but the principle remains relevant.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome: the plea of mistake is unsustainable, and Reah may still be required to proceed with the contract despite her mistaken belief about the origin of the stained glass panel. 

This decision would be justified because, as in CACV 132/2011, it would have the following positive effects:
1. **Ensuring Contractual Certainty**: Upholding the contract despite the mistake ensures that parties cannot easily escape their contractual obligations based on a mistaken belief, thereby promoting stability and predictability in commercial transactions.
2. **Preventing Abuse of Process**: Allowing Reah to rescind the contract based on her mistaken belief could open the door to potential abuse, where parties might frequently claim mistake to avoid unfavorable contracts.
3. **Encouraging Due Diligence**: This outcome reinforces the principle of caveat emptor (buyer beware), encouraging buyers to conduct thorough due diligence before entering into contracts, thereby fostering a more informed and cautious marketplace.

Therefore, the court should find that Reah's plea of mistake is unsustainable, and she must proceed with the contract.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case CACV 132/2011 BANK OF CHINA (HONG KONG) LIMITED v KEEN LLOYD ENERGY LIMITED, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the factor of **previous inconsistent pleas**. The defendants in that case had previously alleged misrepresentation, which was inconsistent with their later plea of mistake. This inconsistency was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—such as maintaining contractual certainty and preventing abuse of process—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it demonstrated that the defendants were attempting to manipulate the legal process to avoid their obligations.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of **previous inconsistent pleas** is notably absent. Reah has not made any previous allegations or taken any actions that are inconsistent with her current plea of mistake. Therefore, the justification for striking out the plea of mistake based on inconsistency does not apply here.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor of **the unique nature of the subject matter (artwork)** that was not present in CACV 132/2011. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of common mistake. In the current case, the subject matter is a piece of artwork, which inherently involves subjective elements such as artistic value and provenance. These elements are crucial to the buyer's decision and the perceived value of the item.

Because of this unique factor, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences than positive ones. Specifically, it would undermine the principle of fairness in transactions involving unique and subjective items like artwork. Unlike in CACV 132/2011, where the subject matter was a financial facility governed by clear legal and regulatory frameworks, the subjective nature of art means that a mistake about its provenance or authorship fundamentally alters the nature of the contract. Therefore, the balance of positive and negative effects shifts, and the plea of mistake should be considered more sympathetically in this context to ensure fairness and equity in transactions involving unique items.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from CACV 132/2011 BANK OF CHINA (HONG KONG) LIMITED v KEEN LLOYD ENERGY LIMITED should be stated as: "When both [a common mistake about a fundamental aspect of the contract] and [previous inconsistent pleas] are present, the court should decide [that the plea of mistake is unsustainable]." Omitting [previous inconsistent pleas] from this rule could lead to [an undesirable consequence of undermining the principle of fairness in transactions involving unique and subjective items like artwork]. Indeed, the opinion in CACV 132/2011 explicitly states that the inconsistency of the defendants' plea of mistake with their previous allegations of misrepresentation was crucial to their decision, highlighting the importance of maintaining consistency in legal pleadings to prevent abuse of process.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in CACV 132/2011 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of parties manipulating the legal process by making inconsistent pleas to avoid their contractual obligations. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because Reah has not made any previous allegations or taken any actions that are inconsistent with her current plea of mistake. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—preventing abuse of process through inconsistent pleas—is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should consider the unique nature of the subject matter (artwork) and the principle of fairness in transactions involving such items, which supports a more sympathetic consideration of Reah's plea of mistake.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of **previous inconsistent pleas**, which was present in the precedent case CACV 132/2011 BANK OF CHINA (HONG KONG) LIMITED v KEEN LLOYD ENERGY LIMITED, requiring this factor for all similar cases of common mistake would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would mean that parties who have not previously made inconsistent pleas would be unfairly bound to contracts based on fundamental mistakes, even in cases involving unique and subjective items like artwork. Conversely, not requiring the factor of previous inconsistent pleas would allow for a more equitable outcome, ensuring that parties are not unfairly held to contracts based on significant mistakes about the nature of the subject matter. This better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and equity in contract law, particularly in transactions involving unique and subjective items.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of **previous inconsistent pleas**, which was present in CACV 132/2011, we have the additional factor of **the unique nature of the subject matter (artwork)**. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of a common mistake about a fundamental aspect of the contract, serves a similar function to the factor of previous inconsistent pleas in the precedent case. Given the presence of the unique nature of the subject matter, we submit that the reasoning in CACV 132/2011 still applies, as the positive effects on fairness and equity in transactions involving unique items would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. Therefore, Reah's plea of mistake should be sympathetically considered, and she should not be required to proceed with the contract.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to CACV 132/2011 BANK OF CHINA (HONG KONG) LIMITED v KEEN LLOYD ENERGY LIMITED, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of a common mistake about a fundamental aspect of the contract and the positive belief held by the parties at the time of contract formation. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of previous inconsistent pleas and the unique nature of the subject matter (artwork).

The proposed legal rule from CACV 132/2011, which suggests that a plea of mistake is unsustainable when both a common mistake and previous inconsistent pleas are present, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in the context of transactions involving unique and subjective items like artwork.

We've weighed arguments from both sides. A strong point from the initial analogy is the emphasis on ensuring contractual certainty and preventing abuse of process. Conversely, a strong point from the rebuttal is the importance of fairness in transactions involving unique and subjective items, which may warrant a more sympathetic consideration of the plea of mistake.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, equity, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Reah's plea of mistake should be sympathetically considered. The unique nature of the subject matter (artwork) and the absence of previous inconsistent pleas distinguish this case from the precedent, justifying a different outcome. Therefore, Reah should not be required to proceed with the contract, as the mistake about the origin of the stained glass panel fundamentally alters the nature of the contract and affects the fairness of the transaction.

This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency, particularly in transactions involving unique and subjective items.

   - He shall be entitled to rescind the contract, subject to the provisions of the Ordinance, notwithstanding that the misrepresentation has become a term of the contract or the contract has been performed, or both.

   Exceptions:
   - None

2. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1

   Conditions:
   - A person has entered into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to him by another party thereto.
   - As a result thereof he has suffered loss.
   - If the person making the misrepresentation would be liable to damages in respect thereof had the misrepresentation been made fraudulently.

   Consequences:
   - The person making the misrepresentation shall be liable to damages notwithstanding that the misrepresentation was not made fraudulently.

   Exceptions:
   - The person making the misrepresentation proves that he had reasonable grounds to believe and did believe up to the time the contract was made that the facts represented were true.

3. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - A person has entered into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to him otherwise than fraudulently.
   - He would be entitled, by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract.
   - It is claimed, in any proceedings arising out of the contract, that the contract ought to be or has been rescinded.
   - The court or arbitrator is of opinion that it would be equitable to do so, having regard to the nature of the misrepresentation and the loss that would be caused by it if the contract were upheld, as well as to the loss that rescission would cause to the other party.

   Consequences:
   - The court or arbitrator may declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission.

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 2:
- Reah has entered into a contract with Felicity after a misrepresentation has been made to her.
- The misrepresentation has become a term of the contract, as Reah believed she was purchasing an original work by Clarky.
- Reah would be entitled to rescind the contract without alleging fraud because the misrepresentation was material to her decision to enter into the contract.
- Therefore, Reah is entitled to rescind the contract.

2. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1:
- Reah has entered into a contract with Felicity after a misrepresentation has been made to her by Felicity.
- As a result, Reah has suffered loss, as the value of the stained glass panel is significantly less than what she paid.
- If Felicity had made the misrepresentation fraudulently, she would be liable to damages.
- However, Felicity may argue that she had reasonable grounds to believe and did believe up to the time the contract was made that the facts represented were true.
- Therefore, this section may not apply if Felicity can prove her belief was reasonable.

3. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2:
- Reah has entered into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to her otherwise than fraudulently.
- Reah would be entitled, by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract.
- It is claimed in any proceedings arising out of the contract that the contract ought to be or has been rescinded.
- The court or arbitrator would consider it equitable to declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission, considering the nature of the misrepresentation and the loss that would be caused by it if the contract were upheld, as well as the loss that rescission would cause to Felicity.
- Therefore, the court may declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission.

### Conclusion:

Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 2 applies, and Reah is entitled to rescind the contract. If Felicity can prove she had reasonable grounds to believe the facts represented were true, Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1 may not apply. However, Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2 may apply, and the court may declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission.

### Minor Premise:

1. Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited:

   - There is a mutual mistake about whether the stained glass panel is an original work by Clarky or a piece created by his students.
   - Reah believed she was purchasing an original work by Clarky, while Felicity did not clarify this point, leading to a mistaken belief about the meaning of the contract.

   Consequences:
   - The court may refuse to allow Felicity to enforce the contract as it would ordinarily be construed, given the mistaken belief about the nature of the stained glass panel.

   Exceptions:
   - The mistake is about whether the document (the agreement) correctly reflects the terms previously agreed, specifically the nature of the stained glass panel.
   - The court can predicate with certainty that the contract was based on the mutual mistake regarding the nature of the stained glass panel.

### Conclusion:

Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited applies, and the court may refuse to allow Felicity to enforce the contract as it would ordinarily be construed, given the mutual mistake about the nature of the stained glass panel. Therefore, Reah is not obligated to proceed with the contract.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCMP 180/2005)
In the case of HCMP 180/2005 BETWEEN TONY INVESTMENTS LIMITED (德隆投資有限公司) Plaintiff and FUNG SUN KWAN BERNARD(馮燊均) (alias FUNG SUN KWAN) trading as KWONG YEE WOO (SHIPBUILDING CONTRACTORS) Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the Vendor had no title to the Former Slipway and that the requisitions for a re-grant were reasonable. The Vendor's failure to show good title meant that the Purchaser was not obligated to proceed with the contract. The court also dismissed the Vendor's defence of common mistake, holding that the mistake did not render the contract void.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCMP 180/2005 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Good Title**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Vendor failed to show good title to the Former Slipway. In our current case, Felicity may not have good title to the stained glass panel as an original work by Clarky.
- **Legal Concept 2: Common Mistake**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Vendor argued that there was a common mistake regarding the rights over the Former Slipway. In our current case, Reah and Felicity were under a common misapprehension that the stained glass panel was an original work by Clarky.
- **Legal Concept 3: Implied Warranty**: In HCMP 180/2005, it was implied that the Vendor warranted good title. In our current case, it is implied that Felicity warranted the stained glass panel as an original work by Clarky.
- **Legal Concept 4: Specific Performance**: In HCMP 180/2005, the court considered whether specific performance was appropriate. In our current case, Reah is questioning whether she must proceed with the contract, which is akin to seeking specific performance.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCMP 180/2005)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a common mistake regarding the quality or title of the subject matter of a contract, the court should decide that the contract is voidable. This rule was justified in HCMP 180/2005 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that parties are not bound by contracts based on fundamental misapprehensions about the subject matter outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially voiding contracts. The court in HCMP 180/2005 emphasized the importance of good title and the implications of common mistake, which are crucial to maintaining fairness and certainty in contractual dealings.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCMP 180/2005) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Good Title**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Vendor failed to show good title to the Former Slipway. In our current case, Felicity may not have good title to the stained glass panel as an original work by Clarky. Both cases involve a fundamental issue regarding the title or authenticity of the subject matter being sold.

- **Legal Concept 2: Common Mistake**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Vendor argued that there was a common mistake regarding the rights over the Former Slipway. In our current case, Reah and Felicity were under a common misapprehension that the stained glass panel was an original work by Clarky. Both cases involve a shared fundamental mistake about a crucial aspect of the contract.

- **Legal Concept 3: Implied Warranty**: In HCMP 180/2005, it was implied that the Vendor warranted good title. In our current case, it is implied that Felicity warranted the stained glass panel as an original work by Clarky. Both cases involve an implied warranty that the subject matter of the contract is as represented.

- **Legal Concept 4: Specific Performance**: In HCMP 180/2005, the court considered whether specific performance was appropriate. In our current case, Reah is questioning whether she must proceed with the contract, which is akin to seeking specific performance. Both cases involve the question of whether the contract should be enforced as originally agreed upon.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCMP 180/2005. This decision would be justified because, as in HCMP 180/2005, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Fairness and Equity**: Ensuring that parties are not bound by contracts based on fundamental misapprehensions about the subject matter maintains fairness and equity in contractual dealings. Reah should not be compelled to proceed with a contract for an item that is fundamentally different from what she believed she was purchasing.

2. **Certainty in Transactions**: Upholding the principle that a contract can be voided due to a common mistake about a fundamental aspect of the subject matter promotes certainty in transactions. Parties can have confidence that they will not be unfairly bound by contracts based on significant misunderstandings.

3. **Encouragement of Due Diligence**: This outcome encourages parties to conduct thorough due diligence before entering into contracts. It underscores the importance of verifying the authenticity and title of the subject matter, thereby reducing the likelihood of disputes.

4. **Protection of Legitimate Expectations**: By voiding contracts based on fundamental mistakes, the court protects the legitimate expectations of the parties. Reah's expectation was to purchase an original work by Clarky, and enforcing the contract despite the mistake would undermine her legitimate expectations.

Therefore, given the shared fact patterns and the positive effects on the underlying values and principles of the law, the court should reach the same outcome as in HCMP 180/2005. The contract between Reah and Felicity should be considered voidable due to the common mistake regarding the stained glass panel's authenticity and value.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCMP 180/2005, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the factor of **good title**. The Vendor's failure to show good title to the Former Slipway was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling (protecting the Purchaser from acquiring a property with defective title) outweighed any potential drawbacks (such as the Vendor's inability to complete the sale). This was because the absence of good title meant that the Purchaser would face significant legal and practical difficulties in using the property, including the risk of enforcement action by the Government.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of **good title** is notably absent. The issue here is not about the title to the stained glass panel but rather its **authenticity and value**. Felicity does have good title to the stained glass panel, but the common mistake pertains to the panel's origin and worth. Therefore, the absence of a title issue in our current case means that the reasoning based on good title in HCMP 180/2005 does not directly apply.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor of **authenticity and value** that was not present in HCMP 180/2005. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of common mistake. In HCMP 180/2005, the mistake was about the legal rights over the property (title), whereas in our current case, the mistake is about the factual quality of the stained glass panel (authenticity and value).

Because of this factor, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences than positive ones. Specifically, voiding the contract due to a mistake about the panel's authenticity and value could undermine the stability and predictability of commercial transactions. It would set a precedent that allows parties to rescind contracts based on subjective valuations and expert opinions obtained after the fact, which could lead to increased litigation and uncertainty in the market.

Therefore, the presence of the factor of **authenticity and value** in our current case, which was absent in HCMP 180/2005, suggests that the same outcome (voiding the contract) would not be appropriate. Instead, the court should consider whether the mistake about the panel's authenticity and value is so fundamental that it renders the contract voidable, taking into account the balance of positive and negative effects on the underlying legal values.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCMP 180/2005 should be stated as: "When both a common mistake regarding the title (i*) and the absence of good title (m) are present, the court should decide that the contract is voidable (o)." Omitting the absence of good title (m) from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence (q) of undermining the stability and predictability of commercial transactions. Specifically, it would allow parties to rescind contracts based on subjective valuations and expert opinions obtained after the fact, leading to increased litigation and uncertainty in the market. Indeed, the opinion in HCMP 180/2005 explicitly states that the absence of good title was crucial to their decision, as it directly impacted the Purchaser's ability to use the property and the risk of enforcement action by the Government.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCMP 180/2005 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence (u) of a Purchaser acquiring a property with defective title, which could lead to significant legal and practical difficulties, including the risk of enforcement action by the Government. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence occurring because the issue is not about the title to the stained glass panel but rather its authenticity and value. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—protecting against defective title—is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should consider whether the mistake about the panel's authenticity and value is so fundamental that it renders the contract voidable, taking into account the balance of positive and negative effects on the underlying legal values.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of **good title**, which was present in the precedent case HCMP 180/2005, requiring this factor for all similar cases of common mistake would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would mean that parties could only void contracts based on common mistakes if there were issues with the title, thereby limiting the applicability of the doctrine of common mistake to a narrow set of circumstances. Conversely, not requiring the factor of **good title** would allow for a broader application of the doctrine of common mistake, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and equity in contract law. This approach ensures that parties are not unfairly bound by contracts based on fundamental misapprehensions about the subject matter, whether those misapprehensions pertain to title, authenticity, or value.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of **good title**, which was present in HCMP 180/2005, we have the additional factor of **authenticity and value**. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of a common mistake, serves a similar function to **good title** in the precedent case. The presence of **authenticity and value** is crucial because it directly impacts the fundamental nature of the contract and the expectations of the parties. Given the presence of this factor, we submit that the reasoning in HCMP 180/2005 still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values—such as fairness, equity, and the protection of legitimate expectations—would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. Therefore, the contract between Reah and Felicity should be considered voidable due to the common mistake regarding the stained glass panel's authenticity and value.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCMP 180/2005, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of a common mistake regarding a fundamental aspect of the contract and the implied warranty of the subject matter. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of a title issue and the presence of a mistake about the authenticity and value of the stained glass panel.

The proposed legal rule from HCMP 180/2005, which suggests that a contract is voidable when there is a common mistake regarding the title and the absence of good title, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in the context of our current case where the mistake pertains to authenticity and value rather than title.

We've weighed arguments from both sides. The initial argument by analogy effectively highlights the shared legal concepts and fact patterns, suggesting that the contract should be voidable due to the common mistake. On the other hand, the rebuttal arguments emphasize the importance of the title issue in the precedent case and argue that applying the same rule to our current case could undermine the stability and predictability of commercial transactions.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, equity, and the protection of legitimate expectations, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the contract between Reah and Felicity should be considered voidable due to the common mistake regarding the stained glass panel's authenticity and value. This decision aligns with the legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by ensuring that parties are not unfairly bound by contracts based on fundamental misapprehensions about the subject matter.

Key factors that influenced this outcome include the shared legal concepts of common mistake and implied warranty, the significant impact of the mistake on the nature of the contract, and the broader implications for fairness and equity in contractual dealings. Therefore, Reah should not be compelled to proceed with the contract, as the mistake about the panel's authenticity and value is fundamental and renders the contract voidable.


# Contract Law: Whether there is any estoppel preventing Felicity from denying the quality of the stained glass panel

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 16 Subsection 3 and Section 16 Subsection 2

### Major Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 16 Subsection 3

   Conditions:
   - The seller sells goods in the course of a business
   - The buyer, expressly or by implication, makes known to the seller any particular purpose for which the goods are being bought
   - The circumstances do not show that the buyer does not rely, or that it is unreasonable for him to rely, on the seller's skill or judgment

   Consequences:
   - There is an implied condition that the goods supplied under the contract are reasonably fit for that purpose, whether or not that is a purpose for which such goods are commonly supplied

   Exceptions:
   - The circumstances show that the buyer does not rely, or that it is unreasonable for him to rely, on the seller's skill or judgment

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 16 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - The seller sells goods in the course of a business
   - The goods supplied under the contract are of merchantable quality

   Consequences:
   - There is an implied condition that the goods supplied under the contract are of merchantable quality

   Exceptions:
   - The defects are specifically drawn to the buyer's attention before the contract is made
   - The buyer examines the goods before the contract is made, as regards defects which that examination ought to reveal
   - The contract is a contract for sale by sample, as regards defects which would have been apparent on a reasonable examination of the sample

### Minor Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 16 Subsection 3:
- Felicity is not selling goods in the course of a business; she is selling inherited items from her father's studio.
- Reah did not make known to Felicity any particular purpose for which the stained glass panel was being bought.
- The circumstances do not indicate that Reah relied on Felicity's skill or judgment regarding the quality or authenticity of the stained glass panel.

   Therefore, this section does not apply.

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 16 Subsection 2:
- Felicity is not selling goods in the course of a business; she is selling inherited items from her father's studio.
- The stained glass panel was not sold with any implied condition of merchantable quality, as Felicity did not represent herself as a business seller.

   Therefore, this section does not apply.

### Conclusion:

Neither Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 16 Subsection 3 nor Section 16 Subsection 2 applies, as Felicity is not selling goods in the course of a business and there were no implied conditions regarding the quality or purpose of the stained glass panel. Reah does not have a legal basis under these sections to avoid the contract based on the doctrine of mistake.

- Reah and Felicity have entered into a contract for the sale of a stained glass panel.
- Reah believed she was purchasing an original work by Clarky, but it was actually a piece created by Clarky's evening beginner class students.
- This constitutes a unilateral mistake where Reah had a mistaken belief about the quality and origin of the stained glass panel, and Felicity did not know about this mistaken belief.
- The mistake is about the quality and origin of the stained glass panel, not about whether the document correctly reflects the terms previously agreed.
- Therefore, the court may refuse to allow Reah to enforce the contract as it would ordinarily be construed, or rectify the written agreement to give effect to what Reah thought had been agreed.

### Conclusion:

Kowloon Development Finance Limited v Pendex Industries Limited applies, and the court may refuse to allow Reah to enforce the contract as it would ordinarily be construed, or rectify the written agreement to give effect to what Reah thought had been agreed.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCMP 180/2005)
In the case of HCMP 180/2005 BETWEEN TONY INVESTMENTS LIMITED (德隆投資有限公司) Plaintiff and FUNG SUN KWAN BERNARD (馮燊均) (alias FUNG SUN KWAN) trading as KWONG YEE WOO (SHIPBUILDING CONTRACTORS) Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the Vendor had no title to the Former Slipway and that the Purchaser's requisitions were reasonable. The Vendor failed to show good title, and the Purchaser was entitled to specific performance and damages. The court also dismissed the Vendor's defence of common mistake, holding that the mistake did not render the contract void.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCMP 180/2005 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Good Title**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Vendor was required to show good title to the property being sold. Similarly, in our current case, Felicity must have good title to the stained glass panel she is selling to Reah.
- **Legal Concept 2: Misrepresentation**: In HCMP 180/2005, there was a misapprehension about the Vendor's rights over the Former Slipway. In our current case, there is a misapprehension about the value and origin of the stained glass panel.
- **Legal Concept 3: Common Mistake**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Vendor argued that there was a common mistake regarding the rights over the Former Slipway. In our current case, Reah believes there is a common mistake regarding the value and origin of the stained glass panel.
- **Legal Concept 4: Specific Performance**: In HCMP 180/2005, the court considered whether specific performance was an appropriate remedy. In our current case, Reah is questioning whether she must proceed with the contract, which involves the concept of specific performance.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCMP 180/2005)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a common mistake regarding the quality or value of the subject matter of a contract, the court should decide whether the mistake is fundamental enough to render the contract void. This rule was justified in HCMP 180/2005 because the court found that the Vendor's misapprehension about the title did not make the contract fundamentally different from what the parties had agreed upon. The positive effects (E+) of this outcome include upholding the integrity of contractual agreements and ensuring that parties cannot easily escape their contractual obligations due to misunderstandings that do not go to the root of the contract. The negative effects (E-) are minimal in this case, as the Vendor had a clear path to remedy the title issue by seeking a re-grant from the Government.

Applying this rule to our current case, Reah's misapprehension about the value and origin of the stained glass panel does not fundamentally alter the nature of the contract. The subject matter of the contract (the stained glass panel) still exists, and the mistake does not make the performance of the contract impossible. Therefore, Reah may not be able to void the contract based on the doctrine of common mistake, and she may still be required to proceed with the purchase or seek an alternative remedy such as damages.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCMP 180/2005) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Good Title**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Vendor was required to show good title to the property being sold. Similarly, in our current case, Felicity must have good title to the stained glass panel she is selling to Reah.
- **Legal Concept 2: Misrepresentation**: In HCMP 180/2005, there was a misapprehension about the Vendor's rights over the Former Slipway. In our current case, there is a misapprehension about the value and origin of the stained glass panel.
- **Legal Concept 3: Common Mistake**: In HCMP 180/2005, the Vendor argued that there was a common mistake regarding the rights over the Former Slipway. In our current case, Reah believes there is a common mistake regarding the value and origin of the stained glass panel.
- **Legal Concept 4: Specific Performance**: In HCMP 180/2005, the court considered whether specific performance was an appropriate remedy. In our current case, Reah is questioning whether she must proceed with the contract, which involves the concept of specific performance.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCMP 180/2005, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Contractual Integrity**: Enforcing the contract despite the mistake ensures that parties cannot easily escape their contractual obligations due to misunderstandings that do not go to the root of the contract. This upholds the principle that contracts are binding agreements that should be honored.

2. **Encouraging Due Diligence**: By holding Reah to the contract, the court would encourage parties to conduct thorough due diligence before entering into agreements. This promotes careful and informed decision-making in commercial transactions.

3. **Providing Clear Legal Precedent**: Consistency in legal rulings provides clear guidance to future parties in similar situations. This helps in reducing litigation by setting a clear standard for what constitutes a fundamental mistake that can void a contract.

4. **Equitable Remedies**: While specific performance may not be appropriate if the mistake fundamentally alters the nature of the contract, the court can still provide alternative remedies such as damages. This ensures that the aggrieved party is compensated without unjustly enriching the other party.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCMP 180/2005, it would have the positive effects of upholding contractual integrity, encouraging due diligence, providing clear legal precedent, and ensuring equitable remedies.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCMP 180/2005, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the Vendor had a clear path to remedy the title issue by seeking a re-grant from the Government. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—upholding contractual integrity and encouraging due diligence—outweighed any potential drawbacks because the Vendor had a contractual right to seek a re-grant, making the performance of the contract possible. However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as Felicity does not have a similar clear path to remedy the misapprehension about the value and origin of the stained glass panel. There is no equivalent mechanism for Felicity to "correct" the value or origin of the artwork, making the situation fundamentally different.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—Reah's reliance on the specialist valuer's assessment—that was not present in HCMP 180/2005. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because Reah's decision to purchase the stained glass panel was based on a fundamental assumption about its value and origin, which was later proven to be incorrect. Due to this reliance on expert valuation, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as undermining the reliance on expert opinions in commercial transactions, than positive ones, unlike in HCMP 180/2005. In the precedent case, the Vendor had a clear path to remedy the title issue, whereas in our current case, the misapprehension about the artwork's value and origin cannot be easily remedied, making the contract fundamentally different from what the parties had agreed upon.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCMP 180/2005 should be stated as "When both a common mistake regarding the quality or value of the subject matter of a contract and a clear path to remedy the mistake are present, the court should decide that the contract is not void and enforce specific performance." Omitting the clear path to remedy the mistake from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of parties being forced to proceed with contracts that are fundamentally different from what they believed they were agreeing to, without any feasible way to rectify the situation. Indeed, the opinion in HCMP 180/2005 explicitly states that the Vendor's ability to seek a re-grant from the Government was crucial to their decision, as it provided a clear mechanism to remedy the title issue and uphold the contract.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCMP 180/2005 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of parties escaping their contractual obligations due to misunderstandings that do not go to the root of the contract, especially when there is a clear path to remedy the mistake. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because Felicity does not have a similar clear path to remedy the misapprehension about the value and origin of the stained glass panel. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should consider the fundamental nature of the mistake and the lack of a feasible remedy, which makes the contract fundamentally different from what the parties had agreed upon.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the clear path to remedy the mistake (factor m), which was present in the precedent case HCMP 180/2005, requiring this factor for all similar cases of common mistake would lead to the undesirable consequence of parties being forced to proceed with contracts that are fundamentally different from what they believed they were agreeing to, without any feasible way to rectify the situation. Conversely, not requiring a clear path to remedy the mistake would allow for a more equitable outcome, where parties are not unjustly bound to contracts that are fundamentally different from their original understanding. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which aim to ensure fairness and mutual understanding in contractual agreements.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the clear path to remedy the mistake (factor m), which was present in HCMP 180/2005, we have the additional factor of reliance on expert valuation (factor n). This reliance on expert valuation, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of a common mistake regarding the quality or value of the subject matter, serves a similar function to the clear path to remedy the mistake in the precedent case. Given the presence of reliance on expert valuation, we submit that the reasoning in HCMP 180/2005 still applies, as the positive effects on ensuring fairness and mutual understanding in contractual agreements would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCMP 180/2005, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of a common mistake regarding the quality or value of the subject matter and the need to determine whether this mistake is fundamental enough to render the contract void. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of a clear path to remedy the mistake in the current case, which was a crucial factor in the precedent.

The proposed legal rule from HCMP 180/2005, which states that a contract is not void and specific performance should be enforced when there is a common mistake and a clear path to remedy the mistake, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in situations where no such clear path exists.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that upholding contractual integrity and encouraging due diligence are essential (as argued in favor of applying the precedent) and the counterpoint that forcing parties to proceed with fundamentally different contracts without a feasible remedy would be unjust (as argued in the rebuttal).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, mutual understanding in contractual agreements, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the absence of a clear path to remedy the mistake in the current case makes it fundamentally different from the precedent. Therefore, Reah should not be bound to proceed with the contract under the doctrine of common mistake, as the mistake regarding the value and origin of the stained glass panel is fundamental and cannot be easily remedied.

This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by ensuring that parties are not unjustly bound to contracts that are fundamentally different from their original understanding. The key factors influencing this outcome include the lack of a feasible remedy for the mistake and the reliance on expert valuation, which significantly alters the nature of the contract.
