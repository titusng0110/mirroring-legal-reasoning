### Legal Analysis of the Scenario

#### 1. Identification of Legal Issues

The primary legal issue in this scenario is whether Reah can rescind the contract for the purchase of the stained glass panel on the grounds of mistake. Specifically, the issues to consider are:

1. **Mistake as to the Quality of the Subject Matter**: Whether the mistake regarding the origin and value of the stained glass panel constitutes a mistake that would allow Reah to rescind the contract.
2. **Mutual Mistake**: Whether both parties were mistaken about the nature of the stained glass panel.
3. **Unilateral Mistake**: Whether only Reah was mistaken and whether this mistake is sufficient to void the contract.

#### 2. Applicable Laws

The relevant legal principles in this scenario are derived from the common law doctrine of mistake, which is applicable in Hong Kong. The key types of mistake to consider are:

1. **Common Mistake**: Both parties make the same mistake regarding a fundamental fact.
2. **Mutual Mistake**: Both parties are mistaken but about different facts.
3. **Unilateral Mistake**: Only one party is mistaken, and the other party is aware of the mistake.

Relevant case law includes:

- **Bell v Lever Brothers Ltd [1932] AC 161**: Establishes that a common mistake must be fundamental to the contract.
- **Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd [2002] EWCA Civ 1407**: Reinforces that a common mistake must render the contract impossible to perform.
- **Smith v Hughes (1871) LR 6 QB 597**: Discusses unilateral mistake and the importance of the mistaken party's knowledge.
- **Solle v Butcher [1950] 1 KB 671**: Addresses equitable relief for mistake, though its authority has been questioned post-Great Peace.

#### 3. Application of Law to Facts

**Common Mistake**:
- For a common mistake to void a contract, the mistake must be fundamental. In this case, both Felicity and Reah believed the stained glass panel was created by Clarky, which significantly affects its value.
- However, the mistake does not render the contract impossible to perform; it merely affects the value of the subject matter. According to **Bell v Lever Brothers**, this may not be sufficient to void the contract.

**Mutual Mistake**:
- If both parties were mistaken about the origin of the stained glass panel, this could be a mutual mistake. However, mutual mistake typically involves both parties being mistaken about different facts, which does not seem to be the case here.

**Unilateral Mistake**:
- If only Reah was mistaken about the origin of the panel, this would be a unilateral mistake. According to **Smith v Hughes**, if Felicity was aware of Reah's mistake and did not correct it, Reah might have grounds to rescind the contract.
- There is no indication that Felicity knew the panel was not created by Clarky, so it is unlikely that Reah can rely on unilateral mistake to void the contract.

**Equitable Relief**:
- Under **Solle v Butcher**, equitable relief might be available if the mistake is significant and it would be unjust to enforce the contract. However, the authority of this case has been questioned, and it is uncertain whether a court would grant relief on this basis.

#### Conclusion

Reah's ability to rescind the contract on the grounds of mistake is limited. The mistake regarding the origin and value of the stained glass panel does not appear to be fundamental enough to void the contract under common law principles. Additionally, there is no evidence that Felicity was aware of Reah's mistake, which weakens the argument for unilateral mistake. While equitable relief might be a possibility, it is uncertain and would depend on the court's discretion.

Reah may have to proceed with the contract unless she can negotiate a resolution with Felicity or find additional evidence to support a claim of mistake.
