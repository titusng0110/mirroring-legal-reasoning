### Legal Analysis of the Scenario

#### 1. Identification of Legal Issues

The primary legal issue in this scenario is whether Reah can avoid the contract for the purchase of the stained glass panel on the grounds of mistake. Specifically, the issues are:
- Whether there was a mistake as to the quality or nature of the subject matter of the contract.
- Whether the mistake was mutual or unilateral.
- Whether the mistake was fundamental enough to render the contract void or voidable.

#### 2. Applicable Laws

The relevant legal principles and laws applicable to this scenario include:
- The doctrine of mistake in contract law, particularly common mistake and unilateral mistake.
- Relevant case law, such as *Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd* [2003] QB 679 and *Bell v Lever Brothers Ltd* [1932] AC 161.
- The Sale of Goods Ordinance (Cap. 26), particularly sections related to the effect of mistake on contracts.

#### 3. Application of Law to Facts

##### Doctrine of Mistake

**Common Mistake:**
A common mistake occurs when both parties to a contract share the same erroneous belief regarding a fundamental fact that is central to the contract. For a common mistake to render a contract void, the mistake must be so fundamental that it makes the performance of the contract impossible or the subject matter essentially different from what was contemplated by the parties.

In *Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd*, the court held that for a common mistake to void a contract, the following elements must be present:
1. There must be a common assumption as to the existence of a state of affairs.
2. There must be no warranty by either party that that state of affairs exists.
3. The non-existence of the state of affairs must not be attributable to the fault of either party.
4. The non-existence of the state of affairs must render performance of the contract impossible.
5. The state of affairs may be the existence, or a vital attribute, of the consideration to be provided or circumstances which must subsist if performance of the contractual adventure is to be possible.

In this scenario, both Reah and Felicity believed that the stained glass panel was an original work by Clarky, which significantly influenced the value of the piece. This belief was fundamental to the contract as it directly affected the price agreed upon.

**Unilateral Mistake:**
A unilateral mistake occurs when only one party is mistaken about a fundamental aspect of the contract, and the other party is aware of the mistake. If the non-mistaken party knows or ought to have known about the mistake, the contract may be voidable.

In *Hartog v Colin & Shields* [1939] 3 All ER 566, the court held that a contract could be voided if one party knew that the other party was mistaken about a fundamental term of the contract.

In this case, there is no indication that Felicity knew or ought to have known that the panel was not an original work by Clarky. Therefore, the doctrine of unilateral mistake may not apply unless it can be shown that Felicity had reason to believe that Reah was mistaken about the nature of the panel.

##### Sale of Goods Ordinance (Cap. 26)

Section 62(2) of the Sale of Goods Ordinance states that the rules of common law, including those relating to mistake, continue to apply to contracts for the sale of goods unless they are inconsistent with the express provisions of the Ordinance.

#### Conclusion

Based on the doctrine of common mistake, Reah may have grounds to argue that the contract is void due to a fundamental mistake shared by both parties regarding the nature and value of the stained glass panel. The mistake was central to the contract as it directly influenced the agreed price. If the court finds that the mistake was indeed fundamental and rendered the contract essentially different from what was contemplated, Reah may be able to avoid the contract.

However, if the court finds that the mistake was not fundamental enough to void the contract, Reah may still be bound by the terms of the contract. In such a case, Reah may need to explore other potential remedies, such as negotiating with Felicity for a reduction in price or seeking rescission of the contract on other grounds, such as misrepresentation if any can be established.

Reah should seek legal advice to explore these options and determine the best course of action based on the specific facts and evidence available.
