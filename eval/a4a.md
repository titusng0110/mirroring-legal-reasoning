   - **Doctrine of Consideration:** Whether the demand for additional payment constitutes valid consideration.

#### 3. Application of Law to Facts

1. **Payment to the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union:**

   - **Economic Duress:** The Union's demand for payment under the threat of stopping goods can be seen as economic duress. In the case of **Pao On v Lau Yiu Long [1980] AC 614**, the Privy Council held that economic duress involves illegitimate pressure which compels a party to enter into a contract. Here, the Union's actions were unlawful and constituted illegitimate pressure.
   - **Conversion:** The Union's interference with the goods could be seen as conversion, as they wrongfully exercised control over LN Ltd's property. In **Kuwait Airways Corp v Iraqi Airways Co (Nos 4 and 5) [2002] 2 AC 883**, the House of Lords held that conversion involves dealing with goods in a manner inconsistent with the owner's rights.
   - **Recovery of Payments:** Given the unlawful nature of the Union's actions, LN Ltd may have a claim to recover the £30,000 under the tort of economic duress and conversion.

2. **Payment to DSTR Ltd:**

   - **Economic Duress:** DSTR Ltd's demand for an immediate increase in haulage rates under the threat of ceasing delivery may constitute economic duress. In **Atlas Express Ltd v Kafco (Importers and Distributors) Ltd [1989] QB 833**, the court held that a contract entered into under economic duress is voidable.
   - **Contractual Terms:** The original contract with DSTR Ltd did not include a price variation clause. The demand for increased rates without a contractual basis may be unenforceable.
   - **Recovery of Payments:** LN Ltd may argue that the £50,000 was paid under economic duress and seek to recover it. However, they must demonstrate that they had no practical alternative but to agree to the increased rates.

3. **Payment to Gloop plc:**

   - **Contractual Obligation:** The original contract terms with Gloop plc need to be examined to determine if there is any obligation for LN Ltd to cover testing costs. If there is no such clause, Gloop plc's demand may be unenforceable.
   - **Consideration:** For Gloop plc's demand to be enforceable, there must be valid consideration. In **Williams v Roffey Bros & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd [1991] 1 QB 1**, the Court of Appeal held that a promise to pay more for the same performance requires fresh consideration.
   - **Credit Terms:** Gloop plc's threat to cease offering credit may be seen as a form of economic duress. LN Ltd can argue that the demand for additional payment lacks consideration and is not binding.

### Conclusion

- **Payment to the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union:** LN Ltd has a strong case to recover the £30,000 paid under economic duress and conversion.
- **Payment to DSTR Ltd:** LN Ltd may seek to recover the £50,000 paid under economic duress, but they must demonstrate that they had no practical alternative.
- **Payment to Gloop plc:** LN Ltd is not bound to pay the £5,000 per annum for testing costs unless there is a contractual obligation or valid consideration. They can challenge the demand based on the lack of consideration and potential economic duress.

LN Ltd should seek legal advice to pursue claims for recovery of payments and to negotiate terms with Gloop plc.
