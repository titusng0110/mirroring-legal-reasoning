   - Case law: *Hiromori International Ltd v Gold Ocean Enterprises Ltd* (HCA1015/2004), *Hin Fai Ltd v Longrace Development Ltd* (HCA001788/2003).

2. **Economic Duress:**
   - Doctrine of economic duress in contract law.
   - Case law: *Pao On v Lau Yiu Long* [1980] AC 614, *The Universal Sentinel* [1983] AC 367, *Esquire (Electronics) Ltd v HSBC* [2007] 3 HKLRD 439.

#### 3. Application of Law to Facts

1. **Wrongful Interference with Goods by the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union:**
   - **Legal Principle:** The tort of wrongful interference with goods occurs when there is an unlawful interference with the possession of goods.
   - **Case Law:** In *Hiromori International Ltd v Gold Ocean Enterprises Ltd*, the court held that wrongful interference with goods by the seller after property has passed to the purchaser constitutes a breach of the implied term of quiet possession.
   - **Application:** The Union’s actions constitute wrongful interference with LN Ltd’s goods. LN Ltd was compelled to pay £30,000 under duress to avoid further delays. This payment was not voluntary but made under immediate necessity to preserve their business operations.
   - **Conclusion:** LN Ltd can potentially recover the £30,000 paid to the Union as it was made under duress and constitutes wrongful interference with goods.

2. **Demand for Increased Haulage Rates by DSTR Ltd:**
   - **Legal Principle:** Economic duress occurs when one party is forced to enter into a contract or make a payment due to illegitimate pressure exerted by another party.
   - **Case Law:** In *Pao On v Lau Yiu Long*, the Privy Council held that economic duress renders a contract voidable if the pressure applied is illegitimate and leaves the victim with no practical alternative.
   - **Application:** DSTR Ltd’s demand for a 20% increase in haulage rates, under the threat of ceasing delivery, constitutes economic duress. LN Ltd had no practical alternative but to agree to the increased rates to ensure the continuation of their business operations.
   - **Conclusion:** LN Ltd can potentially recover the £50,000 paid to DSTR Ltd as it was made under economic duress.

3. **Demand for Testing Costs by Gloop plc:**
   - **Legal Principle:** A variation to a contract requires mutual consent and consideration. Additional obligations imposed unilaterally by one party are not binding unless agreed upon by the other party.
   - **Case Law:** In *Lee Po Nin v Kwok Lin Hing*, the court emphasized the importance of mutual consent in contract variations.
   - **Application:** Gloop plc’s demand for £5,000 per annum for testing costs constitutes a variation to the original contract. LN Ltd is not contractually bound to pay these costs unless they agree to the variation. The threat to cease offering credit does not constitute a legal obligation for LN Ltd to pay the testing costs.
   - **Conclusion:** LN Ltd is not bound to pay the £5,000 per annum for testing costs unless they agree to the variation. They can refuse to pay and negotiate the terms or find an alternative supplier.

### Conclusion

LN Ltd has strong legal grounds to recover the £30,000 paid to the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union and the £50,000 paid to DSTR Ltd, as both payments were made under duress. LN Ltd is not contractually bound to pay the £5,000 per annum for testing costs demanded by Gloop plc unless they agree to the variation. LN Ltd should seek legal recourse to recover the payments made under duress and negotiate the terms with Gloop plc regarding the testing costs.
