### Relevant law:

Malcolm Ernest Gray v Diane Cary Barber Servino

### Major Premise:

1. Malcolm Ernest Gray v Diane Cary Barber Servino

   Conditions:
   - A party claims that they consented to an agreement under duress
   - The alleged duress includes pressure or threats that are unlawful or illegitimate
   - The party was under considerable pressure from financial difficulties
   - The agreement was made after negotiations with each party having the benefit of independent legal advice

   Consequences:
   - The agreement is not voidable on the ground of duress

   Exceptions:
   - There is evidence pointing to the agreement having been the result of exploitation of disparity in bargaining power
   - The terms of the agreement are so unjust as to suggest duress

### Minor Premise:

1. Payment to the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union:
   - LN Ltd claims that they consented to the payment under duress.
   - The duress includes unlawful interference with goods by the Union.
   - LN Ltd was under considerable financial pressure due to the £30,000 cost incurred over three months.
   - There is no indication that the payment was made after negotiations with independent legal advice.

   Therefore, the conditions are partially satisfied, but the lack of independent legal advice means the agreement might still be voidable on the ground of duress.

2. Payment to DSTR Ltd:
   - LN Ltd claims that they consented to the payment under duress.
   - The duress includes the threat of ceasing delivery, which would disrupt LN Ltd's operations.
   - LN Ltd was under considerable financial pressure due to increased insurance costs and the need to fulfill a lucrative contract.
   - There is no indication that the payment was made after negotiations with independent legal advice.

   Therefore, the conditions are partially satisfied, but the lack of independent legal advice means the agreement might still be voidable on the ground of duress.

3. Agreement with Gloop plc:
   - LN Ltd claims that they consented to the payment under duress.
   - The duress includes the threat of ceasing to offer credit on orders.
   - LN Ltd was under considerable financial pressure due to the need to comply with new regulatory requirements.
   - There is no indication that the agreement was made after negotiations with independent legal advice.

   Therefore, the conditions are partially satisfied, but the lack of independent legal advice means the agreement might still be voidable on the ground of duress.

### Conclusion:

1. Payment to the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union:
   - The payment can potentially be recovered as it was made under duress, and the lack of independent legal advice means the agreement might still be voidable.

2. Payment to DSTR Ltd:
   - The payment can potentially be recovered as it was made under duress, and the lack of independent legal advice means the agreement might still be voidable.

3. Agreement with Gloop plc:
   - LN Ltd is not bound to pay for the testing as the agreement might still be voidable on the ground of duress due to the lack of independent legal advice.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum)

In the case of Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum (precedent p), the plaintiff, Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited, sought to recover a sum of HK$2,869,533.60 from the defendant, Wong Cheung Sum, based on cheques that were dishonoured. The defendant claimed that the cheques were given under duress, alleging threats of violence by the plaintiff's representative. The court ruled that the defendant's story was implausible and that there was no credible defence of duress. Consequently, the court allowed the plaintiff's appeal, set aside the judge's order giving the defendant unconditional leave to defend, and restored the master's order in favour of the plaintiff (outcome o).

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Duress**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the defendants claimed that they were coerced into making payments or providing cheques due to threats. In Chu Kong, the defendant alleged threats of violence, while in the current case, LN Ltd felt compelled to pay the Union due to the wrongful interference with their goods.

- **Legal Concept 2: Economic Duress**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: Both cases involve economic pressure. In Chu Kong, the defendant claimed economic duress due to threats affecting his business. In the current case, LN Ltd faced economic duress from DSTR Ltd's demand for increased haulage rates under the threat of ceasing delivery.

- **Legal Concept 3: Voluntariness of Consent**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: The issue of whether the payments or cheques were given voluntarily is central to both cases. In Chu Kong, the court examined whether the defendant's will was overborne by threats. Similarly, in the current case, LN Ltd's consent to pay the Union and DSTR Ltd is questioned due to the pressure they faced.

- **Legal Concept 4: Recovery of Payments Made Under Duress**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: Both cases deal with the possibility of recovering payments made under duress. In Chu Kong, the court ruled that the payments were not made under duress and thus could not be recovered. In the current case, LN Ltd seeks to recover the payments made to the Union and DSTR Ltd.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of alleged duress involving threats or economic pressure (fact pattern i*), the court should decide whether the payments or cheques were given voluntarily and whether the defence of duress is credible (outcome o). This rule was justified in Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum because the court found that the defendant's allegations of duress were implausible and unsupported by evidence, thereby upholding the principle that payments made voluntarily, even under pressure, cannot be recovered unless the duress is credible and substantiated.

In the current case, LN Ltd can argue that the payments made to the Union and DSTR Ltd were under duress. However, they must provide credible evidence that their will was overborne by the threats or economic pressure, similar to the scrutiny applied in Chu Kong. If LN Ltd can demonstrate that the payments were not made voluntarily and were a result of illegitimate pressure, they may have a basis to recover the payments. Conversely, if the court finds the duress claims implausible or unsupported, as in Chu Kong, LN Ltd may not be able to recover the payments.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Duress**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: LN Ltd felt compelled to pay the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union due to the wrongful interference with their goods, similar to the defendant in Chu Kong who claimed he was coerced into providing cheques due to threats.

- **Legal Concept 2: Economic Duress**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: LN Ltd faced economic pressure from DSTR Ltd's demand for increased haulage rates under the threat of ceasing delivery, akin to the economic duress claimed by the defendant in Chu Kong.

- **Legal Concept 3: Voluntariness of Consent**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: The issue of whether LN Ltd's payments to the Union and DSTR Ltd were made voluntarily is central to the case, similar to the scrutiny of voluntariness in Chu Kong.

- **Legal Concept 4: Recovery of Payments Made Under Duress**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: LN Ltd seeks to recover the payments made to the Union and DSTR Ltd, paralleling the plaintiff's attempt to recover payments in Chu Kong.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum. This decision would be justified because, as in Chu Kong, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding the Integrity of Contractual Agreements**: By scrutinizing the claims of duress and ensuring that only credible and substantiated claims are accepted, the court would maintain the integrity of contractual agreements. This prevents parties from easily escaping their contractual obligations by alleging duress without solid evidence.

2. **Deterring Unsubstantiated Claims**: A decision consistent with Chu Kong would deter parties from making unsubstantiated claims of duress. This would promote a more stable and predictable business environment, where parties can rely on the enforceability of their agreements.

3. **Encouraging Proper Legal Remedies**: By requiring credible evidence of duress, the court encourages parties to seek proper legal remedies, such as reporting threats to the police or seeking immediate legal advice, rather than acquiescing to demands and later claiming duress.

4. **Balancing Economic Pressures**: Recognizing economic duress only when it is substantiated ensures that businesses cannot exploit temporary economic pressures to renegotiate contracts unfairly. This maintains a fair balance in commercial relationships.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum. This decision would be justified because it would uphold the principles of contract law, deter unsubstantiated claims, encourage proper legal remedies, and balance economic pressures in commercial relationships.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, **the nature of the threats and the context in which they were made**, that was not present in **Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of alleged duress.

In **Chu Kong**, the court found the defendant's story of physical threats implausible and unsupported by evidence. The threats were alleged to have been made in a highly dramatic and violent manner, which the court found difficult to believe without corroboration. The court also noted that the defendant did not take immediate steps to report the threats or stop the cheques, which further undermined the credibility of the duress claim.

In contrast, in our current case, the duress faced by LN Ltd from the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union and DSTR Ltd involves **economic duress** rather than physical threats. The Union's actions of stopping goods and demanding payments, and DSTR Ltd's threat to cease delivery unless haulage rates were increased, are forms of economic pressure that are more subtle and pervasive. These actions directly impacted LN Ltd's business operations and created a situation where LN Ltd felt they had no practical alternative but to comply with the demands to avoid significant business disruption.

Because of this difference in the nature and context of the threats, applying the same outcome as in **Chu Kong** would have more negative consequences in our case. Specifically, it would:

1. **Undermine Business Stability**: Recognizing only physical threats as duress and not economic pressure would leave businesses vulnerable to coercive economic tactics, undermining the stability and predictability of commercial operations.
2. **Encourage Unlawful Economic Pressure**: It would potentially encourage parties to use economic pressure tactics, knowing that such actions might not be considered duress, thereby promoting unfair business practices.
3. **Fail to Address Modern Commercial Realities**: The modern business environment often involves complex economic relationships where economic duress can be as coercive as physical threats. Ignoring this reality would render the law out of touch with current commercial practices.

Therefore, due to the presence of economic duress in our current case, which was not a factor in **Chu Kong**, applying the same outcome would have more negative consequences than positive ones. The court should recognize the economic duress faced by LN Ltd and allow for the recovery of the payments made under such pressure.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from **Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum** should be stated as: "When both [i*] (alleged duress involving threats or economic pressure) and [m] (credible evidence of economic duress and the context of modern commercial realities) are present, the court should decide [o] (allowing the recovery of payments made under duress)." Omitting [m] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q] (leaving businesses vulnerable to coercive economic tactics and promoting unfair business practices).

Indeed, the opinion in **Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum** explicitly states that the credibility of the duress claim was crucial to their decision. The court found the defendant's story of physical threats implausible and unsupported by evidence, which was a significant factor in rejecting the duress claim. This highlights the importance of credible evidence in determining the presence of duress.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in **Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum** was clearly designed to prevent [undesirable consequence u] (unsubstantiated claims of duress undermining the integrity of contractual agreements). However, in our current case, there's no risk of [u] occurring because LN Ltd's claims of economic duress are supported by the context of modern commercial realities and the specific economic pressures they faced.

Therefore, applying the precedent's rule strictly without considering the context of economic duress in our current case would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves (preventing unsubstantiated claims) is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should recognize the economic duress faced by LN Ltd and allow for the recovery of the payments made under such pressure.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of **physical threats** (factor m), which was present in the precedent case **Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of **alleged duress involving threats or economic pressure (fact pattern i*)** would lead to undesirable consequences. Specifically, it would leave businesses vulnerable to coercive economic tactics and promote unfair business practices. Conversely, not requiring **physical threats** would allow for the recognition of **economic duress**, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, such as ensuring fairness in contractual relationships and protecting parties from illegitimate pressure.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks **physical threats** (factor m), which was present in **Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum**, we have the additional factor of **economic duress** (factor n). This **economic duress**, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of **alleged duress involving threats or economic pressure (fact pattern i*)**, serves a similar function to **physical threats** in the precedent case. Given the presence of **economic duress**, we submit that the reasoning in **Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum** still applies, as the positive effects on **legal values such as fairness, protection from illegitimate pressure, and maintaining the integrity of contractual agreements** would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of alleged duress involving threats or economic pressure and the issue of voluntariness of consent. However, it also differs significantly in the nature of the duress, with the current case involving economic duress rather than physical threats.

The proposed legal rule of "When both [i*] (alleged duress involving threats or economic pressure) and [m] (credible evidence of economic duress and the context of modern commercial realities) are present, the court should decide [o] (allowing the recovery of payments made under duress)" finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of credible evidence in establishing duress (as emphasized in **Chu Kong**) and the need to recognize economic duress in modern commercial contexts (as argued in the current case).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, protection from illegitimate pressure, and maintaining the integrity of contractual agreements, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that LN Ltd should be allowed to recover the payments made to the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union and DSTR Ltd. This decision is justified because it acknowledges the reality of economic duress in modern commercial transactions and ensures that businesses are protected from coercive economic tactics, thereby promoting fair and stable commercial relationships.

Key factors that influenced this outcome include the credible evidence of economic pressure faced by LN Ltd, the context of modern commercial realities where economic duress can be as coercive as physical threats, and the need to uphold the principles of fairness and protection from illegitimate pressure in contractual agreements.


# Contract Law: Whether the actions of the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union constitute economic duress

- LN Ltd has paid £30,000 to the Union to ensure the continuation of deliveries.
- The sums paid to the Union were incurred before the time of discharge in the performance of the contract.
- Therefore, LN Ltd may recover the sums paid to the Union as money received by the Union for the use of LN Ltd, unless the court considers it just to allow the Union to retain the sums due to expenses incurred.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3 and 5:
- LN Ltd entered into a contract with DSTR Ltd for the delivery of nitrocellulose.

### Major Premise:

1. Malcolm Ernest Gray v Diane Cary Barber Servino

   Conditions:
   - A party claims that they consented to an agreement under duress.
   - The duress involves pressure that is illegitimate or unlawful.
   - The pressure was a significant cause inducing the party to enter into the agreement.

   Consequences:
   - The agreement may be set aside or deemed voidable.

   Exceptions:
   - The party had independent legal advice.
   - The agreement was entered into voluntarily despite the pressure.
   - The terms of the agreement are not so unjust as to suggest duress.

### Minor Premise:

1. Payment to the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union:
   - LN Ltd claims they consented to the payment under duress.
   - The duress involves pressure that is illegitimate or unlawful (wrongful interference with goods).
   - The pressure was a significant cause inducing LN Ltd to make the payment (£30,000 over three months).

   Exceptions:
   - LN Ltd did not have independent legal advice.
   - LN Ltd did not enter into the agreement voluntarily; they felt powerless to resist.
   - The terms of the payment (equivalent to an administrator’s monthly salary) are unjust and suggest duress.

2. Payment to DSTR Ltd:
   - LN Ltd claims they consented to the increased haulage rates under duress.
   - The duress involves pressure that is illegitimate or unlawful (threat to cease delivery).
   - The pressure was a significant cause inducing LN Ltd to agree to the increased rates and pay £50,000.

   Exceptions:
   - LN Ltd did not have independent legal advice.
   - LN Ltd did not enter into the agreement voluntarily; they reluctantly agreed.
   - The terms of the increased rates (20% increase) are unjust and suggest duress.

3. Agreement with Gloop plc:
   - LN Ltd is being asked to pay £5,000 per annum for testing costs.
   - The pressure involves a threat to cease offering credit on any orders.
   - The pressure was a significant cause inducing LN Ltd to consider the payment.

   Exceptions:
   - LN Ltd can seek independent legal advice.
   - LN Ltd can choose to enter into the agreement voluntarily despite the pressure.
   - The terms of the payment for testing costs may not be so unjust as to suggest duress, as it is a cost associated with regulatory compliance.

### Conclusion:

1. Payment to the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union:
   - The conditions for economic duress are satisfied, and none of the exceptions apply. Therefore, the payment of £30,000 to the Union can be recovered.

2. Payment to DSTR Ltd:
   - The conditions for economic duress are satisfied, and none of the exceptions apply. Therefore, the payment of £50,000 to DSTR Ltd can be recovered.

3. Agreement with Gloop plc:
   - The conditions for economic duress are not fully satisfied, and the exceptions may apply. Therefore, LN Ltd is likely bound to pay for the testing costs unless they can demonstrate that the terms are unjust and suggest duress.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (LKF v. ZTISL)

In the case of LKF v. ZTISL [2024] HKCFI 424; HCSD 8/2023 (31 January 2024) (precedent p), the court ruled that the applicant failed to establish an arguable case for setting aside a statutory demand on the grounds of unconscionable bargain and duress. The court emphasized that for a defence to be substantial under rule 48(5)(b), it must be of substance and not merely arguable. The court also clarified the elements required to establish an unconscionable bargain and economic duress, ultimately finding that the applicant did not meet these requirements.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in LKF v. ZTISL and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Economic Duress**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In LKF v. ZTISL, the applicant alleged that they were forced to sign an agreement under the threat of termination of their working relationship, which they claimed amounted to economic duress. Similarly, in our current case, LN Ltd was compelled to pay additional sums to DSTR Ltd under the threat of ceasing delivery, which they argue constitutes economic duress.

- **Legal Concept 2: Illegitimate Pressure**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In LKF v. ZTISL, the court examined whether the pressure exerted was illegitimate, considering factors such as the nature of the threat and whether the party had any realistic practical alternative. In our current case, LN Ltd faced illegitimate pressure from the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union, who demanded payments to allow goods to pass, and from DSTR Ltd, who demanded increased haulage rates under the threat of ceasing delivery.

- **Legal Concept 3: Affirmation of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In LKF v. ZTISL, the court noted that the applicant had affirmed the contract by continuing to earn commissions under the new agreement. In our current case, LN Ltd continued to pay the increased haulage rates to DSTR Ltd and made payments to the Union, which could be seen as an affirmation of the coerced agreements.

- **Legal Concept 4: Burden of Proof**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In LKF v. ZTISL, the court highlighted that the burden of proof lies on the applicant to provide sufficiently precise factual evidence to support their claims. Similarly, in our current case, LN Ltd must provide evidence to support their claims of economic duress and illegitimate pressure.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (LKF v. ZTISL)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of economic duress and illegitimate pressure, the court should decide that the coerced payments or agreements are voidable and the monies paid can be recovered. This rule was justified in LKF v. ZTISL because the court carefully examined the elements of economic duress and unconscionable bargain, ensuring that only substantial and well-supported claims could succeed. The positive effects (E+) of this outcome include upholding the integrity of contractual agreements and protecting parties from coercive practices, which outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially invalidating agreements that were entered into under duress. 

Therefore, applying this rule to our current case, LN Ltd should be able to recover the monies paid to the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union and DSTR Ltd if they can establish that the payments were made under economic duress and illegitimate pressure. Additionally, LN Ltd should not be bound to pay Gloop plc for the testing costs if they can demonstrate that the demand was made under similar coercive circumstances.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (LKF v. ZTISL) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Economic Duress**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: LN Ltd was compelled to pay additional sums to DSTR Ltd under the threat of ceasing delivery, which they argue constitutes economic duress. This mirrors the situation in LKF v. ZTISL, where the applicant alleged they were forced to sign an agreement under the threat of termination of their working relationship.

- **Legal Concept 2: Illegitimate Pressure**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: LN Ltd faced illegitimate pressure from the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union, who demanded payments to allow goods to pass, and from DSTR Ltd, who demanded increased haulage rates under the threat of ceasing delivery. Similarly, in LKF v. ZTISL, the court examined whether the pressure exerted was illegitimate, considering factors such as the nature of the threat and whether the party had any realistic practical alternative.

- **Legal Concept 3: Affirmation of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: LN Ltd continued to pay the increased haulage rates to DSTR Ltd and made payments to the Union, which could be seen as an affirmation of the coerced agreements. In LKF v. ZTISL, the court noted that the applicant had affirmed the contract by continuing to earn commissions under the new agreement.

- **Legal Concept 4: Burden of Proof**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: LN Ltd must provide evidence to support their claims of economic duress and illegitimate pressure. In LKF v. ZTISL, the court highlighted that the burden of proof lies on the applicant to provide sufficiently precise factual evidence to support their claims.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in LKF v. ZTISL. This decision would be justified because, as in LKF v. ZTISL, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Contractual Integrity**: By allowing LN Ltd to recover the monies paid under duress, the court would reinforce the principle that contracts should be entered into freely and without coercion. This upholds the integrity of contractual agreements and ensures that parties cannot be forced into unfair terms through illegitimate pressure.

2. **Deterring Coercive Practices**: A ruling in favor of LN Ltd would serve as a deterrent to other parties who might consider using economic duress or illegitimate pressure to extract unfair concessions. This promotes fair dealing and ethical business practices.

3. **Protecting Vulnerable Parties**: The decision would protect parties who find themselves in a weaker bargaining position and are subjected to coercive tactics. This aligns with the equitable principles of fairness and justice that underpin contract law.

4. **Consistency in Legal Application**: Applying the same legal principles consistently across similar cases ensures predictability and stability in the law. This helps businesses and individuals understand their rights and obligations, fostering a more reliable legal environment.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in LKF v. ZTISL, it would have the positive effects of upholding contractual integrity, deterring coercive practices, protecting vulnerable parties, and ensuring consistency in the application of the law.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case

In the precedent case LKF v. ZTISL, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the applicant's failure to provide sufficiently precise factual evidence to support their claims of economic duress and unconscionable bargain. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—upholding the integrity of contractual agreements and deterring frivolous claims—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it emphasized the necessity of substantial evidence to support serious allegations. However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as LN Ltd has provided detailed evidence of the payments made to the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union and DSTR Ltd, as well as the circumstances under which these payments were made. This includes documentation of the threats and the lack of alternatives available to LN Ltd, which supports their claims of economic duress and illegitimate pressure.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case

Our current case involves an important factor—the presence of a highly inflammable substance (nitrocellulose) and the significant increase in insurance costs—that was not present in LKF v. ZTISL. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of economic duress and illegitimate pressure because the hazardous nature of the goods and the increased insurance costs add an additional layer of urgency and necessity to LN Ltd's decision to comply with DSTR Ltd's demands. Due to this factor, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as compromising the safety and timely delivery of hazardous materials, than positive ones, unlike in LKF v. ZTISL. This is because the presence of hazardous materials and increased insurance costs create a scenario where LN Ltd had even fewer practical alternatives and faced greater risks, thereby justifying their compliance under duress.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from LKF v. ZTISL should be stated as: "When both the fact pattern of economic duress and illegitimate pressure (i*) and the presence of a highly inflammable substance with increased insurance costs (m) are present, the court should decide that the coerced payments or agreements are voidable and the monies paid can be recovered (o)." Omitting the presence of a highly inflammable substance with increased insurance costs (m) from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence (q) of compromising the safety and timely delivery of hazardous materials. Indeed, the opinion in LKF v. ZTISL explicitly states that the burden of proof lies on the applicant to provide sufficiently precise factual evidence to support their claims, which highlights the importance of considering all relevant factors, including the urgency and necessity created by the presence of hazardous materials.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in LKF v. ZTISL was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence (u) of allowing frivolous claims of economic duress and unconscionable bargain to succeed without substantial evidence. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because LN Ltd has provided detailed evidence of the payments made under duress and the circumstances surrounding these payments, including the presence of hazardous materials and increased insurance costs. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule strictly without considering the additional factor of hazardous materials would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—to prevent frivolous claims—does not apply to our situation where substantial evidence has been provided.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the presence of a highly inflammable substance with increased insurance costs (factor m), which was present in the precedent case LKF v. ZTISL, requiring this factor for all similar cases of economic duress and illegitimate pressure (fact pattern i*) would lead to the undesirable consequence of limiting the protection against economic duress to only those cases involving hazardous materials. Conversely, not requiring the presence of hazardous materials would allow for a broader application of the principles of economic duress and illegitimate pressure, ensuring that all parties subjected to coercive tactics can seek relief. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which aim to ensure fairness and prevent exploitation in contractual relationships.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the presence of a highly inflammable substance with increased insurance costs (factor m), which was present in LKF v. ZTISL, we have the additional factor of detailed evidence of the payments made under duress and the circumstances surrounding these payments (factor n). This factor n, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of economic duress and illegitimate pressure (fact pattern i*), serves a similar function to factor m in the precedent case. Given the presence of detailed evidence, we submit that the reasoning in LKF v. ZTISL still applies, as the positive effects on upholding contractual integrity, deterring coercive practices, and protecting vulnerable parties would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to LKF v. ZTISL, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in the fact patterns of economic duress and illegitimate pressure. However, it also differs in significant ways, such as the presence of highly inflammable substances and increased insurance costs in the current case, which were not present in LKF v. ZTISL.

The proposed legal rule that coerced payments or agreements are voidable and the monies paid can be recovered finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the necessity of providing substantial evidence to support claims of economic duress (as emphasized in LKF v. ZTISL) and the additional urgency and necessity created by the presence of hazardous materials in the current case.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, protection against coercive practices, and the need for substantial evidence to support serious allegations, we conclude that LN Ltd should be able to recover the monies paid to the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union and DSTR Ltd if they can establish that the payments were made under economic duress and illegitimate pressure. Additionally, LN Ltd should not be bound to pay Gloop plc for the testing costs if they can demonstrate that the demand was made under similar coercive circumstances.

This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by ensuring that parties subjected to coercive tactics can seek relief, particularly when substantial evidence supports their claims. The key factors influencing this outcome include the detailed evidence provided by LN Ltd, the presence of hazardous materials, and the increased insurance costs, which collectively justify the application of the principles established in LKF v. ZTISL to the current case.

### Minor Premise:

1. Occupiers Liability Ordinance Cap. 314 Section 6 Subsection 1-4:
   - LN Ltd contracted with Baltimore & McNulty Ltd to use their computerised transit system.
   - The Administrative Dock Workers’ Union interfered with the goods, causing LN Ltd to pay £30,000.
   - The duty owed to LN Ltd by Baltimore & McNulty Ltd would depend on a term to be implied in the contract by reason of its conferring the right to use the transit system.
   - However, the obligations are imposed on a person by or by virtue of a contract for the carriage for reward of goods in a vehicle, vessel, aircraft, or other means of transport.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 57 Subsection 1-2:
   - LN Ltd has a contract with DSTR Ltd for the delivery of nitrocellulose.
   - DSTR Ltd demanded an increase in haulage rates due to rising insurance costs.
   - LN Ltd reluctantly agreed and paid £50,000.
   - The right, duty, or liability arising under the contract of sale of goods may be negatived or varied by express agreement or by the course of dealing between the parties.
   - There is no indication that the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 71) applies or that an express condition or warranty is inconsistent with the implied terms.
   - Therefore, this section applies, and the variation in haulage rates is valid.

3. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 4 Subsection 1-4:
   - Gloop plc provides pigment for LN Ltd's nail polish.
   - Gloop plc demands £5,000 per annum for testing costs, threatening to cease offering credit otherwise.
   - The contract between LN Ltd and Gloop plc does not expressly provide that a third party may enforce a term, nor does it purport to confer a benefit on a third party.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

### Conclusion:

1. The Occupiers Liability Ordinance Cap. 314 Section 6 Subsection 1-4 does not apply to the contract between LN Ltd and Baltimore & McNulty Ltd. Therefore, LN Ltd cannot recover the £30,000 paid to the Union under this Ordinance.

2. The Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 57 Subsection 1-2 applies to the contract between LN Ltd and DSTR Ltd. The variation in haulage rates is valid, and LN Ltd cannot recover the £50,000 paid to DSTR Ltd.

3. The Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 4 Subsection 1-4 does not apply to the contract between LN Ltd and Gloop plc. Therefore, LN Ltd is not bound to pay the £5,000 per annum for testing costs under this Ordinance.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum)

In the case of Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum (precedent p), the plaintiff, Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited, sought to recover a sum of HK$2,869,533.60 from the defendant, Wong Cheung Sum, based on cheques that were dishonoured. The defendant claimed that the cheques were given under duress. The court ruled that the defendant's story of duress was not credible and that the cheques were not given under duress. Consequently, the court allowed the plaintiff's appeal, set aside the order giving the defendant unconditional leave to defend, and restored the order of the master in favour of the plaintiff.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Duress and Coercion**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In Chu Kong, the defendant claimed that the cheques were given under duress due to threats of violence. In the current case, LN Ltd may argue that the payments to the Union and DSTR Ltd were made under economic duress due to the threats of stopping goods and ceasing delivery, respectively.

- **Legal Concept 2: Voluntariness of Consent**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In Chu Kong, the court examined whether the defendant's consent to issue the cheques was voluntary or coerced. In the current case, the court will need to determine whether LN Ltd's consent to pay the Union and DSTR Ltd was voluntary or coerced by the circumstances.

- **Legal Concept 3: Immediate Necessity and Preservation of Rights**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In Chu Kong, the court considered whether the payments were made under immediate necessity and with the intention of preserving the right to dispute the legality of the demand. In the current case, LN Ltd made payments to the Union and DSTR Ltd under the immediate necessity to continue their business operations and may argue that they intended to preserve their right to dispute the legality of the demands.

- **Legal Concept 4: Credibility of Duress Claims**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In Chu Kong, the court assessed the credibility of the defendant's duress claims based on the surrounding facts and evidence. In the current case, the court will similarly need to assess the credibility of LN Ltd's claims of economic duress based on the surrounding facts and evidence.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of alleged duress (i*) involving threats that induce a party to make payments or enter into agreements unwillingly, the court should decide whether the duress claims are credible and whether the payments were made under immediate necessity with the intention of preserving the right to dispute the legality of the demands (outcome o). This rule was justified in Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum because the court found that the defendant's claims of duress were not credible based on the surrounding facts and evidence, and the payments were not made under immediate necessity with the intention of preserving the right to dispute the legality of the demands. The positive effects (E+) of this outcome on the underlying values and principles of the law, such as ensuring the voluntariness of consent and preventing abuse of coercive tactics, outweigh the negative effects (E-) in that case.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Duress and Coercion**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In Chu Kong, the defendant claimed that the cheques were given under duress due to threats of violence. In the current case, LN Ltd may argue that the payments to the Union and DSTR Ltd were made under economic duress due to the threats of stopping goods and ceasing delivery, respectively.

- **Legal Concept 2: Voluntariness of Consent**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In Chu Kong, the court examined whether the defendant's consent to issue the cheques was voluntary or coerced. In the current case, the court will need to determine whether LN Ltd's consent to pay the Union and DSTR Ltd was voluntary or coerced by the circumstances.

- **Legal Concept 3: Immediate Necessity and Preservation of Rights**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In Chu Kong, the court considered whether the payments were made under immediate necessity and with the intention of preserving the right to dispute the legality of the demand. In the current case, LN Ltd made payments to the Union and DSTR Ltd under the immediate necessity to continue their business operations and may argue that they intended to preserve their right to dispute the legality of the demands.

- **Legal Concept 4: Credibility of Duress Claims**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In Chu Kong, the court assessed the credibility of the defendant's duress claims based on the surrounding facts and evidence. In the current case, the court will similarly need to assess the credibility of LN Ltd's claims of economic duress based on the surrounding facts and evidence.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Voluntariness of Consent**: By scrutinizing the claims of duress and ensuring that consent was given voluntarily, the court upholds the principle that contracts and payments should be made without coercion. This protects the integrity of contractual agreements and ensures that parties are not forced into unfair terms.

2. **Preventing Abuse of Coercive Tactics**: By allowing LN Ltd to recover the monies paid under duress, the court would deter other parties from using coercive tactics to extract payments or favorable terms. This promotes fair dealing and discourages the use of threats or undue pressure in commercial transactions.

3. **Encouraging Legal Remedies**: By recognizing the right to dispute payments made under duress, the court encourages parties to seek legal remedies rather than succumbing to unlawful demands. This reinforces the rule of law and ensures that disputes are resolved through proper legal channels.

4. **Economic Stability**: By allowing recovery of payments made under duress, the court helps maintain economic stability for businesses like LN Ltd, which might otherwise suffer significant financial harm due to coercive practices. This supports a fair and competitive business environment.

Therefore, given the shared fact patterns and the positive effects on the underlying values and principles of the law, the court should allow LN Ltd to recover the monies paid to the Union and DSTR Ltd and should not bind LN Ltd to pay for the testing costs demanded by Gloop plc. This decision aligns with the precedent set in Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum and upholds the principles of fairness, voluntariness, and legal integrity in contractual dealings.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case

In the precedent case **Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the **lack of immediate protest or legal action by the defendant** after the alleged duress. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling (upholding the integrity of contractual agreements and deterring false claims of duress) outweighed any potential drawbacks (such as the possibility of overlooking genuine cases of duress) because it demonstrated that the defendant's claims were not credible and that the payments were not made under immediate necessity with the intention of preserving the right to dispute the legality of the demands. 

However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as **LN Ltd did not have the opportunity to immediately protest or take legal action against the Union and DSTR Ltd due to the ongoing nature of the threats and the immediate necessity to continue their business operations**. LN Ltd was under continuous pressure to make payments to avoid significant disruptions to their business, which distinguishes their situation from the defendant in the precedent case who had the opportunity to protest and take legal action but did not do so.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case

Our current case involves an important factor **(the ongoing and continuous nature of the threats and the immediate necessity to continue business operations)** that was not present in **Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it demonstrates that LN Ltd was under continuous economic duress and had no practical alternative but to comply with the demands to avoid severe business disruptions. 

Due to this ongoing and continuous nature of the threats, applying the same outcome (denying the recovery of payments made under duress) in our case would have more negative consequences such as **encouraging coercive practices and undermining the ability of businesses to operate without undue pressure** than positive ones, unlike in **Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum**. In the precedent case, the lack of immediate protest or legal action by the defendant indicated that the claims of duress were not credible, whereas in our current case, the continuous nature of the threats and the immediate necessity to continue business operations provide a credible basis for LN Ltd's claims of economic duress.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from **Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum** should be stated as: "When both [i*] (alleged duress involving threats that induce a party to make payments or enter into agreements unwillingly) and [m] (the ongoing and continuous nature of the threats and the immediate necessity to continue business operations) are present, the court should decide [o] (allowing the recovery of payments made under duress)." Omitting [m] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q] (encouraging coercive practices and undermining the ability of businesses to operate without undue pressure). Indeed, the opinion in **Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum** explicitly states that the lack of immediate protest or legal action by the defendant was crucial to their decision, highlighting the importance of the opportunity to protest or take legal action in assessing the credibility of duress claims.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in **Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum** was clearly designed to prevent [undesirable consequence u] (the abuse of duress claims to avoid legitimate contractual obligations). However, in our current case, there's no risk of [u] occurring because LN Ltd was under continuous economic duress and had no practical alternative but to comply with the demands to avoid severe business disruptions. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The continuous nature of the threats and the immediate necessity to continue business operations provide a credible basis for LN Ltd's claims of economic duress, distinguishing it from the precedent case where the defendant had the opportunity to protest and take legal action but did not do so.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the immediate protest or legal action by LN Ltd, which was present in the precedent case **Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of alleged duress involving threats that induce a party to make payments or enter into agreements unwillingly would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would encourage coercive practices and undermine the ability of businesses to operate without undue pressure. Conversely, not requiring the immediate protest or legal action would allow for a more realistic and fair assessment of economic duress, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area. These principles include ensuring the voluntariness of consent, preventing abuse of coercive tactics, and maintaining economic stability for businesses.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the immediate protest or legal action by LN Ltd, which was present in **Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum**, we have the additional factor of the ongoing and continuous nature of the threats and the immediate necessity to continue business operations. This ongoing and continuous nature of the threats, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of alleged duress, serves a similar function to the immediate protest or legal action in the precedent case. Given the presence of this ongoing and continuous nature of the threats, we submit that the reasoning in **Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum** still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values—such as ensuring the voluntariness of consent, preventing abuse of coercive tactics, and maintaining economic stability for businesses—would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of alleged duress involving threats that induce a party to make payments or enter into agreements unwillingly, and the need to assess the voluntariness of consent and the credibility of duress claims. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the ongoing and continuous nature of the threats and the immediate necessity to continue business operations in the current case, which were not present in the precedent.

The proposed legal rule from **Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum**—that the court should decide whether the duress claims are credible and whether the payments were made under immediate necessity with the intention of preserving the right to dispute the legality of the demands—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the continuous nature of the threats in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point from the initial analogy that the court should scrutinize the claims of duress to ensure the voluntariness of consent and prevent abuse of coercive tactics, and the strong counterargument that the ongoing and continuous nature of the threats in the current case provides a credible basis for LN Ltd's claims of economic duress.

Considering the underlying legal principles of ensuring the voluntariness of consent, preventing abuse of coercive tactics, and maintaining economic stability for businesses, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that LN Ltd should be allowed to recover the monies paid to the Union and DSTR Ltd. This decision aligns with the principles of fairness, voluntariness, and legal integrity in contractual dealings, while also recognizing the unique circumstances of continuous economic duress faced by LN Ltd.

Therefore, LN Ltd is not bound to pay for the testing costs demanded by Gloop plc, as the demands were made under duress and the payments were not made voluntarily. This conclusion ensures that businesses are protected from coercive practices and can operate without undue pressure, upholding the integrity of contractual agreements and promoting fair dealing in commercial transactions.

   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

2. Trade Unions Ordinance Cap. 332 Section 42:
   - The Administrative Dock Workers’ Union is a registered trade union.
   - The union's actions are in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute.

### Conclusion:

LN Ltd cannot claim damages from the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union or its members for the additional costs incurred due to the interference, as per the Trade Unions Ordinance Cap. 332 Sections 42, 43, and 43A.

Regarding DSTR Ltd, LN Ltd may have a claim for economic duress if they can prove that the demand for increased haulage rates was made under coercion, leaving them with no practical alternative but to agree. However, this would require further analysis of the specifics of the contract and the circumstances under which the agreement was made.

As for Gloop plc, unless there is a contractual obligation for LN Ltd to cover the costs of testing, LN Ltd is not bound to pay the £5,000 per annum. The threat to cease offering credit may be a commercial pressure but does not constitute a legal obligation unless agreed upon in the contract.

- It is reasonable to suppose that both parties would have contemplated the potential for such interference and the resulting costs at the time the contract was made, given the nature of the transit system and the potential for labour disputes.

### Conclusion:

Richly Bright International Limited v De Monsa Investments Limited applies, and LN Ltd is entitled to recover the £30,000 paid to the Union as damages for the breach of contract by Baltimore & McNulty Ltd.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA 1927/2016)
In the case of HCA 1927/2016 between Shenzhen CTS International Logistics Co Ltd and CTS International Logistics Corporation Limited (Plaintiffs) and Dajiang International Investment Co Limited (Defendant), the court ruled that the Defendant's application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. The court found that the Defendant had submitted to the jurisdiction of the Hong Kong Court and had no arguable defence on the merits. Additionally, the court determined that Hong Kong was the appropriate forum for the trial of the action.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA 1927/2016 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Submission to Jurisdiction**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (HCA 1927/2016)**: The Defendant applied for various forms of relief, including security for costs and striking out the Statement of Claim, which indicated submission to the jurisdiction of the Hong Kong Court.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (Current Case)**: LN Ltd may argue that DSTR Ltd and Gloop plc have submitted to the jurisdiction by engaging in contractual negotiations and demanding additional payments.

- **Legal Concept 2: Breach of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (HCA 1927/2016)**: The Defendant was found to be in breach of clause 5.1 of the Conditions by failing to provide accurate shipping information, leading to damages.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (Current Case)**: DSTR Ltd breached the contract by demanding an increase in haulage rates without a price variation clause, and the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union interfered with the delivery system, causing additional costs.

- **Legal Concept 3: Damages and Indemnity**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (HCA 1927/2016)**: The Plaintiffs sought damages and indemnity for the losses incurred due to the Defendant's breach.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (Current Case)**: LN Ltd seeks to recover the additional costs incurred due to the wrongful interference by the Union and the increased haulage rates demanded by DSTR Ltd.

- **Legal Concept 4: Appropriate Forum**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (HCA 1927/2016)**: The court determined that Hong Kong was the appropriate forum for the trial, considering the location of evidence and witnesses.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (Current Case)**: The appropriate forum for resolving the disputes with DSTR Ltd and Gloop plc may be determined based on the location of contractual performance and the parties involved.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA 1927/2016)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a party submitting to the jurisdiction, breaching a contract, and causing damages, the court should decide in favour of the aggrieved party seeking damages and indemnity. This rule was justified in HCA 1927/2016 because the positive effects of holding the breaching party accountable and providing relief to the aggrieved party outweighed any negative effects. The court's decision upheld the principles of contractual obligations and jurisdictional submission, ensuring that parties cannot evade liability by challenging jurisdiction after engaging in substantive legal actions.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA 1927/2016) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Submission to Jurisdiction**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (HCA 1927/2016)**: The Defendant applied for various forms of relief, including security for costs and striking out the Statement of Claim, which indicated submission to the jurisdiction of the Hong Kong Court.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (Current Case)**: DSTR Ltd and Gloop plc have engaged in contractual negotiations and demanded additional payments, indicating their submission to the jurisdiction where the contract is being performed.

- **Legal Concept 2: Breach of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (HCA 1927/2016)**: The Defendant was found to be in breach of clause 5.1 of the Conditions by failing to provide accurate shipping information, leading to damages.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (Current Case)**: DSTR Ltd breached the contract by demanding an increase in haulage rates without a price variation clause, and the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union interfered with the delivery system, causing additional costs.

- **Legal Concept 3: Damages and Indemnity**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (HCA 1927/2016)**: The Plaintiffs sought damages and indemnity for the losses incurred due to the Defendant's breach.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (Current Case)**: LN Ltd seeks to recover the additional costs incurred due to the wrongful interference by the Union and the increased haulage rates demanded by DSTR Ltd.

- **Legal Concept 4: Appropriate Forum**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (HCA 1927/2016)**: The court determined that Hong Kong was the appropriate forum for the trial, considering the location of evidence and witnesses.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (Current Case)**: The appropriate forum for resolving the disputes with DSTR Ltd and Gloop plc may be determined based on the location of contractual performance and the parties involved.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCA 1927/2016. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA 1927/2016, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Contractual Obligations**: Just as in HCA 1927/2016, holding DSTR Ltd and Gloop plc accountable for their contractual obligations ensures that parties cannot unilaterally alter the terms of a contract to the detriment of the other party. This promotes fairness and reliability in commercial transactions.

2. **Deterring Unlawful Interference**: By allowing LN Ltd to recover the additional costs incurred due to the wrongful interference by the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union, the court would deter similar unlawful actions in the future, thereby protecting businesses from undue disruptions.

3. **Ensuring Jurisdictional Consistency**: Just as the court in HCA 1927/2016 found that the Defendant had submitted to the jurisdiction, recognizing the jurisdictional submission of DSTR Ltd and Gloop plc would ensure consistency in the application of jurisdictional principles, thereby providing legal certainty.

4. **Facilitating Efficient Resolution**: By addressing the disputes in the appropriate forum where the contractual performance and evidence are located, the court would facilitate a more efficient and effective resolution of the issues, minimizing unnecessary delays and costs.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA 1927/2016, it would have the positive effects of upholding contractual obligations, deterring unlawful interference, ensuring jurisdictional consistency, and facilitating efficient resolution.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA 1927/2016, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the Defendant had submitted to the jurisdiction of the Hong Kong Court. This submission to jurisdiction was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as upholding contractual obligations and ensuring jurisdictional consistency, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided a clear basis for the court to exercise its authority and resolve the dispute efficiently. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of clear submission to jurisdiction is notably absent. DSTR Ltd and Gloop plc have not engaged in any legal actions or sought relief from the court that would unequivocally indicate their submission to the jurisdiction. This absence of clear submission to jurisdiction weakens the argument that the court has the same authority to resolve the disputes in the current case as it did in HCA 1927/2016.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor of wrongful interference by a third party (the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union) that was not present in HCA 1927/2016. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces an element of external unlawful action that directly caused additional costs to LN Ltd. Due to this wrongful interference, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as failing to address the unlawful actions of the Union and not providing adequate relief to LN Ltd for the additional costs incurred. Unlike in HCA 1927/2016, where the dispute was primarily between the contracting parties, the current case involves an external party whose actions have directly impacted the contractual performance and financial obligations of LN Ltd. This distinction necessitates a different legal approach to ensure that LN Ltd is adequately compensated for the wrongful interference and additional costs incurred.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA 1927/2016 should be stated as "When both [submission to jurisdiction] and [breach of contract] are present, the court should decide [in favor of the aggrieved party seeking damages and indemnity]." Omitting [submission to jurisdiction] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q], which is the potential for parties to evade liability by challenging jurisdiction after engaging in substantive legal actions. Indeed, the opinion in HCA 1927/2016 explicitly states that the Defendant's submission to the jurisdiction was crucial to their decision, as it provided a clear basis for the court to exercise its authority and resolve the dispute efficiently.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA 1927/2016 was clearly designed to prevent [undesirable consequence u], which is the evasion of liability by parties who engage in substantive legal actions but later challenge the court's jurisdiction. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [u] occurring because DSTR Ltd and Gloop plc have not engaged in any legal actions or sought relief from the court that would unequivocally indicate their submission to the jurisdiction. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The absence of clear submission to jurisdiction in the current case necessitates a different legal approach to ensure that LN Ltd is adequately compensated for the wrongful interference and additional costs incurred.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the clear submission to jurisdiction (factor m), which was present in the precedent case HCA 1927/2016, requiring this factor for all similar cases of breach of contract and damages would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would allow parties to evade liability by simply not engaging in any legal actions that would indicate submission to jurisdiction, thereby undermining the enforcement of contractual obligations and the protection of aggrieved parties. Conversely, not requiring clear submission to jurisdiction would allow for a more equitable resolution of disputes based on the substantive merits of the case, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law and the need to uphold contractual obligations and provide relief for wrongful actions.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the clear submission to jurisdiction (factor m), which was present in HCA 1927/2016, we have the additional factor of wrongful interference by a third party (factor n). This wrongful interference by the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of breach of contract and damages (fact pattern i*), serves a similar function to the submission to jurisdiction in the precedent case. Given the presence of this wrongful interference, we submit that the reasoning in HCA 1927/2016 still applies, as the positive effects on upholding contractual obligations, deterring unlawful actions, and providing relief to aggrieved parties would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA 1927/2016, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the breach of contract and the resulting damages. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of clear submission to jurisdiction by DSTR Ltd and Gloop plc, and the presence of wrongful interference by a third party (the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union).

The proposed legal rule of "When both [submission to jurisdiction] and [breach of contract] are present, the court should decide [in favor of the aggrieved party seeking damages and indemnity]" finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of submission to jurisdiction in ensuring the court's authority (as highlighted in HCA 1927/2016) and the need to address wrongful interference and uphold contractual obligations (as argued in the current case).

Considering the underlying legal principles of contract law, including the enforcement of contractual obligations and the provision of relief for wrongful actions, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that LN Ltd should be entitled to recover the additional costs incurred due to the wrongful interference by the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union and the increased haulage rates demanded by DSTR Ltd. However, LN Ltd is not bound to pay Gloop plc for the testing costs unless such a requirement is explicitly stated in their contract.

This decision is reached because the wrongful interference by the Union and the breach of contract by DSTR Ltd have directly caused financial harm to LN Ltd, and it is essential to uphold the principles of contractual obligations and provide relief for such wrongful actions. The absence of clear submission to jurisdiction by DSTR Ltd and Gloop plc does not negate the need to address the substantive merits of the case and ensure justice for the aggrieved party.

Key factors influencing this outcome include the direct financial harm caused to LN Ltd, the need to deter unlawful interference, and the importance of upholding contractual obligations. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency.


# Contract Law: Whether the increase in insurance costs constitutes a frustration of the contract between LN Ltd and DSTR Ltd

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2, 3, and 6

### Major Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - A contract governed by law applicable to the Colony has become impossible of performance or been otherwise frustrated.
   - The parties thereto have for that reason been discharged from the further performance of the contract.

   Consequences:
   - All sums paid or payable to any party in pursuance of the contract before the time when the parties were so discharged shall, in the case of sums so paid, be recoverable from him as money received by him for the use of the party by whom the sums were paid.
   - In the case of sums so payable, cease to be so payable.

   Exceptions:
   - The party to whom the sums were so paid or payable incurred expenses before the time of discharge in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, the court may, if it considers it just to do so having regard to all the circumstances of the case, allow him to retain or, as the case may be, recover the whole or any part of the sums so paid or payable, not being an amount in excess of the expenses so incurred.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3

   Conditions:
   - Any party to the contract has, by reason of anything done by any other party thereto in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, obtained a valuable benefit (other than a payment of money to which subsection (2) applies) before the time of discharge.

   Consequences:
   - There shall be recoverable from him by the said other party such sum (if any), not exceeding the value of the said benefit to the party obtaining it, as the court considers just, having regard to all the circumstances of the case.

   Exceptions:
   - The amount of any expenses incurred before the time of discharge by the benefited party in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, including any sums paid or payable by him to any other party in pursuance of the contract and retained or recoverable by that party under subsection (2).
   - The effect, in relation to the said benefit, of the circumstances giving rise to the frustration of the contract.

3. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 6

   Conditions:
   - Any person has assumed obligations under the contract in consideration of the conferring of a benefit by any other party to the contract upon any other person, whether a party to the contract or not.

   Consequences:
   - The court may, if in all the circumstances of the case it considers it just to do so, treat for the purposes of subsection (3) any benefit so conferred as a benefit obtained by the person who has assumed the obligations as aforesaid.

   Exceptions:
   - None.

### Minor Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2:
- LN Ltd and DSTR Ltd have a contract for the delivery of nitrocellulose.
- The contract has not become impossible of performance or been otherwise frustrated due to the increase in insurance costs.
- Therefore, this section does not apply.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3:
- LN Ltd has paid £50,000 to DSTR Ltd under duress to continue the delivery of nitrocellulose.
- This payment was made under the threat of ceasing delivery, not due to the performance of the contract.
- Therefore, this section does not apply.

3. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 6:
- LN Ltd has assumed the obligation to pay £50,000 to DSTR Ltd under duress.
- The court may consider it just to treat the benefit conferred (continued delivery) as a benefit obtained by DSTR Ltd.
- However, this does not directly address the issue of recovering the £50,000 paid under duress.

### Conclusion:

The increase in insurance costs does not constitute a frustration of the contract between LN Ltd and DSTR Ltd. Therefore, the Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 does not provide a basis for LN Ltd to recover the monies paid to DSTR Ltd. LN Ltd is not bound to pay Gloop plc for the testing costs unless it agrees to do so under a new contractual arrangement.

### Relevant law:

HCA 972/2011 Cheung Kit Lai v Rich Prosper Limited and Wharf Realty Ltd v. Abebi Limited T/A 'Armani Junior' [2022] HKCFI 2036

### Major Premise:

1. HCA 972/2011 Cheung Kit Lai v Rich Prosper Limited

   Conditions:
   - The performance of the contract is rendered impossible or only possible in a very different way from that contemplated.
   - Without default of either party.
   - Due to an outside event or extraneous change of situation.
   - Which was not within the expectation, assumption, and contemplation of the parties at the time they entered into the contract.
   - The delay is abnormal in its cause, its effects, or its expected duration, falling outside what the parties could reasonably contemplate at the time of contracting.

   Consequences:
   - The contract may be discharged under the doctrine of frustration.

   Exceptions:
   - The performance is merely difficult or onerous.
   - The delay is within the reasonable contemplation of the parties.
   - The performance is not radically different from what the parties have contracted for.

2. Wharf Realty Ltd v. Abebi Limited T/A 'Armani Junior' [2022] HKCFI 2036

   Conditions:
   - There supervenes an event (without default of either party and for which the contract makes no sufficient provision) which so significantly changes the nature (not merely the expense or onerousness) of the outstanding contractual rights and/or obligations from what the parties could reasonably have contemplated at the time of its execution.

   Consequences:
   - The law declares both parties to be discharged from further performance.

   Exceptions:
   - The contract is wide enough to apply to the new situation.
   - The change is merely in the expense or onerousness of the obligations.

### Minor Premise:

1. HCA 972/2011 Cheung Kit Lai v Rich Prosper Limited:
- The performance of the contract between LN Ltd and DSTR Ltd is not rendered impossible or only possible in a very different way from that contemplated. The increase in insurance costs and the demand for higher haulage rates do not make the performance impossible, just more expensive.
- The increase in insurance costs and the demand for higher haulage rates are outside events or extraneous changes of situation.
- These changes were not within the expectation, assumption, and contemplation of the parties at the time they entered into the contract.
- The delay or increased cost is not abnormal in its cause, effects, or expected duration, falling outside what the parties could reasonably contemplate at the time of contracting.
- Therefore, the contract is not discharged under the doctrine of frustration as the performance is merely difficult or onerous.

2. Wharf Realty Ltd v. Abebi Limited T/A 'Armani Junior' [2022] HKCFI 2036:
- There supervenes an event (increase in insurance costs and demand for higher haulage rates) without default of either party and for which the contract makes no sufficient provision.
- This event does not significantly change the nature of the outstanding contractual rights and/or obligations from what the parties could reasonably have contemplated at the time of its execution. The change is merely in the expense or onerousness of the obligations.
- Therefore, the law does not declare both parties to be discharged from further performance.

### Conclusion:

The increase in insurance costs does not constitute a frustration of the contract between LN Ltd and DSTR Ltd. The performance of the contract has become more expensive but not impossible or radically different. Therefore, LN Ltd cannot recover the monies paid to DSTR Ltd under the doctrine of frustration. Additionally, LN Ltd is not bound to pay Gloop plc for the testing costs as this is a new demand not covered by the original contract terms.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR")

In the case of WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" [2022] HKCFI 2036; HCA 954/2020 (precedent p), the defendants (tenants) argued that the plaintiff's (landlord's) actions constituted a breach of the quiet enjoyment covenant and derogation from grant due to the social unrest and the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to substantial interference with their business. The court ruled that the defendants' counterclaim should not be struck out and that they should be granted unconditional leave to defend. The court also discussed the doctrine of frustration, stating that the contract was not frustrated as the events did not render the obligations radically different from what was contemplated under the contract.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Breach of Contractual Obligations**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In WHARF REALTY, the tenants claimed that the landlord's actions breached the quiet enjoyment covenant. In our current case, LN Ltd faces potential breaches of contract by DSTR Ltd and Gloop plc due to increased costs and demands.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Doctrine of Frustration**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In WHARF REALTY, the court examined whether the social unrest and pandemic frustrated the tenancy agreements. In our current case, LN Ltd may argue that the increased insurance costs and demands by DSTR Ltd constitute frustration of the contract.
  
- **Legal Concept 3: Economic Hardship and Risk Allocation**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In WHARF REALTY, the court noted that economic downturns and market conditions are generally risks borne by the tenant. In our current case, LN Ltd faces increased costs due to external factors, raising questions about risk allocation in their contracts with DSTR Ltd and Gloop plc.
  
- **Legal Concept 4: Unlawful Interference**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In WHARF REALTY, the tenants claimed unlawful interference by the landlord. In our current case, LN Ltd faces unlawful interference by the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union, leading to additional costs.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR")

This suggests a general rule that when we see **fact pattern i*** (economic hardship and external interference leading to increased costs), the court should decide **outcome o** (the contract is not frustrated, and the parties must bear the risks as per their contractual obligations). This rule was justified in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" because the court emphasized that economic downturns and market conditions are generally risks borne by the tenant, and the doctrine of frustration is kept within very narrow limits. The positive effects (E+) of this outcome include upholding the sanctity of contracts and ensuring that parties cannot easily escape their contractual obligations due to economic hardship. The negative effects (E-) are mitigated by the fact that parties can negotiate specific clauses to address such risks in their contracts.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR") are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Breach of Contractual Obligations**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In WHARF REALTY, the tenants claimed that the landlord's actions breached the quiet enjoyment covenant. In our current case, LN Ltd faces potential breaches of contract by DSTR Ltd and Gloop plc due to increased costs and demands.

- **Legal Concept 2: Doctrine of Frustration**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In WHARF REALTY, the court examined whether the social unrest and pandemic frustrated the tenancy agreements. In our current case, LN Ltd may argue that the increased insurance costs and demands by DSTR Ltd constitute frustration of the contract.

- **Legal Concept 3: Economic Hardship and Risk Allocation**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In WHARF REALTY, the court noted that economic downturns and market conditions are generally risks borne by the tenant. In our current case, LN Ltd faces increased costs due to external factors, raising questions about risk allocation in their contracts with DSTR Ltd and Gloop plc.

- **Legal Concept 4: Unlawful Interference**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In WHARF REALTY, the tenants claimed unlawful interference by the landlord. In our current case, LN Ltd faces unlawful interference by the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union, leading to additional costs.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR". This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding the Sanctity of Contracts**: Enforcing the contracts as they stand, despite the increased costs and external interferences, ensures that parties cannot easily escape their contractual obligations due to economic hardship. This promotes stability and predictability in commercial transactions.

2. **Encouraging Risk Management**: By holding parties to their contracts, the court encourages businesses to negotiate specific clauses to address potential risks, such as price variation clauses or force majeure provisions, at the time of contract formation.

3. **Preventing Unjust Enrichment**: Allowing LN Ltd to recover the additional costs paid to DSTR Ltd and the Union would prevent DSTR Ltd and the Union from benefiting unjustly from the situation. Similarly, not binding LN Ltd to pay for Gloop plc's testing costs ensures that Gloop plc cannot unilaterally impose additional financial burdens on LN Ltd.

4. **Maintaining Commercial Expectations**: The decision reinforces the principle that commercial expectations, such as the influx of tourists or stable insurance costs, are merely expectations and not guaranteed conditions of the contract. This aligns with the understanding that businesses must bear the risks associated with market fluctuations and external events.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR", it would uphold the sanctity of contracts, encourage risk management, prevent unjust enrichment, and maintain commercial expectations.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case

In the precedent case **WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR"**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the tenants were able to argue a breach of the quiet enjoyment covenant and derogation from grant due to the landlord's actions during the social unrest and pandemic. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling (upholding the tenants' right to defend their counterclaim and potentially claim damages) outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided a clear legal basis for the tenants' claims and allowed for a fair trial to resolve factual disputes. However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as LN Ltd does not have a similar covenant or specific contractual provision that directly addresses the issues of increased costs due to external factors like the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union's interference or the insurance cost hike.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case

Our current case involves an important factor, **the unlawful interference by the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union**, that was not present in **WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR"**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces an element of external, unlawful interference that directly impacts LN Ltd's ability to fulfill its contractual obligations. Due to this unlawful interference, applying the same outcome (i.e., not allowing recovery of additional costs) in our case would have more negative consequences such as encouraging unlawful actions by third parties and placing an undue burden on LN Ltd to bear costs arising from such interference. Unlike in **WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR"**, where the disruptions were due to broader social and economic conditions, the specific unlawful actions by the Union in our case create a distinct legal issue that warrants a different consideration.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from **WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR"** should be stated as "When both [economic hardship and external interference leading to increased costs] and [unlawful interference by a third party] are present, the court should decide [that the contract is frustrated, and the parties are relieved from their obligations]." Omitting [unlawful interference by a third party] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of encouraging unlawful actions by third parties and placing an undue burden on the affected party to bear costs arising from such interference]. Indeed, the opinion in **WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR"** explicitly states that [the disruptions were due to broader social and economic conditions, not specific unlawful actions by a third party, which was crucial to their decision].

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in **WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR"** was clearly designed to prevent [parties from easily escaping their contractual obligations due to economic hardship and market fluctuations]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [parties exploiting economic hardship to escape their obligations without any external unlawful interference]. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The presence of unlawful interference by the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union introduces a distinct legal issue that warrants a different consideration, ensuring that LN Ltd is not unfairly burdened by costs arising from such interference.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the specific covenant or contractual provision addressing increased costs due to external factors (factor m), which was present in the precedent case WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR", requiring this factor for all similar cases of economic hardship and external interference leading to increased costs would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would mean that businesses could be unfairly burdened by costs arising from unlawful actions by third parties, without any recourse. Conversely, not requiring this specific covenant or provision would allow for a more equitable outcome, ensuring that businesses are not unduly penalized for circumstances beyond their control, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and justice in contract law.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the specific covenant or contractual provision addressing increased costs due to external factors (factor m), which was present in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR", we have the additional factor of unlawful interference by the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union (factor n). This unlawful interference, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of economic hardship and external interference leading to increased costs (fact pattern i*), serves a similar function to the specific covenant in the precedent case. Given the presence of this unlawful interference, we submit that the reasoning in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as fairness, justice, and the prevention of unjust enrichment would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR"**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as economic hardship and external interference leading to increased costs. However, it also differs significantly due to the presence of unlawful interference by the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union, which was not a factor in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case, which emphasizes that economic downturns and market conditions are generally risks borne by the tenant, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the unlawful interference in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the doctrine of frustration should be kept within narrow limits to uphold the sanctity of contracts (as argued in the precedent case) and the counterargument that unlawful interference by a third party introduces a distinct legal issue that warrants different consideration.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, justice, and the prevention of unjust enrichment, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the presence of unlawful interference by the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union justifies a different outcome in the current case. LN Ltd should be allowed to recover the additional costs paid to the Union and DSTR Ltd, as these costs arose from unlawful actions beyond their control. Additionally, LN Ltd should not be bound to pay for Gloop plc's testing costs, as this would unfairly shift the burden of regulatory compliance onto LN Ltd without any contractual basis.

Therefore, the decision reached is that LN Ltd can recover the monies paid to the Union and DSTR Ltd and is not bound to pay Gloop plc for the testing costs. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency, taking into account the unique circumstances of unlawful interference in the current case.


# Contract Law: Whether the demand for an increase in haulage rates by DSTR Ltd constitutes economic duress

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Unconscionable Contracts Ordinance Cap. 458 Section 5 Subsection 1
Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2
Trade Descriptions Ordinance Cap. 362 Section 13F Subsection 1

### Major Premise:

1. Unconscionable Contracts Ordinance Cap. 458 Section 5 Subsection 1

   Conditions:
   - A contract for the sale of goods or supply of services in which one of the parties deals as consumer
   - The court finds the contract or any part of the contract to have been unconscionable in the circumstances relating to the contract at the time it was made

   Consequences:
   - The court may refuse to enforce the contract
   - Enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable part
   - Limit the application of, or revise or alter, any unconscionable part so as to avoid any unconscionable result

   Exceptions:
   - None

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - A contract governed by law applicable to the Colony has become impossible of performance or been otherwise frustrated
   - The parties thereto have for that reason been discharged from the further performance of the contract

   Consequences:
   - All sums paid or payable to any party in pursuance of the contract before the time when the parties were so discharged shall, in the case of sums so paid, be recoverable from him as money received by him for the use of the party by whom the sums were paid
   - In the case of sums so payable, cease to be so payable

   Exceptions:
   - If the party to whom the sums were so paid or payable incurred expenses before the time of discharge in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, the court may, if it considers it just to do so having regard to all the circumstances of the case, allow him to retain or, as the case may be, recover the whole or any part of the sums so paid or payable, not being an amount in excess of the expenses so incurred

3. Trade Descriptions Ordinance Cap. 362 Section 13F Subsection 1

   Conditions:
   - A trader engages in relation to a consumer in a commercial practice that is aggressive
   - The commercial practice significantly impairs or is likely significantly to impair the average consumer’s freedom of choice or conduct in relation to the product concerned through the use of harassment, coercion or undue influence
   - It therefore causes or is likely to cause the consumer to make a transactional decision that the consumer would not have made otherwise

   Consequences:
   - The trader commits an offence

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Unconscionable Contracts Ordinance Cap. 458 Section 5 Subsection 1:
   - LN Ltd is not dealing as a consumer in the contracts with DSTR Ltd or Gloop plc.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2:
   - The contract with DSTR Ltd has not become impossible of performance or been otherwise frustrated.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

3. Trade Descriptions Ordinance Cap. 362 Section 13F Subsection 1:
   - DSTR Ltd's demand for an increase in haulage rates and Gloop plc's demand for testing costs do not involve harassment, coercion, or undue influence in a manner that significantly impairs LN Ltd's freedom of choice or conduct.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

### Conclusion:

None of the cited ordinances apply directly to the scenario involving LN Ltd, DSTR Ltd, and Gloop plc. However, the demand for an increase in haulage rates by DSTR Ltd could potentially be examined under the doctrine of economic duress in common law. Economic duress occurs when one party is forced into a contract or contractual modification by the wrongful or improper threats of another, leaving the coerced party with no reasonable alternative but to agree.

Given the facts:
- DSTR Ltd demanded an increase in haulage rates under the threat of ceasing delivery, which would have significantly impacted LN Ltd's business.
- LN Ltd reluctantly agreed and paid £50,000 before finding an alternative carrier.

This situation may constitute economic duress, as LN Ltd was left with no reasonable alternative but to comply with DSTR Ltd's demands. Therefore, LN Ltd may have grounds to recover the £50,000 paid under economic duress.

Regarding Gloop plc's demand for testing costs, this does not appear to involve any form of duress or unconscionable conduct. LN Ltd is not bound to pay for the testing unless they agree to the new terms. If LN Ltd does not agree, Gloop plc may cease to offer credit, but this is a commercial decision rather than a legal obligation.

### Final Conclusion:

LN Ltd may have grounds to recover the £50,000 paid to DSTR Ltd under the doctrine of economic duress. However, LN Ltd is not legally bound to pay Gloop plc for the testing costs unless they agree to the new terms.

### Relevant law:

Malcolm Ernest Gray v Diane Cary Barber Servino

### Major Premise:

1. Malcolm Ernest Gray v Diane Cary Barber Servino

   Conditions:
   - A party is under considerable pressure from financial difficulties.
   - The other party exploits this situation to create a gross disparity of bargaining power.
   - The agreement is made under duress.

   Consequences:
   - The agreement may be voidable on the ground of duress.

   Exceptions:
   - The agreement was made after negotiations between the parties with each having the benefit of independent legal advice.
   - There is no evidence pointing to the agreement having been the result of exploitation of disparity in bargaining power.

### Minor Premise:

1. LN Ltd and DSTR Ltd:

   - LN Ltd was under considerable pressure from financial difficulties due to the £30,000 cost incurred from the Union's actions and the increased insurance costs.
   - DSTR Ltd exploited this situation by demanding an immediate 20% increase in haulage rates, creating a gross disparity of bargaining power.
   - LN Ltd agreed to the increased rates under duress, as they felt they had no alternative to ensure the delivery of their highly inflammable nitrocellulose.
   - The agreement was not made after negotiations with independent legal advice, and there is evidence pointing to the agreement being the result of exploitation of disparity in bargaining power.

2. LN Ltd and the Union:

   - LN Ltd was under considerable pressure from financial difficulties due to the Union's actions.
   - The Union exploited this situation by demanding payments equivalent to an administrator’s monthly salary to allow goods to proceed.
   - LN Ltd made these payments under duress, feeling powerless to resist until the strike was over.
   - The agreement was not made after negotiations with independent legal advice, and there is evidence pointing to the agreement being the result of exploitation of disparity in bargaining power.

3. LN Ltd and Gloop plc:

   - LN Ltd is not under considerable pressure from financial difficulties specifically related to Gloop plc's demand.
   - Gloop plc's demand for £5,000 per annum for testing costs does not create a gross disparity of bargaining power.
   - There is no evidence that the agreement was made under duress.

### Conclusion:

1. The demand for an increase in haulage rates by DSTR Ltd constitutes economic duress. Therefore, the agreement with DSTR Ltd may be voidable on the ground of duress, and LN Ltd can seek to recover the £50,000 paid.

2. The payments made to the Union were also made under duress. Therefore, LN Ltd can seek to recover the £30,000 paid to the Union.

3. LN Ltd is not bound to pay Gloop plc for the testing costs, as the conditions for economic duress are not satisfied in this scenario.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (PAN SUTONG v. BANK OF CHINA LTD)

In the case of PAN SUTONG v. BANK OF CHINA LTD (precedent p), the court examined whether the agreements signed by Pan under alleged duress were enforceable. Pan claimed that he signed the agreements due to threats of death and false imprisonment by BOC representatives. The court ruled that Pan's allegations of duress were inherently improbable and unsupported by contemporaneous documents or objective facts. Consequently, the court found no bona fide dispute on substantial grounds regarding the debt and upheld the enforceability of the agreements (outcome o).

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in PAN SUTONG v. BANK OF CHINA LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Duress**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In PAN SUTONG, Pan alleged that he signed the agreements under threats of death and false imprisonment. In our current case, LN Ltd agreed to pay increased haulage rates under the threat of DSTR Ltd ceasing delivery, which would disrupt their business operations.

- **Legal Concept 2: Illegitimate Pressure**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In PAN SUTONG, the court considered whether the pressure exerted by BOC was illegitimate. In our current case, the pressure exerted by DSTR Ltd to increase haulage rates can be considered illegitimate as it was a threat to breach an existing contract.

- **Legal Concept 3: Compulsion of Will**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In PAN SUTONG, the court examined whether the alleged threats compelled Pan to sign the agreements. In our current case, LN Ltd felt compelled to agree to the increased rates to avoid disruption in their supply chain.

- **Legal Concept 4: Lack of Realistic Alternative**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In PAN SUTONG, the court noted that Pan had no realistic alternative but to sign the agreements due to the alleged threats. In our current case, LN Ltd had no realistic alternative but to agree to the increased rates to ensure timely delivery of their inflammable materials.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (PAN SUTONG v. BANK OF CHINA LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of duress involving illegitimate pressure, compulsion of will, and lack of realistic alternative, the court should decide that the agreement is not enforceable due to duress. This rule was justified in PAN SUTONG v. BANK OF CHINA LTD because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that agreements are entered into freely and without coercion outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially invalidating agreements that were signed under duress.

Applying this rule to our current case, LN Ltd can argue that the payment of increased haulage rates to DSTR Ltd was made under economic duress. The threat to cease delivery, which would disrupt LN Ltd's business operations, constitutes illegitimate pressure. LN Ltd had no realistic alternative but to agree to the increased rates, thereby compelling their will. Therefore, the payment made to DSTR Ltd can be recovered on the grounds of economic duress.

Regarding Gloop plc's demand for LN Ltd to cover the costs of testing, this does not appear to involve duress as there is no immediate threat or compulsion. Instead, it is a commercial negotiation where LN Ltd can choose to accept or reject the terms. Therefore, LN Ltd is not bound to pay for the testing unless they agree to the new terms.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (PAN SUTONG v. BANK OF CHINA LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Duress**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In PAN SUTONG, Pan alleged that he signed the agreements under threats of death and false imprisonment. In our current case, LN Ltd agreed to pay increased haulage rates under the threat of DSTR Ltd ceasing delivery, which would disrupt their business operations.

- **Legal Concept 2: Illegitimate Pressure**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In PAN SUTONG, the court considered whether the pressure exerted by BOC was illegitimate. In our current case, the pressure exerted by DSTR Ltd to increase haulage rates can be considered illegitimate as it was a threat to breach an existing contract.

- **Legal Concept 3: Compulsion of Will**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In PAN SUTONG, the court examined whether the alleged threats compelled Pan to sign the agreements. In our current case, LN Ltd felt compelled to agree to the increased rates to avoid disruption in their supply chain.

- **Legal Concept 4: Lack of Realistic Alternative**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In PAN SUTONG, the court noted that Pan had no realistic alternative but to sign the agreements due to the alleged threats. In our current case, LN Ltd had no realistic alternative but to agree to the increased rates to ensure timely delivery of their inflammable materials.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in PAN SUTONG v. BANK OF CHINA LTD. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Fairness in Commercial Transactions**: By recognizing the payment made under economic duress as recoverable, the court would uphold the principle that agreements and payments should be made freely and without coercion. This promotes fairness and integrity in commercial transactions.

2. **Deterring Unlawful Conduct**: Allowing LN Ltd to recover the payment would deter other parties from using illegitimate pressure to extract payments or concessions. This would contribute to a more stable and predictable business environment.

3. **Protecting Vulnerable Parties**: Recognizing economic duress in this context protects businesses, especially smaller ones, from being exploited by more powerful entities. This aligns with the broader legal principle of protecting parties from undue influence and coercion.

4. **Consistency in Legal Application**: Applying the same legal principles consistently across similar cases ensures predictability and reliability in the legal system. This consistency is crucial for businesses to understand their rights and obligations.

Therefore, LN Ltd should be able to recover the £50,000 paid to DSTR Ltd on the grounds of economic duress. Regarding Gloop plc's demand for LN Ltd to cover the costs of testing, this does not involve duress as there is no immediate threat or compulsion. Instead, it is a commercial negotiation where LN Ltd can choose to accept or reject the terms. Thus, LN Ltd is not bound to pay for the testing unless they agree to the new terms.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **PAN SUTONG v. BANK OF CHINA LTD**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of **contemporaneous documents and objective facts** that contradicted Pan's allegations of duress. These documents and facts were key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling (upholding the enforceability of the agreements) outweighed any potential drawbacks because they provided clear evidence that Pan's claims were not credible. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of **contemporaneous documents and objective facts** is notably absent as there is no indication that LN Ltd has any such documents or objective facts to support or contradict the claim of economic duress by DSTR Ltd.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor **(the highly inflammable nature of the goods and the immediate threat to cease delivery)** that was not present in **PAN SUTONG v. BANK OF CHINA LTD**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of duress because the immediate threat to cease delivery of highly inflammable materials poses a significant risk to LN Ltd's business operations and safety. Due to this factor, applying the same outcome (upholding the enforceability of the agreement) in our case would have more negative consequences such as **potential business disruption and safety hazards** than positive ones, unlike in **PAN SUTONG v. BANK OF CHINA LTD** because the immediate threat and the nature of the goods create a more compelling case for economic duress.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from **PAN SUTONG v. BANK OF CHINA LTD** should be stated as "When both [the shared fact pattern of duress involving illegitimate pressure, compulsion of will, and lack of realistic alternative] and [the presence of contemporaneous documents and objective facts] are present, the court should decide [to uphold the enforceability of the agreement]." Omitting [the presence of contemporaneous documents and objective facts] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of upholding agreements that were genuinely signed under duress without sufficient evidence to the contrary]. Indeed, the opinion in **PAN SUTONG v. BANK OF CHINA LTD** explicitly states that [the lack of contemporaneous documents and objective facts was crucial to their decision, as it provided clear evidence that Pan's claims were not credible].

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in **PAN SUTONG v. BANK OF CHINA LTD** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of invalidating agreements that were signed freely and without coercion, based on unsubstantiated claims of duress]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [upholding agreements that were signed freely and without coercion without sufficient evidence to the contrary]. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. In our case, the immediate threat to cease delivery of highly inflammable materials and the absence of contemporaneous documents or objective facts to support or contradict the claim of economic duress create a more compelling case for economic duress. Thus, LN Ltd should be able to recover the £50,000 paid to DSTR Ltd on the grounds of economic duress.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction

While it's true that our case lacks the presence of contemporaneous documents and objective facts, which was present in the precedent case PAN SUTONG v. BANK OF CHINA LTD, requiring this factor for all similar cases of economic duress would lead to the undesirable consequence of potentially upholding agreements that were genuinely signed under duress without sufficient evidence to the contrary. Conversely, not requiring contemporaneous documents and objective facts would allow for a more nuanced and fair assessment of economic duress claims, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, such as protecting parties from undue influence and coercion and ensuring fairness in commercial transactions.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution

Although our case lacks the presence of contemporaneous documents and objective facts, which was present in PAN SUTONG v. BANK OF CHINA LTD, we have the additional factor of the highly inflammable nature of the goods and the immediate threat to cease delivery. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of economic duress involving illegitimate pressure, compulsion of will, and lack of realistic alternative, serves a similar function to the contemporaneous documents and objective facts in the precedent case. Given the presence of the immediate threat to cease delivery of highly inflammable materials, we submit that the reasoning in PAN SUTONG v. BANK OF CHINA LTD still applies, as the positive effects on ensuring fairness in commercial transactions and protecting vulnerable parties would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. Therefore, LN Ltd should be able to recover the £50,000 paid to DSTR Ltd on the grounds of economic duress.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **PAN SUTONG v. BANK OF CHINA LTD**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of economic duress involving illegitimate pressure, compulsion of will, and lack of realistic alternative. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of contemporaneous documents and objective facts in the current case and the immediate threat to cease delivery of highly inflammable materials.

The proposed legal rule from **PAN SUTONG v. BANK OF CHINA LTD**—that agreements signed under duress are not enforceable—finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of contemporaneous documents and objective facts in establishing the credibility of duress claims (as emphasized in the precedent) and the unique circumstances of the current case involving the immediate threat to cease delivery of hazardous materials.

Considering the underlying legal principles of ensuring fairness in commercial transactions, protecting parties from undue influence and coercion, and maintaining legal consistency, we conclude that LN Ltd should be able to recover the £50,000 paid to DSTR Ltd on the grounds of economic duress. The immediate threat to cease delivery of highly inflammable materials and the lack of realistic alternatives for LN Ltd create a compelling case for economic duress, even in the absence of contemporaneous documents and objective facts. This decision aligns with the principles of justice and legal consistency, ensuring that agreements and payments are made freely and without coercion. 

Regarding Gloop plc's demand for LN Ltd to cover the costs of testing, this does not involve duress as there is no immediate threat or compulsion. Instead, it is a commercial negotiation where LN Ltd can choose to accept or reject the terms. Thus, LN Ltd is not bound to pay for the testing unless they agree to the new terms.


# Contract Law: Whether the payment of £50,000 to DSTR Ltd can be recovered on the grounds of economic duress

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2 and 3

### Major Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - A contract governed by law applicable to the Colony has become impossible of performance or been otherwise frustrated
   - The parties thereto have for that reason been discharged from the further performance of the contract

   Consequences:
   - All sums paid or payable to any party in pursuance of the contract before the time when the parties were so discharged shall, in the case of sums so paid, be recoverable from him as money received by him for the use of the party by whom the sums were paid
   - In the case of sums so payable, cease to be so payable

   Exceptions:
   - If the party to whom the sums were so paid or payable incurred expenses before the time of discharge in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, the court may, if it considers it just to do so having regard to all the circumstances of the case, allow him to retain or, as the case may be, recover the whole or any part of the sums so paid or payable, not being an amount in excess of the expenses so incurred

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3

   Conditions:
   - Any party to the contract has, by reason of anything done by any other party thereto in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, obtained a valuable benefit (other than a payment of money to which subsection (2) applies) before the time of discharge

   Consequences:
   - There shall be recoverable from him by the said other party such sum (if any), not exceeding the value of the said benefit to the party obtaining it, as the court considers just, having regard to all the circumstances of the case

### Minor Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2:
- LN Ltd and DSTR Ltd have a contract for the delivery of nitrocellulose.
- The contract has not become impossible of performance or been otherwise frustrated.
- The parties have not been discharged from the further performance of the contract.
- Therefore, this section does not apply.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3:
- LN Ltd and DSTR Ltd have a contract for the delivery of nitrocellulose.
- DSTR Ltd demanded an increase in their haulage rates of 20 per cent with immediate effect, otherwise they would cease delivery forthwith.
- LN Ltd reluctantly agreed and paid £50,000 before they could find an alternative carrier.
- DSTR Ltd obtained a valuable benefit (the increased payment) by reason of the performance of the contract.
- The court may consider it just to allow LN Ltd to recover the sum paid, not exceeding the value of the benefit obtained by DSTR Ltd.

### Conclusion:

Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3 applies, and the court may consider it just to allow LN Ltd to recover the sum paid to DSTR Ltd, not exceeding the value of the benefit obtained by DSTR Ltd. Therefore, LN Ltd may be able to recover the £50,000 paid to DSTR Ltd.

### Major Premise:

1. Malcolm Ernest Gray v Diane Cary Barber Servino

   Conditions:
   - A party consents to an agreement or order under duress
   - The duress involves pressure that is illegitimate or unlawful
   - The pressure is a significant cause inducing the party to enter into the agreement or order

   Consequences:
   - The agreement or order may be set aside or varied

   Exceptions:
   - The party had the benefit of independent legal advice
   - The agreement or order was not the result of exploitation of disparity in bargaining power

### Minor Premise:

1. Payment to the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union:
   - LN Ltd consented to paying the Union under duress.
   - The duress involved pressure that is illegitimate or unlawful (wrongful interference with goods).
   - The pressure was a significant cause inducing LN Ltd to make the payments.
   - LN Ltd did not have the benefit of independent legal advice.
   - The payment was the result of exploitation of disparity in bargaining power (LN Ltd felt powerless to resist).

   Therefore, the payment to the Union may be set aside or varied.

2. Payment to DSTR Ltd:
   - LN Ltd consented to the increased haulage rates under duress.
   - The duress involved pressure that is illegitimate or unlawful (threat to cease delivery).
   - The pressure was a significant cause inducing LN Ltd to agree to the increased rates.
   - LN Ltd did not have the benefit of independent legal advice.
   - The agreement was the result of exploitation of disparity in bargaining power (DSTR Ltd took advantage of LN Ltd’s situation).

   Therefore, the payment to DSTR Ltd may be set aside or varied.

### Conclusion:

The payments made by LN Ltd to the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union and DSTR Ltd can be recovered on the grounds of economic duress. LN Ltd is not bound to pay Gloop plc for the testing costs as the scenario does not indicate any duress or illegitimate pressure in that agreement.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (SHUN HING ELECTRONIC TRADING CO LTD v. SUNRISE AIR CONDITIONING CO LTD AND OTHERS)
In the case of SHUN HING ELECTRONIC TRADING CO LTD v. SUNRISE AIR CONDITIONING CO LTD AND OTHERS (precedent p), the court dealt with issues of misrepresentation and undue influence. The 3rd Defendant claimed she signed a guarantee under misrepresentation and undue influence. The court found her evidence inconsistent and evasive, concluding that she had not been misled or unduly influenced. The court ruled that the 3rd Defendant's defence of misrepresentation and undue influence could not stand, and she was bound by the guarantee she signed (outcome o).

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in SHUN HING ELECTRONIC TRADING CO LTD v. SUNRISE AIR CONDITIONING CO LTD AND OTHERS and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Economic Duress**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In SHUN HING, the 3rd Defendant claimed she was coerced into signing the guarantee due to undue influence, which is a form of economic duress. In our current case, LN Ltd was coerced into paying £50,000 to DSTR Ltd under the threat of ceasing delivery, which constitutes economic duress.

- **Legal Concept 2: Misrepresentation**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In SHUN HING, the 3rd Defendant alleged misrepresentation regarding the nature of the document she signed. In our current case, while misrepresentation is not directly alleged, the coercive demand by DSTR Ltd can be seen as a form of misrepresentation of their contractual obligations.

- **Legal Concept 3: Burden of Proof**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In SHUN HING, the burden was on the 3rd Defendant to prove misrepresentation and undue influence. Similarly, in our current case, LN Ltd would need to prove that the payment to DSTR Ltd was made under economic duress.

- **Legal Concept 4: Inconsistent Statements and Evasiveness**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In SHUN HING, the court found the 3rd Defendant's statements inconsistent and evasive, undermining her credibility. In our current case, if DSTR Ltd's demands and justifications for the increased rates are inconsistent or evasive, it could similarly undermine their position.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (SHUN HING ELECTRONIC TRADING CO LTD v. SUNRISE AIR CONDITIONING CO LTD AND OTHERS)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern involving economic duress, misrepresentation, the burden of proof on the claimant, and inconsistent or evasive statements by the defendant, the court should decide in favor of the claimant seeking to recover payments made under duress. This rule was justified in SHUN HING ELECTRONIC TRADING CO LTD v. SUNRISE AIR CONDITIONING CO LTD AND OTHERS because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that parties are not unfairly coerced into agreements and maintaining the integrity of contractual obligations outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially invalidating agreements based on unsubstantiated claims of duress. 

Therefore, applying this rule to our current case, LN Ltd should be able to recover the £50,000 paid to DSTR Ltd if they can prove that the payment was made under economic duress, and they are not bound to pay Gloop plc for the testing costs unless it was part of their original contractual agreement.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (SHUN HING ELECTRONIC TRADING CO LTD v. SUNRISE AIR CONDITIONING CO LTD AND OTHERS) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Economic Duress**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In SHUN HING, the 3rd Defendant claimed she was coerced into signing the guarantee due to undue influence, which is a form of economic duress. In our current case, LN Ltd was coerced into paying £50,000 to DSTR Ltd under the threat of ceasing delivery, which constitutes economic duress.

- **Legal Concept 2: Misrepresentation**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In SHUN HING, the 3rd Defendant alleged misrepresentation regarding the nature of the document she signed. In our current case, while misrepresentation is not directly alleged, the coercive demand by DSTR Ltd can be seen as a form of misrepresentation of their contractual obligations.

- **Legal Concept 3: Burden of Proof**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In SHUN HING, the burden was on the 3rd Defendant to prove misrepresentation and undue influence. Similarly, in our current case, LN Ltd would need to prove that the payment to DSTR Ltd was made under economic duress.

- **Legal Concept 4: Inconsistent Statements and Evasiveness**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In SHUN HING, the court found the 3rd Defendant's statements inconsistent and evasive, undermining her credibility. In our current case, if DSTR Ltd's demands and justifications for the increased rates are inconsistent or evasive, it could similarly undermine their position.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in SHUN HING ELECTRONIC TRADING CO LTD v. SUNRISE AIR CONDITIONING CO LTD AND OTHERS. This decision would be justified because, as in SHUN HING, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Fairness in Contractual Relationships**: By allowing LN Ltd to recover the £50,000 paid under economic duress, the court would reinforce the principle that parties should not be coerced into agreements through threats or undue pressure. This upholds the integrity of contractual obligations and ensures that agreements are entered into freely and voluntarily.

2. **Deterring Unlawful Conduct**: A ruling in favor of LN Ltd would serve as a deterrent to other parties who might consider using economic duress or misrepresentation to extract unfair payments or concessions. It sends a clear message that such conduct will not be tolerated and that the courts will provide remedies to those who are wronged.

3. **Promoting Commercial Certainty**: By adhering to established legal principles and precedents, the court would promote commercial certainty and predictability. Businesses can operate with greater confidence knowing that the legal system will protect them from coercive and unfair practices.

4. **Protecting Vulnerable Parties**: The decision would protect parties who may be in a weaker bargaining position from being exploited by those with greater power or resources. This aligns with the broader principles of equity and justice in contract law.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in SHUN HING, it would have the positive effects of ensuring fairness, deterring unlawful conduct, promoting commercial certainty, and protecting vulnerable parties.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **SHUN HING ELECTRONIC TRADING CO LTD v. SUNRISE AIR CONDITIONING CO LTD AND OTHERS**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the **inconsistent and evasive statements** of the 3rd Defendant. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—upholding the integrity of contractual obligations and deterring false claims of misrepresentation and undue influence—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it demonstrated that the 3rd Defendant's claims were not credible. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of **inconsistent and evasive statements** is notably absent as there is no indication that DSTR Ltd's demands and justifications for the increased rates were inconsistent or evasive. Instead, DSTR Ltd's demands were straightforward, albeit coercive.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor **(the presence of a pre-existing contract with no price variation clause)** that was not present in **SHUN HING ELECTRONIC TRADING CO LTD v. SUNRISE AIR CONDITIONING CO LTD AND OTHERS**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of economic duress because the pre-existing contract explicitly set the terms of the agreement, including the price, which DSTR Ltd later attempted to alter under duress. Due to this pre-existing contract, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the enforceability of clear contractual terms and encouraging parties to disregard contractual obligations under economic pressure, unlike in **SHUN HING ELECTRONIC TRADING CO LTD v. SUNRISE AIR CONDITIONING CO LTD AND OTHERS** because the latter case did not involve a clear pre-existing contractual term being altered under duress.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from **SHUN HING ELECTRONIC TRADING CO LTD v. SUNRISE AIR CONDITIONING CO LTD AND OTHERS** should be stated as: "When both [the presence of economic duress] and [inconsistent and evasive statements by the defendant] are present, the court should decide [in favor of the claimant seeking to recover payments made under duress]." Omitting [inconsistent and evasive statements by the defendant] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of undermining the enforceability of clear contractual terms and encouraging parties to disregard contractual obligations under economic pressure]. Indeed, the opinion in **SHUN HING ELECTRONIC TRADING CO LTD v. SUNRISE AIR CONDITIONING CO LTD AND OTHERS** explicitly states that [the inconsistencies and evasiveness in the 3rd Defendant's statements were crucial to their decision].

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in **SHUN HING ELECTRONIC TRADING CO LTD v. SUNRISE AIR CONDITIONING CO LTD AND OTHERS** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties making unsubstantiated claims of misrepresentation and undue influence to escape contractual obligations]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [unsubstantiated claims of misrepresentation and undue influence] occurring because LN Ltd's claim is based on a clear and coercive demand by DSTR Ltd, which is straightforward and not evasive. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of **inconsistent and evasive statements by the defendant**, which was present in the precedent case **SHUN HING ELECTRONIC TRADING CO LTD v. SUNRISE AIR CONDITIONING CO LTD AND OTHERS**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of **economic duress** would lead to the undesirable consequence of allowing parties to exploit their contractual partners through coercive demands without facing legal repercussions, simply because they were straightforward in their demands. Conversely, not requiring **inconsistent and evasive statements** would allow for the desirable outcome of protecting parties from economic duress and ensuring that contracts are entered into freely and voluntarily, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and equity in contract law.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks **inconsistent and evasive statements by the defendant**, which was present in **SHUN HING ELECTRONIC TRADING CO LTD v. SUNRISE AIR CONDITIONING CO LTD AND OTHERS**, we have the additional factor of **a pre-existing contract with no price variation clause**. This **pre-existing contract**, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of **economic duress**, serves a similar function to **inconsistent and evasive statements** in the precedent case. Given the presence of **a pre-existing contract with no price variation clause**, we submit that the reasoning in **SHUN HING ELECTRONIC TRADING CO LTD v. SUNRISE AIR CONDITIONING CO LTD AND OTHERS** still applies, as the positive effects on **ensuring fairness in contractual relationships and deterring unlawful conduct** would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **SHUN HING ELECTRONIC TRADING CO LTD v. SUNRISE AIR CONDITIONING CO LTD AND OTHERS**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly the presence of economic duress and the burden of proof on the claimant. However, it also differs in significant ways, notably the absence of inconsistent and evasive statements by the defendant and the presence of a pre-existing contract with no price variation clause.

The proposed legal rule of "When both [the presence of economic duress] and [inconsistent and evasive statements by the defendant] are present, the court should decide [in favor of the claimant seeking to recover payments made under duress]" finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that requiring inconsistent and evasive statements for all cases of economic duress could allow parties to exploit their contractual partners through coercive demands without facing legal repercussions.

Considering the underlying legal principles of ensuring fairness in contractual relationships, deterring unlawful conduct, and promoting commercial certainty, we conclude that LN Ltd should be able to recover the £50,000 paid to DSTR Ltd. The presence of a pre-existing contract with no price variation clause serves a similar function to inconsistent and evasive statements in the precedent case, as it underscores the coercive nature of DSTR Ltd's demands. Therefore, the positive effects on ensuring fairness and deterring unlawful conduct outweigh any potential negative consequences.

Regarding Gloop plc, LN Ltd is not bound to pay for the testing costs unless it was part of their original contractual agreement. The demand for additional payment for testing costs constitutes a variation of the original contract, which requires mutual consent.

In conclusion, LN Ltd can recover the £50,000 paid to DSTR Ltd on the grounds of economic duress, and they are not bound to pay Gloop plc for the testing costs unless it was part of their original contractual agreement. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency.

### Major Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 52 Subsections 1-3

   Conditions:
   - The buyer wrongfully neglects or refuses to accept and pay for the goods.
   - The seller maintains an action against the buyer for damages for non-acceptance.

   Consequences:
   - The measure of damages is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the buyer’s breach of contract.
   - Where there is an available market for the goods in question, the measure of damages is prima facie to be ascertained by the difference between the contract price and the market or current price at the time or times when the goods ought to have been accepted, or, if no time was fixed for acceptance, then at the time of the neglect or refusal to accept.

   Exceptions:
   - None

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 53 Subsections 1-3

   Conditions:
   - The seller wrongfully neglects or refuses to deliver the goods to the buyer.
   - The buyer maintains an action against the seller for damages for non-delivery.

   Consequences:
   - The measure of damages is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the seller’s breach of contract.
   - Where there is an available market for the goods in question, the measure of damages is prima facie to be ascertained by the difference between the contract price and the market or current price of the goods at the time or times when they ought to have been delivered, or, if no time was fixed for delivery, then at the time of the neglect or refusal to deliver.

3. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 55 Subsections 1-4

   Conditions:
   - There is a breach of warranty by the seller.
   - The buyer elects, or is compelled, to treat any breach of a condition on the part of the seller as a breach of warranty.

   Consequences:
   - The buyer is not, by reason only of such breach of warranty, entitled to reject the goods.
   - The buyer may set up against the seller the breach of warranty in diminution or extinction of the price.
   - The buyer may maintain an action against the seller for damages for the breach of warranty.
   - The measure of damages for breach of warranty is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the breach of warranty.
   - In the case of breach of warranty of quality, such loss is prima facie the difference between the value of the goods at the time of delivery to the buyer and the value they would have had if they had answered to the warranty.
   - The fact that the buyer has set up the breach of warranty in diminution or extinction of the price does not prevent him from maintaining an action for the same breach of warranty if he has suffered further damage.

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 52 Subsections 1-3:
   - DSTR Ltd has demanded an increase in haulage rates and threatened to cease delivery if not agreed.
   - LN Ltd reluctantly agreed and paid £50,000 before finding an alternative carrier.
   - This does not constitute a wrongful neglect or refusal to accept and pay for goods by LN Ltd.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 53 Subsections 1-3:
   - DSTR Ltd threatened to cease delivery unless LN Ltd agreed to a 20% increase in haulage rates.
   - LN Ltd agreed and paid £50,000 to avoid disruption.
   - This does not constitute a wrongful neglect or refusal to deliver goods by DSTR Ltd as LN Ltd agreed to the new terms.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

3. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 55 Subsections 1-4:
   - There is no indication of a breach of warranty by DSTR Ltd or Gloop plc.
   - The issue with DSTR Ltd is related to a demand for increased rates, not a breach of warranty.
   - The issue with Gloop plc is related to additional costs for testing, not a breach of warranty.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

### Conclusion:

None of the sections from the Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 apply to the scenario involving LN Ltd, DSTR Ltd, and Gloop plc. The payments made to the Union and DSTR Ltd cannot be recovered under the Sale of Goods Ordinance, and LN Ltd is not bound to pay Gloop plc for testing under the provided legal framework.

## Deductive Reasoning: ca

### Relevant law:

Chong Cheng Lin Courtney v Cathay Pacific Airways Limited

### Major Premise:

1. Chong Cheng Lin Courtney v Cathay Pacific Airways Limited

   Conditions:
   - The parties agree to vary the contract of employment by the new provisions
   - There is adequate consideration to support the agreement to vary

   Consequences:
   - The new provisions become part of the contract of employment

   Exceptions:
   - There is no intention to be legally bound
   - The variation lacks adequate consideration

### Minor Premise:

1. Agreement to vary the contract:
   - DSTR Ltd demanded an increase in their haulage rates of 20 per cent with immediate effect.
   - LN Ltd reluctantly agreed to this demand and paid £50,000 before they could find an alternative carrier.
   - This indicates that there was an agreement to vary the contract.

2. Adequate consideration:
   - The consideration for the variation was the continued delivery of nitrocellulose by DSTR Ltd, which is a highly inflammable substance and crucial for LN Ltd's operations.
   - The payment of £50,000 by LN Ltd can be seen as adequate consideration for the variation.

3. Intention to be legally bound:
   - Both parties acted in a manner that indicates an intention to be legally bound by the new terms.
   - LN Ltd paid the increased amount, and DSTR Ltd continued to provide the delivery services.

4. Exceptions:
   - There is no indication that there was no intention to be legally bound.
   - The variation does not lack adequate consideration as the payment of £50,000 and the continued delivery services constitute adequate consideration.

### Conclusion:

The contract between LN Ltd and DSTR Ltd can be varied as the conditions for variation are satisfied and the exceptions do not apply. Therefore, the new provisions, including the increased haulage rates, become part of the contract. LN Ltd is not entitled to recover the £50,000 paid to DSTR Ltd.

Regarding the payment to the Union, this is a separate issue involving potential unlawful interference with goods, which may require a different legal analysis outside the scope of the provided major premise. As for Gloop plc, LN Ltd is not bound to pay for the testing costs unless there is a variation of the contract supported by adequate consideration and mutual agreement.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (LKF v. ZTISL)

In the case of LKF v. ZTISL [2024] HKCFI 424; HCSD 8/2023 (31 January 2024) (precedent p), the court ruled that the applicant failed to establish an arguable case for setting aside a statutory demand on the grounds of unconscionable bargain and duress. The court emphasized that the burden of proof for setting aside a statutory demand is higher than that for opposing an Order 14 application for summary judgment. Specifically, the applicant must show a substantial defence, meaning a defence of substance, rather than merely asserting the existence of a dispute or counterclaim.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in LKF v. ZTISL and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Unconscionable Bargain**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In LKF v. ZTISL, the applicant argued that he was at a serious disadvantage due to lack of education and legal advice, and that the terms of the agreement were oppressive. Similarly, in our current case, LN Ltd may argue that DSTR Ltd's demand for a 20% increase in haulage rates constitutes an unconscionable bargain due to the sudden and significant financial pressure placed on LN Ltd.
  
- **Duress**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In LKF v. ZTISL, the applicant claimed that he signed the agreement under duress due to threats of termination of the working relationship. In our current case, LN Ltd could argue that DSTR Ltd's threat to cease delivery unless a 20% increase in haulage rates was agreed upon constitutes economic duress, as LN Ltd felt compelled to agree to the demand to avoid disruption in their supply chain.

- **Illegitimate Pressure**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In LKF v. ZTISL, the court examined whether the pressure exerted by the respondent was illegitimate. In our current case, the pressure exerted by DSTR Ltd to increase haulage rates and the Union's demand for payments to allow goods to pass through could be considered illegitimate.

- **Affirmation of Contract**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In LKF v. ZTISL, the court noted that the applicant had affirmed the agreement by continuing to earn commissions under it. Similarly, in our current case, LN Ltd's payment of £50,000 to DSTR Ltd and continued use of their services could be seen as an affirmation of the modified contract terms.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (LKF v. ZTISL)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a party being at a serious disadvantage, facing illegitimate pressure, and subsequently affirming the contract, the court should decide that the contract modification is not voidable on the grounds of unconscionable bargain or duress. This rule was justified in LKF v. ZTISL because the positive effects of requiring substantial evidence to set aside a statutory demand (E+) on the underlying values and principles of the law, such as ensuring the stability and enforceability of commercial agreements, outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially upholding agreements made under pressure. 

In our current case, applying this rule would mean that LN Ltd may not be able to recover the monies paid to DSTR Ltd and the Union, as they have affirmed the contract by continuing to operate under the modified terms. Additionally, LN Ltd may be bound to Gloop plc to pay for the testing costs, as the pressure exerted by Gloop plc does not appear to be illegitimate or unconscionable.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (LKF v. ZTISL) are present:

- **Unconscionable Bargain**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: LN Ltd may argue that DSTR Ltd's demand for a 20% increase in haulage rates constitutes an unconscionable bargain due to the sudden and significant financial pressure placed on LN Ltd. However, similar to LKF v. ZTISL, LN Ltd would need to provide substantial evidence of a serious disadvantage, oppressive terms, and morally culpable conduct by DSTR Ltd, which appears lacking.

- **Duress**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: LN Ltd could argue that DSTR Ltd's threat to cease delivery unless a 20% increase in haulage rates was agreed upon constitutes economic duress. However, as in LKF v. ZTISL, LN Ltd would need to show that the pressure was illegitimate and that they had no realistic practical alternative but to submit to the pressure. The evidence suggests that LN Ltd continued to operate under the modified terms, indicating affirmation of the contract.

- **Illegitimate Pressure**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: The pressure exerted by DSTR Ltd to increase haulage rates and the Union's demand for payments to allow goods to pass through could be considered illegitimate. However, LN Ltd would need to provide evidence of bad faith or unlawful threats, which is not clearly established in the current case.

- **Affirmation of Contract**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: LN Ltd's payment of £50,000 to DSTR Ltd and continued use of their services could be seen as an affirmation of the modified contract terms. Similar to LKF v. ZTISL, where the applicant continued to earn commissions under the agreement, LN Ltd's actions suggest acceptance of the new terms.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in LKF v. ZTISL. This decision would be justified because, as in LKF v. ZTISL, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Stability and Enforceability of Commercial Agreements**: Upholding the modified contract terms ensures that commercial agreements remain stable and enforceable, which is crucial for business certainty and economic stability.

2. **Burden of Proof**: Requiring substantial evidence to set aside a contract modification on grounds of unconscionable bargain or duress ensures that parties cannot easily escape their contractual obligations without clear and convincing proof of illegitimate pressure or serious disadvantage.

3. **Commercial Fairness**: While LN Ltd may feel aggrieved by the increased costs, the court's decision would emphasize the importance of negotiating and affirming contract terms with full knowledge and understanding, promoting fairness in commercial dealings.

Therefore, LN Ltd may not be able to recover the monies paid to DSTR Ltd and the Union, as they have affirmed the contract by continuing to operate under the modified terms. Additionally, LN Ltd may be bound to Gloop plc to pay for the testing costs, as the pressure exerted by Gloop plc does not appear to be illegitimate or unconscionable.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case LKF v. ZTISL, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the applicant's failure to provide substantial evidence of a serious disadvantage, oppressive terms, and morally culpable conduct by the respondent. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as maintaining the stability and enforceability of commercial agreements, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it emphasized the importance of requiring clear and convincing proof to set aside a statutory demand. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of the applicant's failure to provide substantial evidence is notably absent as LN Ltd has provided some evidence of economic duress and the significant financial pressure placed on them by DSTR Ltd's sudden demand for a 20% increase in haulage rates.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor of the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union's wrongful interference with goods, which was not present in LKF v. ZTISL. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the Union's actions constitute an unlawful interference with LN Ltd's goods, which adds an element of illegitimacy and coercion that was not considered in the precedent case. Due to this wrongful interference, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as undermining the rule of law and allowing unlawful actions to go unchallenged, than positive ones, unlike in LKF v. ZTISL. This is because the Union's actions directly impacted LN Ltd's ability to conduct business and forced them to incur additional costs under duress.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from LKF v. ZTISL should be stated as "When both the fact pattern of a party being at a serious disadvantage, facing illegitimate pressure, and subsequently affirming the contract (i*) and the presence of wrongful interference with goods (m) are present, the court should decide that the contract modification is voidable on the grounds of unconscionable bargain or duress (o)." Omitting the wrongful interference with goods (m) from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence (q) of allowing unlawful actions to go unchallenged and undermining the rule of law. Indeed, the opinion in LKF v. ZTISL explicitly states that the applicant's failure to provide substantial evidence of a serious disadvantage, oppressive terms, and morally culpable conduct was crucial to their decision. Including the wrongful interference with goods (m) prevents this undesirable outcome by ensuring that unlawful actions are appropriately addressed and do not coerce parties into unfair agreements.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in LKF v. ZTISL was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence (u) of parties easily escaping their contractual obligations without clear and convincing proof of illegitimate pressure or serious disadvantage. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence (u) occurring because the presence of wrongful interference with goods (m) by the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union adds an element of illegitimacy and coercion that was not considered in the precedent case. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should recognize the wrongful interference and the economic duress faced by LN Ltd, allowing them to recover the monies paid to the Union and DSTR Ltd and not binding them to Gloop plc's additional testing costs.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of the applicant's failure to provide substantial evidence of a serious disadvantage, oppressive terms, and morally culpable conduct, which was present in the precedent case LKF v. ZTISL, requiring this factor for all similar cases of economic duress and unconscionable bargain would lead to the undesirable consequence of allowing parties to exploit their superior bargaining position without accountability. Conversely, not requiring this factor would allow for a more equitable assessment of the circumstances, ensuring that parties who are genuinely coerced into unfair agreements due to illegitimate pressure can seek redress. This better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, which aim to protect parties from unfair and coercive practices in contractual relationships.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of the applicant's failure to provide substantial evidence of a serious disadvantage, oppressive terms, and morally culpable conduct, which was present in LKF v. ZTISL, we have the additional factor of wrongful interference with goods by the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union. This wrongful interference, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of economic duress and significant financial pressure, serves a similar function to the missing factor in the precedent case. Given the presence of this wrongful interference, we submit that the reasoning in LKF v. ZTISL still applies, as the positive effects on legal values, such as upholding the rule of law and preventing unlawful coercion, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to LKF v. ZTISL, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of economic duress and the assertion of an unconscionable bargain. However, it also differs significantly due to the wrongful interference with goods by the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union, which was not a factor in LKF v. ZTISL.

The proposed legal rule from LKF v. ZTISL, which requires substantial evidence of a serious disadvantage, oppressive terms, and morally culpable conduct to set aside a statutory demand, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the wrongful interference with goods in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that LN Ltd has provided some evidence of economic duress and the significant financial pressure placed on them by DSTR Ltd's sudden demand for a 20% increase in haulage rates. On the other hand, the argument that LN Ltd's continued operation under the modified terms suggests affirmation of the contract is also compelling.

Considering the underlying legal principles of ensuring the stability and enforceability of commercial agreements, while also protecting parties from unfair and coercive practices, we conclude that the wrongful interference with goods by the Union adds a significant element of illegitimacy and coercion that justifies setting aside the contract modification.

Therefore, LN Ltd should be able to recover the monies paid to the Union and DSTR Ltd, as the payments were made under duress and wrongful interference. Additionally, LN Ltd should not be bound to Gloop plc to pay for the testing costs, as the pressure exerted by Gloop plc does not appear to be illegitimate or unconscionable.

This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by addressing the wrongful interference and economic duress faced by LN Ltd. The key factors influencing this outcome include the presence of wrongful interference with goods, the significant financial pressure, and the need to uphold the rule of law and prevent unlawful actions from coercing parties into unfair agreements.

   - A contract for the sale of goods or supply of services exists
   - One of the parties deals as a consumer
   - The court finds the contract or any part of the contract to have been unconscionable in the circumstances relating to the contract at the time it was made

   Consequences:
   - The court may refuse to enforce the contract
   - Enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable part
   - Limit the application of, or revise or alter, any unconscionable part so as to avoid any unconscionable result

LN Ltd is not bound to pay for the additional testing costs demanded by Gloop plc. Additionally, the monies paid to the Union and DSTR Ltd may not be recoverable under the provided legal framework.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCCT 4/2018)
In the case of HCCT 4/2018 IN THE MATTER of the Arbitration Ordinance (Cap 609) and IN THE MATTER of an Arbitration (precedent p), the court ruled that the arbitrator's decision should be respected unless it is "obviously wrong" or the issue is of general importance. The court emphasized the importance of finality in arbitration and the high threshold for granting leave to appeal on questions of law arising out of an award.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCCT 4/2018 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Contractual Interpretation**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In HCCT 4/2018, the court examined the interpretation of specific contractual clauses (e.g., Para 1(f) regarding idling deductions). In our current case, we need to interpret the contractual terms between LN Ltd and Gloop plc regarding the additional testing costs.

- **Legal Concept 2: Condition Precedent**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** In HCCT 4/2018, the court considered whether the conditions precedent (e.g., notice requirements under Clause 21) were met. In our current case, we need to determine whether the demand for additional testing costs by Gloop plc constitutes a variation of the contract and whether any conditions precedent for such a variation were met.

- **Legal Concept 3: Economic Duress**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In HCCT 4/2018, the court did not directly address economic duress, but the principles of fairness and the balance of power in contractual relationships were implicit in the court's reasoning. In our current case, LN Ltd's payments to the Union and DSTR Ltd may involve elements of economic duress, where LN Ltd felt compelled to pay under threat of significant business disruption.

- **Legal Concept 4: Finality and Arbitration**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** In HCCT 4/2018, the court emphasized the finality of arbitration decisions and the limited grounds for court intervention. In our current case, while not directly involving arbitration, the principle of respecting agreed contractual terms and the high threshold for challenging them is relevant.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCCT 4/2018)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern involving the interpretation of contractual terms and conditions precedent, the court should decide in favor of upholding the arbitrator's or original decision unless it is "obviously wrong" or of general importance. This rule was justified in HCCT 4/2018 because the positive effects (E+) of respecting the finality of arbitration and contractual agreements outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potential errors in specific cases. This promotes certainty and stability in commercial relationships, which are underlying values and principles of contract law. 

Applying this rule to our current case:
- **Payments to the Union:** LN Ltd may argue that these payments were made under economic duress and seek recovery. However, the principle of finality and respecting contractual terms suggests that unless the payments were "obviously wrong" or involved significant legal issues, recovery may be challenging.
- **Payments to DSTR Ltd:** Similarly, LN Ltd may argue that the demand for increased haulage rates was made under duress. The court would need to consider whether the original contract terms were clear and whether the demand constituted a legitimate variation or an unlawful threat.
- **Gloop plc's Testing Costs:** The demand for additional testing costs by Gloop plc would need to be examined in light of the original contract terms. If the contract did not provide for such costs, LN Ltd could argue that this constitutes an unlawful variation. However, the court would likely uphold the original terms unless the demand was "obviously wrong" or of general importance.

In conclusion, LN Ltd should carefully review the original contract terms and consider whether the demands made by the Union, DSTR Ltd, and Gloop plc were justified or constituted unlawful variations. The high threshold for challenging these demands suggests that LN Ltd may face difficulties in recovering the payments unless clear evidence of economic duress or unlawful variation can be established.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCCT 4/2018) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Contractual Interpretation**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In HCCT 4/2018, the court examined the interpretation of specific contractual clauses (e.g., Para 1(f) regarding idling deductions). In our current case, we need to interpret the contractual terms between LN Ltd and Gloop plc regarding the additional testing costs.

- **Legal Concept 2: Condition Precedent**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** In HCCT 4/2018, the court considered whether the conditions precedent (e.g., notice requirements under Clause 21) were met. In our current case, we need to determine whether the demand for additional testing costs by Gloop plc constitutes a variation of the contract and whether any conditions precedent for such a variation were met.

- **Legal Concept 3: Economic Duress**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In HCCT 4/2018, the court did not directly address economic duress, but the principles of fairness and the balance of power in contractual relationships were implicit in the court's reasoning. In our current case, LN Ltd's payments to the Union and DSTR Ltd may involve elements of economic duress, where LN Ltd felt compelled to pay under threat of significant business disruption.

- **Legal Concept 4: Finality and Arbitration**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** In HCCT 4/2018, the court emphasized the finality of arbitration decisions and the limited grounds for court intervention. In our current case, while not directly involving arbitration, the principle of respecting agreed contractual terms and the high threshold for challenging them is relevant.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCCT 4/2018. This decision would be justified because, as in HCCT 4/2018, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Respect for Contractual Terms:** Upholding the original contractual terms unless they are "obviously wrong" or of general importance promotes certainty and stability in commercial relationships. This is crucial for businesses like LN Ltd, which rely on predictable and enforceable agreements to operate efficiently.

2. **Finality in Dispute Resolution:** Just as the court in HCCT 4/2018 emphasized the importance of finality in arbitration, respecting the finality of agreed contractual terms in our current case would reduce unnecessary litigation and encourage parties to resolve disputes through negotiation and arbitration.

3. **Economic Duress Considerations:** Addressing economic duress claims with a high threshold ensures that only genuine cases of coercion are remedied, preventing frivolous claims and maintaining the balance of power in commercial relationships.

4. **General Importance in Industry:** The court's decision in HCCT 4/2018 acknowledged the broader implications for the construction industry. Similarly, our current case involves practices (e.g., notification of claim provisions) that are prevalent in the logistics and manufacturing industries. A consistent approach would provide clarity and guidance for these sectors.

In conclusion, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCCT 4/2018, it would have the positive effects of promoting certainty, finality, fairness, and industry-wide clarity in contractual relationships.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCCT 4/2018, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of a detailed arbitration process and the high threshold for court intervention in arbitration awards. This arbitration process was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as finality and respect for the parties' choice of dispute resolution, outweighed any potential drawbacks, such as the possibility of an incorrect arbitration award. However, in our current case, this crucial arbitration process is notably absent as the disputes involving LN Ltd, the Union, DSTR Ltd, and Gloop plc do not involve arbitration but rather direct contractual relationships and potential claims of economic duress and unlawful variation.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, economic duress, that was not present in HCCT 4/2018. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of contractual interpretation and condition precedent. Because of economic duress, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as unjust enrichment and unfair business practices, than positive ones, unlike in HCCT 4/2018. The presence of economic duress in our case means that LN Ltd may have been compelled to make payments under threat, which conflicts with the principle of voluntary and fair contractual agreements. Therefore, the court should consider the impact of economic duress and potentially allow LN Ltd to recover the payments made to the Union and DSTR Ltd, and challenge the additional testing costs demanded by Gloop plc.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCCT 4/2018 should be stated as: "When both the shared fact pattern of contractual interpretation and condition precedent (i*) and the presence of economic duress (m) are present, the court should decide in favor of allowing the aggrieved party to recover payments made under duress and challenge additional costs imposed unlawfully (o)." Omitting the factor of economic duress (m) from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of unjust enrichment and unfair business practices (q). Indeed, the opinion in HCCT 4/2018 implicitly emphasizes the importance of fairness and balance in contractual relationships, which would be undermined if economic duress were not considered.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCCT 4/2018 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of undermining the finality and certainty of arbitration awards and contractual agreements (u). However, in our current case, there's no risk of undermining arbitration awards because the disputes do not involve arbitration but rather direct contractual relationships and potential claims of economic duress and unlawful variation. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule strictly without considering economic duress here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—promoting finality and certainty in arbitration—is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should focus on preventing unjust enrichment and ensuring fairness in contractual dealings, which are more pertinent to the current case.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the arbitration process (factor m), which was present in the precedent case HCCT 4/2018, requiring this factor for all similar cases of contractual interpretation and condition precedent (fact pattern i*) would lead to the undesirable consequence of unjust enrichment and unfair business practices. Conversely, not requiring the arbitration process would allow for the desirable outcome of addressing economic duress and ensuring fairness in contractual dealings, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, such as the prevention of coercion and the enforcement of fair agreements.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the arbitration process (factor m), which was present in HCCT 4/2018, we have the additional factor of economic duress (factor n). This economic duress, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of contractual interpretation and condition precedent (fact pattern i*), serves a similar function to the arbitration process in the precedent case. Given the presence of economic duress, we submit that the reasoning in HCCT 4/2018 still applies, as the positive effects on fairness and the prevention of coercion in contractual relationships would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCCT 4/2018, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in the areas of contractual interpretation and condition precedent. However, it also differs significantly in the absence of an arbitration process and the presence of economic duress.

The proposed legal rule from HCCT 4/2018 emphasizes the importance of finality in arbitration and the high threshold for court intervention, which promotes certainty and stability in commercial relationships. This rule finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered, especially in the context of economic duress and direct contractual relationships.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that respecting contractual terms and finality promotes business certainty (as argued in the initial analogy) and the counterargument that economic duress should be considered to prevent unjust enrichment and ensure fairness (as argued in the rebuttal).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, prevention of coercion, and the enforcement of fair agreements, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the presence of economic duress in the current case warrants a different approach from the precedent in HCCT 4/2018. The court should allow LN Ltd to recover the payments made to the Union and DSTR Ltd under economic duress and challenge the additional testing costs demanded by Gloop plc, as these demands likely constitute unlawful variations and coercive practices.

This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by addressing the unique circumstances of economic duress and ensuring that contractual relationships remain fair and voluntary.


# Contract Law: Whether the threat by Gloop plc to cease offering credit constitutes economic duress

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Unconscionable Contracts Ordinance Cap. 458 Section 5 Subsection 1 and Section 6 Subsections 1 and 2

### Major Premise:

1. Unconscionable Contracts Ordinance Cap. 458 Section 5 Subsection 1

   Conditions:
   - A contract for the sale of goods or supply of services
   - One of the parties deals as a consumer
   - The court finds the contract or any part of the contract to have been unconscionable in the circumstances relating to the contract at the time it was made

   Consequences:
   - The court may refuse to enforce the contract
   - Enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable part
   - Limit the application of, or revise or alter, any unconscionable part so as to avoid any unconscionable result

   Exceptions:
   - None

2. Unconscionable Contracts Ordinance Cap. 458 Section 6 Subsections 1 and 2

   Conditions:
   - Determining whether a contract or part of a contract was unconscionable in the circumstances relating to the contract at the time it was made

   Consequences:
   - The court may have regard to:
     * The relative strengths of the bargaining positions of the consumer and the other party
     * Whether, as a result of conduct engaged in by the other party, the consumer was required to comply with conditions that were not reasonably necessary for the protection of the legitimate interests of the other party
     * Whether the consumer was able to understand any documents relating to the supply or possible supply of the goods or services
     * Whether any undue influence or pressure was exerted on, or any unfair tactics were used against, the consumer or a person acting on behalf of the consumer by the other party or a person acting on behalf of the other party in relation to the supply or possible supply of the goods or services
     * The amount for which, and the circumstances under which, the consumer could have acquired identical or equivalent goods or services from a person other than the other party

   Exceptions:
   - The court shall not have regard to any unconscionability arising from circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable at the time the contract was made

### Minor Premise:

1. Unconscionable Contracts Ordinance Cap. 458 Section 5 Subsection 1:
- LN Ltd entered into contracts for the supply of services with Baltimore & McNulty Ltd and DSTR Ltd.
- LN Ltd deals as a consumer in these contracts.
- The court may find the contracts or parts of the contracts unconscionable due to the circumstances at the time they were made, such as the demands for additional payments under duress.

2. Unconscionable Contracts Ordinance Cap. 458 Section 6 Subsections 1 and 2:
- The court will consider the relative strengths of the bargaining positions of LN Ltd and the other parties.
- The court will consider whether LN Ltd was required to comply with conditions not reasonably necessary for the protection of the legitimate interests of Baltimore & McNulty Ltd and DSTR Ltd.
- The court will consider whether LN Ltd was able to understand the documents relating to the supply of services.
- The court will consider whether undue influence or pressure was exerted on LN Ltd by Baltimore & McNulty Ltd and DSTR Ltd.
- The court will consider the amount for which, and the circumstances under which, LN Ltd could have acquired equivalent services from other parties.
- The court will not consider any unconscionability arising from circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable at the time the contracts were made.

### Conclusion:

Unconscionable Contracts Ordinance Cap. 458 Section 5 Subsection 1 and Section 6 Subsections 1 and 2 apply. The court may find the contracts or parts of the contracts with Baltimore & McNulty Ltd and DSTR Ltd unconscionable due to the circumstances at the time they were made, such as the demands for additional payments under duress. Therefore, the court may refuse to enforce the unconscionable parts of the contracts, enforce the remainder of the contracts without the unconscionable parts, or limit the application of, or revise or alter, any unconscionable parts to avoid any unconscionable result. LN Ltd may recover the monies paid to the Union and DSTR Ltd. As for Gloop plc, the threat to cease offering credit may constitute economic duress, and LN Ltd may not be bound to pay for the testing if the court finds the demand unconscionable.

### Relevant law:

Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum, Magic Score Limited v The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, CACV 10/2012 Mir, Abdul Rehman v Mir, Heena

### Major Premise:

1. Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum

   Conditions:
   - A contracting party is induced to act in a particular way by pressure which the law does not regard as legitimate
   - The effect of which pressure is to deprive the party of any practical choice in the matter
   - The victim's intentional submission arises from the realisation that there is no practical choice open to him

   Consequences:
   - The contract may be voidable due to duress

   Exceptions:
   - The victim had an alternative course open to him such as an adequate legal remedy
   - The victim was independently advised
   - After entering the contract, the victim took steps to avoid it

2. Magic Score Limited v The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited

   Conditions:
   - The pressure exercised upon the weaker party is illegitimate, which may consist of unlawful threats or unconscionable conduct
   - The illegitimate pressure constitutes a significant cause for the weaker party to have entered into the agreement

   Consequences:
   - The weaker party may avoid the contract entered into under duress

   Exceptions:
   - The pressure does not amount to unconscionable or unlawful conduct
   - The pressure is not a significant cause for entering into the agreement

3. CACV 10/2012 Mir, Abdul Rehman v Mir, Heena

   Conditions:
   - There is a threat to the person made for the purpose of inducing the contract
   - The threat was a reason for the victim entering the contract

   Consequences:
   - The contract may be avoided for duress

   Exceptions:
   - The party who made the threat can show that it had not influenced the victim in any way

### Minor Premise:

1. Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum:
   - LN Ltd was induced to act by the Union's pressure, which the law does not regard as legitimate (wrongful interference with goods).
   - The effect of the Union's pressure was to deprive LN Ltd of any practical choice in the matter (paying the equivalent of an administrator’s monthly salary to avoid delays).
   - LN Ltd's intentional submission arose from the realisation that there was no practical choice open to them until the strike was over.
   - LN Ltd did not have an alternative course open to them, such as an adequate legal remedy, and there is no indication they were independently advised or took steps to avoid the contract after entering it.

2. Magic Score Limited v The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited:
   - The pressure exercised by DSTR Ltd was illegitimate (demanding an increase in haulage rates under threat of ceasing delivery).
   - The illegitimate pressure was a significant cause for LN Ltd to have entered into the agreement (reluctantly agreeing and paying £50,000 before finding an alternative carrier).
   - The pressure amounted to unconscionable conduct, and it was a significant cause for LN Ltd entering into the agreement.

3. CACV 10/2012 Mir, Abdul Rehman v Mir, Heena:
   - There was no direct threat to the person made for the purpose of inducing the contract in the case of Gloop plc.
   - Therefore, this case does not apply to the scenario involving Gloop plc.

### Conclusion:

1. The monies paid to the Union can be recovered as the contract may be voidable due to duress under Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum.

2. The monies paid to DSTR Ltd can be recovered as the contract may be avoided for duress under Magic Score Limited v The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited.

3. LN Ltd is not bound to pay Gloop plc for testing as the threat to cease offering credit does not constitute economic duress under the relevant case law.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA001652/1996)
In the case of HCA001652/1996 BETWEEN SEIKOSHA CO., LTD. SEIKO PRECISION INC. 1st Plaintiff 2nd Plaintiff AND IDS (CHINA) LTD. DAVID HAUSJAH 1st Defendant 2nd Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the defendants had a triable issue regarding the allegations of illegality, defective goods, and economic duress. The court granted leave to the 1st defendant to defend the case, conditional on the payment into court of the full sum claimed, due to the belief that the defences advanced might be sham defences.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA001652/1996 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Economic Duress**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA001652/1996, the 1st defendant alleged that they were coerced into an agreement due to the threat of non-delivery of spare parts, which was essential for their business operations.
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In the current case, LN Ltd was coerced into paying additional sums to DSTR Ltd under the threat of ceasing delivery of nitrocellulose, which is essential for their manufacturing process.

- **Illegality**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA001652/1996, the defendants alleged that the agreement involved an unlawful device to avoid import taxes, which could render the contract unenforceable.
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In the current case, the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union's demand for payments to allow goods to pass through customs borders constitutes a wrongful interference with goods and is unlawful.

- **Defective Goods**:
  - **Fact Pattern 5**: In HCA001652/1996, the defendants claimed that the goods supplied were defective and caused significant loss and damage.
  - **Fact Pattern 6**: Although not directly applicable to the current case, the concept of defective goods can be analogized to the increased costs and operational disruptions faced by LN Ltd due to the actions of DSTR Ltd and the Union.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA001652/1996)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of economic duress, illegality, and defective goods (i*), the court should decide that there is a triable issue and allow the defendant to defend the case (outcome o). This rule was justified in HCA001652/1996 because the positive effects (E+) of allowing a fair trial and investigation into the allegations of duress, illegality, and defective goods outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially delaying the resolution of the case.

Applying this rule to the current case:

- **Economic Duress**: LN Ltd can argue that the threat by DSTR Ltd to cease delivery of nitrocellulose constitutes economic duress, similar to the threat of non-delivery of spare parts in HCA001652/1996. This duress forced LN Ltd to pay an additional £50,000, which they should be able to recover.

- **Illegality**: The payments made to the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union under duress and wrongful interference with goods are unlawful. LN Ltd should be able to recover the £30,000 paid to the Union.

- **Defective Goods**: Although not directly applicable, the increased costs and operational disruptions faced by LN Ltd due to the actions of DSTR Ltd and the Union can be analogized to the concept of defective goods causing loss and damage.

Therefore, LN Ltd should be able to recover the monies paid to the Union and DSTR Ltd and should not be bound to pay Gloop plc for the testing costs under the threat of ceasing to offer credit, as this also constitutes economic duress.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA001652/1996) are present:

- **Economic Duress**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA001652/1996, the 1st defendant alleged that they were coerced into an agreement due to the threat of non-delivery of spare parts, which was essential for their business operations.
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In the current case, LN Ltd was coerced into paying additional sums to DSTR Ltd under the threat of ceasing delivery of nitrocellulose, which is essential for their manufacturing process.

- **Illegality**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA001652/1996, the defendants alleged that the agreement involved an unlawful device to avoid import taxes, which could render the contract unenforceable.
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In the current case, the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union's demand for payments to allow goods to pass through customs borders constitutes a wrongful interference with goods and is unlawful.

- **Defective Goods**:
  - **Fact Pattern 5**: In HCA001652/1996, the defendants claimed that the goods supplied were defective and caused significant loss and damage.
  - **Fact Pattern 6**: Although not directly applicable to the current case, the concept of defective goods can be analogized to the increased costs and operational disruptions faced by LN Ltd due to the actions of DSTR Ltd and the Union.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCA001652/1996. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA001652/1996, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Fair Trial and Investigation**: Allowing LN Ltd to recover the monies paid under duress and wrongful interference ensures that the allegations of economic duress and illegality are properly investigated and adjudicated. This upholds the principle of justice and fairness in contractual dealings.

2. **Deterrence of Unlawful Conduct**: By permitting LN Ltd to recover the payments made to the Union and DSTR Ltd, the court would send a strong message that unlawful interference and economic duress will not be tolerated. This would deter similar conduct by other parties in the future, promoting lawful and ethical business practices.

3. **Protection of Business Interests**: Ensuring that LN Ltd is not bound to pay Gloop plc for testing costs under the threat of ceasing to offer credit protects businesses from being coerced into unfavorable agreements. This fosters a more stable and predictable business environment.

4. **Consistency in Legal Principles**: Applying the same legal principles as in HCA001652/1996 maintains consistency in the application of the law, which is crucial for the predictability and reliability of legal outcomes. This consistency reinforces the rule of law and the integrity of the legal system.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA001652/1996, it would have the positive effects of ensuring a fair trial, deterring unlawful conduct, protecting business interests, and maintaining consistency in legal principles.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA001652/1996, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of a detailed and specific allegation of illegality. The defendants in HCA001652/1996 provided an express assertion that Chinese law was breached and described an unlawful device to avoid import taxes. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as a fair trial and investigation into the allegations of illegality, outweighed any potential drawbacks, such as delaying the resolution of the case. The court found that the allegation of illegality was not inherently incredible and warranted a trial to investigate the issue further.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of a detailed and specific allegation of illegality is notably absent. While LN Ltd is aware that the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union's demand for payments is a wrongful interference with goods and unlawful, there is no detailed description or specific assertion of the exact laws being breached or the method adopted in breaching them. This lack of specificity weakens the argument for a triable issue based on illegality, as it does not provide a clear basis for the court to investigate the matter further.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in HCA001652/1996: the highly inflammable nature of the nitrocellulose used by LN Ltd. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of economic duress. The threat by DSTR Ltd to cease delivery of nitrocellulose, a hazardous and essential material for LN Ltd's manufacturing process, introduces a heightened level of urgency and potential danger that was not present in the precedent case.

Due to the inflammable nature of nitrocellulose, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as increased safety risks and potential disruptions to LN Ltd's operations, than positive ones. Unlike in HCA001652/1996, where the threat involved spare parts, the threat in our current case involves a critical and hazardous material, which significantly raises the stakes and the potential impact on LN Ltd's business. This distinction suggests that the court should consider the unique circumstances and heightened risks in our current case when determining whether the threat constitutes economic duress and whether the payments made to DSTR Ltd can be recovered.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from HCA001652/1996 should be stated as: "When both the fact pattern of economic duress, illegality, and defective goods (i*) and a detailed and specific allegation of illegality (m) are present, the court should decide that there is a triable issue and allow the defendant to defend the case (outcome o)." Omitting the detailed and specific allegation of illegality (m) from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence (q) of allowing vague and unsubstantiated claims of illegality to proceed to trial, thereby wasting judicial resources and potentially encouraging frivolous defences. Indeed, the opinion in HCA001652/1996 explicitly states that the detailed and specific allegation of illegality was crucial to their decision, as it provided a clear basis for the court to investigate the matter further.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in HCA001652/1996 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence (u) of allowing vague and unsubstantiated claims to proceed to trial, which would waste judicial resources and potentially encourage frivolous defences. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because the threat by DSTR Ltd to cease delivery of nitrocellulose, a highly inflammable and essential material, introduces a heightened level of urgency and potential danger that was not present in the precedent case. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The unique circumstances and heightened risks in our current case warrant a different approach, recognizing the significant impact on LN Ltd's business and safety.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the detailed and specific allegation of illegality (factor m), which was present in the precedent case HCA001652/1996, requiring this factor for all similar cases of economic duress, illegality, and defective goods (fact pattern i*) would lead to the undesirable consequence of allowing parties to exploit vague threats and coercive tactics without recourse. Conversely, not requiring the detailed and specific allegation of illegality (m) would allow for a more flexible and just approach, ensuring that businesses like LN Ltd can seek redress for economic duress and wrongful interference even when the specifics of the illegality are not fully detailed. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which aim to protect parties from unfair and coercive practices and ensure that agreements are entered into freely and voluntarily.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the detailed and specific allegation of illegality (factor m), which was present in HCA001652/1996, we have the additional factor of the highly inflammable nature of nitrocellulose (factor n). This factor n, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of economic duress, illegality, and defective goods (fact pattern i*), serves a similar function to m in the precedent case by highlighting the heightened urgency and potential danger involved. Given the presence of n, we submit that the reasoning in HCA001652/1996 still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as ensuring fair business practices, protecting parties from coercion, and maintaining safety standards would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA001652/1996, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in the fact patterns of economic duress, illegality, and defective goods. However, it also differs in significant ways, notably the absence of a detailed and specific allegation of illegality and the presence of the highly inflammable nature of nitrocellulose.

The proposed legal rule from HCA001652/1996, which allows for a triable issue when economic duress, illegality, and defective goods are present, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the unique circumstances of the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides. A strong point from the initial analogy is that economic duress and wrongful interference with goods should be grounds for recovery of payments made under coercion. Conversely, a strong point from the rebuttal is that the absence of a detailed and specific allegation of illegality weakens the argument for a triable issue based on illegality.

Considering the underlying legal principles of ensuring fair business practices, protecting parties from coercion, and maintaining safety standards, we conclude that LN Ltd should be able to recover the monies paid to the Union and DSTR Ltd. The heightened urgency and potential danger due to the inflammable nature of nitrocellulose justify treating the threat by DSTR Ltd as economic duress. Additionally, the wrongful interference by the Union constitutes an unlawful act, warranting recovery of the payments made.

However, LN Ltd should not be bound to pay Gloop plc for the testing costs under the threat of ceasing to offer credit, as this also constitutes economic duress. The absence of a detailed and specific allegation of illegality does not undermine the overall argument for economic duress and wrongful interference in this case.

Therefore, the decision reached aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency. The key factors influencing this outcome include the presence of economic duress, the unlawful nature of the Union's actions, and the heightened risks associated with the inflammable nature of nitrocellulose.


# Contract Law: Whether LN Ltd can claim that the contract with Gloop plc has been frustrated due to the new regulatory requirements

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsections 2, 3, and 6

### Major Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - A contract governed by law applicable to the Colony has become impossible of performance or been otherwise frustrated.
   - The parties thereto have for that reason been discharged from the further performance of the contract.

   Consequences:
   - All sums paid or payable to any party in pursuance of the contract before the time when the parties were so discharged shall, in the case of sums so paid, be recoverable from him as money received by him for the use of the party by whom the sums were paid.
   - In the case of sums so payable, cease to be so payable.

   Exceptions:
   - If the party to whom the sums were so paid or payable incurred expenses before the time of discharge in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, the court may, if it considers it just to do so having regard to all the circumstances of the case, allow him to retain or, as the case may be, recover the whole or any part of the sums so paid or payable, not being an amount in excess of the expenses so incurred.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3

   Conditions:
   - Any party to the contract has, by reason of anything done by any other party thereto in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, obtained a valuable benefit (other than a payment of money to which subsection (2) applies) before the time of discharge.

   Consequences:
   - There shall be recoverable from him by the said other party such sum (if any), not exceeding the value of the said benefit to the party obtaining it, as the court considers just, having regard to all the circumstances of the case.

   Exceptions:
   - The amount of any expenses incurred before the time of discharge by the benefited party in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, including any sums paid or payable by him to any other party in pursuance of the contract and retained or recoverable by that party under subsection (2).
   - The effect, in relation to the said benefit, of the circumstances giving rise to the frustration of the contract.

3. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 6

   Conditions:
   - Any person has assumed obligations under the contract in consideration of the conferring of a benefit by any other party to the contract upon any other person, whether a party to the contract or not.

   Consequences:
   - The court may, if in all the circumstances of the case it considers it just to do so, treat for the purposes of subsection (3) any benefit so conferred as a benefit obtained by the person who has assumed the obligations as aforesaid.

   Exceptions:
   - None.

### Minor Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2:
- LN Ltd's contract with Baltimore & McNulty Ltd has become impossible of performance due to the unlawful interference by the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union.
- LN Ltd has been discharged from further performance of the contract with Baltimore & McNulty Ltd.
- LN Ltd has paid £30,000 to the Union due to the unlawful interference.
- The sums paid to the Union were not for the purpose of the performance of the contract but were extorted unlawfully.
- Therefore, the sums paid to the Union are recoverable from the Union as money received by them for the use of LN Ltd.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3:
- LN Ltd has paid £50,000 to DSTR Ltd under duress to continue the delivery of nitrocellulose.
- DSTR Ltd obtained a valuable benefit (the £50,000) before the time of discharge.
- The court may consider it just to allow LN Ltd to recover the £50,000 from DSTR Ltd, having regard to the circumstances of the case, including the duress and the increased insurance costs.

3. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 6:
- LN Ltd has assumed obligations under the contract with Gloop plc in consideration of the conferring of a benefit (the pigment for the nail polish).
- The new regulatory requirements by the US Food and Drugs Administration do not frustrate the contract but impose additional costs.
- The court may consider it just to treat the benefit conferred by Gloop plc as a benefit obtained by LN Ltd, and thus LN Ltd may be required to pay the additional £5,000 per annum for testing.

### Conclusion:

1. The £30,000 paid to the Union is recoverable by LN Ltd as money received by the Union for the use of LN Ltd.
2. The £50,000 paid to DSTR Ltd is recoverable by LN Ltd, subject to the court's consideration of the circumstances, including the duress and increased insurance costs.
3. LN Ltd is bound to pay Gloop plc the additional £5,000 per annum for testing, as the court may consider it just to treat the benefit conferred by Gloop plc as a benefit obtained by LN Ltd.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR")

In the case of WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" [2022] HKCFI 2036; HCA 954/2020 (precedent p), the defendants argued that the tenancy agreements were frustrated due to the extraordinary and unprecedented events of social unrest and the COVID-19 pandemic, which drastically affected their business. The court ruled that the doctrine of frustration did not apply because the fundamental nature of the contractual obligations had not been radically altered by these events. The court emphasized that mere hardship, inconvenience, or material loss was insufficient to invoke the doctrine of frustration.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Doctrine of Frustration**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the parties argued that unforeseen and extraordinary events (social unrest and pandemic in precedent p; regulatory changes and union interference in current case c) had drastically affected their ability to perform their contractual obligations.

- **Legal Concept 2: Allocation of Risk**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In both cases, the court examined whether the risk of the unforeseen events was implicitly or explicitly allocated to one of the parties in the contract.

- **Legal Concept 3: Fundamental Change in Obligations**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: Both cases required the court to determine whether the unforeseen events had fundamentally changed the nature of the contractual obligations, making them radically different from what was originally agreed upon.

- **Legal Concept 4: Hardship and Onerousness**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: Both cases involved significant hardship and increased costs for one of the parties due to the unforeseen events, but the court had to decide whether this hardship was sufficient to invoke the doctrine of frustration.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR")

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of unforeseen and extraordinary events causing significant hardship and increased costs (fact pattern i*), the court should decide that the doctrine of frustration does not apply unless the fundamental nature of the contractual obligations has been radically altered. This rule was justified in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" because the positive effects (E+) of maintaining contractual certainty and upholding the agreed allocation of risk outweighed the negative effects (E-) of the hardship experienced by the defendants.

Applying this rule to the current case:

- **Union Payments**: The payments made to the Union (£30,000) were due to unlawful interference, but this does not fundamentally alter the nature of the contract with Baltimore & McNulty Ltd. LN Ltd may have a separate claim for wrongful interference but cannot claim frustration of the contract.

- **DSTR Ltd Payments**: The increased haulage rates (£50,000) were agreed upon under duress, but the fundamental nature of the delivery contract remains unchanged. LN Ltd may have a claim for economic duress but not frustration.

- **Gloop plc Testing Costs**: The new regulatory requirements do not fundamentally change the nature of the contract with Gloop plc. LN Ltd is not bound to pay for the testing costs unless explicitly agreed upon in the contract.

Therefore, LN Ltd cannot claim that the contracts with Baltimore & McNulty Ltd, DSTR Ltd, or Gloop plc have been frustrated due to the new regulatory requirements or other unforeseen events.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR") are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Doctrine of Frustration**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the parties argued that unforeseen and extraordinary events (social unrest and pandemic in the precedent; regulatory changes and union interference in the current case) had drastically affected their ability to perform their contractual obligations.

- **Legal Concept 2: Allocation of Risk**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In both cases, the court examined whether the risk of the unforeseen events was implicitly or explicitly allocated to one of the parties in the contract.

- **Legal Concept 3: Fundamental Change in Obligations**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: Both cases required the court to determine whether the unforeseen events had fundamentally changed the nature of the contractual obligations, making them radically different from what was originally agreed upon.

- **Legal Concept 4: Hardship and Onerousness**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: Both cases involved significant hardship and increased costs for one of the parties due to the unforeseen events, but the court had to decide whether this hardship was sufficient to invoke the doctrine of frustration.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR". This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Maintaining Contractual Certainty**: Upholding the contracts despite the unforeseen events ensures that parties can rely on the terms they have agreed upon, promoting stability and predictability in commercial transactions.

2. **Upholding Agreed Allocation of Risk**: By not allowing the doctrine of frustration to be invoked lightly, the court respects the implicit and explicit risk allocations agreed upon by the parties. This encourages parties to carefully consider and negotiate risk allocation in their contracts.

3. **Preventing Abuse of the Doctrine of Frustration**: Limiting the application of the doctrine to cases where the fundamental nature of the contractual obligations has been radically altered prevents parties from using it as an easy escape from their contractual commitments due to mere hardship or increased costs.

4. **Encouraging Business Resilience**: By requiring parties to bear the risks they have agreed to, the court encourages businesses to develop strategies to manage and mitigate risks, fostering resilience and adaptability in the face of unforeseen events.

Therefore, LN Ltd cannot claim that the contracts with Baltimore & McNulty Ltd, DSTR Ltd, or Gloop plc have been frustrated due to the new regulatory requirements or other unforeseen events. The payments made to the Union and DSTR Ltd were due to unlawful interference and economic duress, respectively, but these do not fundamentally alter the nature of the contracts. LN Ltd may have separate claims for wrongful interference and economic duress but cannot claim frustration of the contracts. Similarly, LN Ltd is not bound to pay for the testing costs demanded by Gloop plc unless explicitly agreed upon in the contract.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case

In the precedent case **WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR"**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the primary obligations of the parties under the tenancy agreements remained unaltered despite the unforeseen events. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—maintaining contractual certainty and upholding the agreed allocation of risk—outweighed any potential drawbacks, such as the hardship experienced by the defendants. The court emphasized that the premises were still available for the defendants to operate their businesses, and the fundamental nature of the contractual obligations had not been radically altered.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent. The contracts with Baltimore & McNulty Ltd, DSTR Ltd, and Gloop plc involve different types of obligations and risks compared to a tenancy agreement. Specifically:

- **Baltimore & McNulty Ltd**: The interference by the Union significantly disrupts the logistics and delivery system, which is central to the contract's purpose.
- **DSTR Ltd**: The demand for increased haulage rates under duress fundamentally alters the cost structure of the contract, which was initially agreed upon without a price variation clause.
- **Gloop plc**: The new regulatory requirements for pigment testing introduce additional compliance costs that were not contemplated at the time of contract formation.

These differences mean that the fundamental nature of the contractual obligations in the current case may indeed be radically altered by the unforeseen events, unlike in the precedent case.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case

Our current case involves an important factor—**the introduction of new regulatory requirements and unlawful interference by a third party**—that was not present in **WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR"**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces external legal and operational constraints that were not contemplated by the parties at the time of contract formation.

Due to these new regulatory requirements and third-party interference, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as:

- **Increased Operational Costs**: The new regulatory requirements and unlawful interference lead to significant additional costs that were not accounted for in the original contracts.
- **Disruption of Business Operations**: The interference by the Union and the increased insurance costs for hazardous materials disrupt the core business operations of LN Ltd, making it difficult to fulfill contractual obligations.
- **Economic Duress**: The demand for increased haulage rates under duress by DSTR Ltd introduces an element of economic duress, which was not a factor in the precedent case.

Unlike in **WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR"**, where the fundamental nature of the contractual obligations remained unchanged, the presence of these new factors in our current case significantly alters the balance of positive and negative effects. Therefore, the doctrine of frustration may be more applicable in the current case to address the radically altered circumstances and to prevent unjust outcomes.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from **WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR"** should be stated as: "When both [i*] (unforeseen and extraordinary events causing significant hardship and increased costs) and [m] (the fundamental nature of the contractual obligations remains unchanged) are present, the court should decide [o] (the doctrine of frustration does not apply)." Omitting [m] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q] (parties could easily escape their contractual obligations due to mere hardship or increased costs, undermining contractual certainty and stability).

Indeed, the opinion in **WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR"** explicitly states that [m] was crucial to their decision. The court emphasized that the primary obligations of the parties under the tenancy agreements remained unaltered despite the unforeseen events, which was a key factor in their decision to not apply the doctrine of frustration.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in **WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR"** was clearly designed to prevent [undesirable consequence u] (parties using the doctrine of frustration as an easy escape from their contractual commitments due to mere hardship or increased costs). However, in our current case, there's no risk of [u] occurring because the unforeseen events (new regulatory requirements and unlawful interference by a third party) have introduced external legal and operational constraints that were not contemplated by the parties at the time of contract formation. These constraints fundamentally alter the nature of the contractual obligations.

Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The contracts with Baltimore & McNulty Ltd, DSTR Ltd, and Gloop plc involve different types of obligations and risks compared to a tenancy agreement, and the unforeseen events in our case have significantly altered the balance of positive and negative effects. Thus, the doctrine of frustration may be more applicable in the current case to address the radically altered circumstances and to prevent unjust outcomes.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction

While it's true that our case lacks the factor of the fundamental nature of the contractual obligations remaining unchanged (factor m), which was present in the precedent case **WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR"**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of unforeseen and extraordinary events causing significant hardship and increased costs (fact pattern i*) would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would mean that parties could never invoke the doctrine of frustration unless the fundamental nature of the obligations remained unchanged, even in cases where external legal and operational constraints significantly alter the performance of the contract. Conversely, not requiring factor m would allow for a more flexible and just application of the doctrine of frustration, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area. The law of frustration is designed to address situations where unforeseen events make the performance of the contract radically different from what was originally agreed upon, and not requiring factor m would ensure that parties are not unfairly bound to contracts that have become fundamentally altered due to such events.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution

Although our case lacks the factor of the fundamental nature of the contractual obligations remaining unchanged (factor m), which was present in **WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR"**, we have the additional factor of external legal and operational constraints introduced by new regulatory requirements and unlawful interference by a third party (factor n). This factor n, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of unforeseen and extraordinary events causing significant hardship and increased costs (fact pattern i*), serves a similar function to factor m in the precedent case. Given the presence of factor n, we submit that the reasoning in **WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR"** still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as fairness, justice, and the proper allocation of risk would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. The introduction of new regulatory requirements and unlawful interference fundamentally alters the performance of the contracts, justifying the application of the doctrine of frustration in our current case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR"**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of unforeseen and extraordinary events causing significant hardship and increased costs. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the introduction of new regulatory requirements and unlawful interference by a third party, which were not present in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case—that the doctrine of frustration does not apply unless the fundamental nature of the contractual obligations has been radically altered—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the unique factors present in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the fundamental nature of the contractual obligations in the precedent case remained unchanged, which justified not applying the doctrine of frustration. On the other hand, the current case involves external legal and operational constraints that significantly alter the performance of the contracts, suggesting that the doctrine of frustration may be more applicable.

Considering the underlying legal principles of maintaining contractual certainty, upholding agreed risk allocations, and preventing the abuse of the doctrine of frustration, we conclude that the doctrine of frustration should not be lightly invoked. However, the unique factors in the current case—specifically the new regulatory requirements and unlawful interference—introduce constraints that were not contemplated by the parties at the time of contract formation and fundamentally alter the performance of the contracts.

Therefore, we conclude that:

1. **Union Payments**: The payments made to the Union (£30,000) were due to unlawful interference, but this does not fundamentally alter the nature of the contract with Baltimore & McNulty Ltd. LN Ltd may have a separate claim for wrongful interference but cannot claim frustration of the contract.

2. **DSTR Ltd Payments**: The increased haulage rates (£50,000) were agreed upon under duress, but the fundamental nature of the delivery contract remains unchanged. LN Ltd may have a claim for economic duress but not frustration.

3. **Gloop plc Testing Costs**: The new regulatory requirements do not fundamentally change the nature of the contract with Gloop plc. LN Ltd is not bound to pay for the testing costs unless explicitly agreed upon in the contract.

In conclusion, LN Ltd cannot claim that the contracts with Baltimore & McNulty Ltd, DSTR Ltd, or Gloop plc have been frustrated due to the new regulatory requirements or other unforeseen events. The payments made to the Union and DSTR Ltd were due to unlawful interference and economic duress, respectively, but these do not fundamentally alter the nature of the contracts. LN Ltd may have separate claims for wrongful interference and economic duress but cannot claim frustration of the contracts. Similarly, LN Ltd is not bound to pay for the testing costs demanded by Gloop plc unless explicitly agreed upon in the contract. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency.


# Contract Law: Whether LN Ltd can seek a remedy for breach of contract if Gloop plc ceases to offer credit without agreement on the additional testing costs

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsections 3, 4, and 5

### Major Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3

   Conditions:

   Consequences:
   - There shall be recoverable from him by the said other party such sum (if any), not exceeding the value of the said benefit to the party obtaining it, as the court considers just, having regard to all the circumstances of the case.

   Exceptions:
   - None

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 4

   Conditions:
   - In estimating the amount of any expenses incurred by any party to the contract.

   Consequences:
   - The court may include such sum as appears to be reasonable in respect of overhead expenses and in respect of any work or services performed personally by the said party.

   Exceptions:
   - None

3. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 5

   Conditions:
   - Considering whether any sum ought to be recovered or retained under subsections (1), (2), (3), and (4) by any party to the contract.

   Exceptions:
   - Unless there was an obligation to insure imposed by an express term of the frustrated contract or by or under any enactment.

### Minor Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3:
   - LN Ltd has paid £30,000 to the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union due to their wrongful interference with goods.
   - This payment was made for the purpose of the performance of the contract with Baltimore & McNulty Ltd.
   - LN Ltd has obtained a valuable benefit (the continuation of the delivery system) before the time of discharge.
   - Therefore, LN Ltd may recover such sum as the court considers just, having regard to all the circumstances of the case.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 4:
   - LN Ltd incurred £50,000 in additional expenses due to DSTR Ltd's demand for increased haulage rates.
   - The court may include such sum as appears to be reasonable in respect of overhead expenses and in respect of any work or services performed personally by LN Ltd.
   - Therefore, LN Ltd may recover the additional expenses incurred.

3. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 5:
   - Considering whether any sum ought to be recovered or retained under subsections (1), (2), (3), and (4) by LN Ltd.
   - The court shall not take into account any sums which have become payable to LN Ltd under any contract of insurance due to the circumstances giving rise to the frustration of the contract.
   - There is no indication that there was an obligation to insure imposed by an express term of the frustrated contract or by or under any enactment.

### Conclusion:

LN Ltd can seek recovery of the £30,000 paid to the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union and the £50,000 paid to DSTR Ltd under the Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsections 3 and 4. The court will determine the just sum to be recovered, considering all circumstances of the case. LN Ltd is not bound to pay Gloop plc for the additional testing costs unless there is an express term in the contract requiring such payment.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum)

In the case of Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum (precedent p), the facts involved a dispute over the payment of cheques issued under alleged duress. The defendant claimed that the cheques were issued under threats of violence, which he argued constituted duress. The court ruled that the defendant's story was implausible and that there was no credible defence of duress. The court restored the order of the master, which was in favour of the plaintiff, Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Duress and Coercion**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (p)**: The defendant claimed that he issued cheques under threats of violence, which he argued constituted duress.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (c)**: LN Ltd was coerced into paying additional sums to the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union and DSTR Ltd under threats of operational disruption and cessation of delivery, respectively.

- **Legal Concept 2: Voluntariness of Consent**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (p)**: The court examined whether the defendant's consent to issue the cheques was voluntary or coerced.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (c)**: LN Ltd's consent to pay additional sums was given under the pressure of avoiding operational disruptions and ensuring continued delivery of essential materials.

- **Legal Concept 3: Economic Duress**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (p)**: The court considered whether the economic pressure exerted by the plaintiff amounted to duress.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (c)**: LN Ltd faced economic pressure from both the Union and DSTR Ltd, which could be argued as economic duress.

- **Legal Concept 4: Remedies for Duress**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (p)**: The court ruled that the defendant's claim of duress was not credible and thus did not provide a remedy.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (c)**: LN Ltd seeks to recover the sums paid under duress and to determine whether they are bound to pay Gloop plc for additional testing costs.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum)

This suggests a general rule that when we see **fact pattern i*** (claims of duress under economic or physical threats), the court should decide **outcome o** (whether the consent was voluntary and if the duress claim is credible). This rule was justified in Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum because the court found that the defendant's story was implausible and that there was no credible evidence of duress. The positive effects (E+) of this outcome include upholding the integrity of contractual agreements and ensuring that claims of duress are substantiated with credible evidence. The negative effects (E-) are minimal in this case, as the court's decision was based on a thorough examination of the facts and evidence presented.

Therefore, applying this rule to the current case, LN Ltd may argue that the payments made to the Union and DSTR Ltd were under economic duress and seek recovery of those sums. Additionally, LN Ltd can argue that they are not bound to pay Gloop plc for additional testing costs unless there is a clear contractual obligation to do so, and any coercion or duress in this context should be examined for credibility and voluntariness of consent.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Duress and Coercion**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (p)**: The defendant claimed that he issued cheques under threats of violence, which he argued constituted duress.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (c)**: LN Ltd was coerced into paying additional sums to the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union and DSTR Ltd under threats of operational disruption and cessation of delivery, respectively.

- **Legal Concept 2: Voluntariness of Consent**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (p)**: The court examined whether the defendant's consent to issue the cheques was voluntary or coerced.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (c)**: LN Ltd's consent to pay additional sums was given under the pressure of avoiding operational disruptions and ensuring continued delivery of essential materials.

- **Legal Concept 3: Economic Duress**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (p)**: The court considered whether the economic pressure exerted by the plaintiff amounted to duress.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (c)**: LN Ltd faced economic pressure from both the Union and DSTR Ltd, which could be argued as economic duress.

- **Legal Concept 4: Remedies for Duress**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (p)**: The court ruled that the defendant's claim of duress was not credible and thus did not provide a remedy.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (c)**: LN Ltd seeks to recover the sums paid under duress and to determine whether they are bound to pay Gloop plc for additional testing costs.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Contractual Integrity**: Ensuring that contracts are honored and that claims of duress are substantiated with credible evidence maintains the integrity of contractual agreements. This prevents parties from easily escaping their contractual obligations by making unsubstantiated claims of duress.

2. **Deterring Unlawful Coercion**: By recognizing and remedying economic duress, the court would deter parties from using unlawful coercion to extract payments or concessions. This promotes fair dealing and discourages the use of illegitimate pressure tactics in commercial transactions.

3. **Providing Clear Legal Guidance**: A consistent application of the legal principles surrounding duress provides clear guidance to businesses on the limits of acceptable conduct. This helps businesses understand their rights and obligations, reducing the likelihood of disputes and fostering a stable commercial environment.

4. **Ensuring Fairness**: By allowing LN Ltd to recover sums paid under duress, the court would ensure that businesses are not unfairly burdened by unlawful demands. This promotes fairness and equity in commercial relationships, ensuring that parties are not unjustly enriched at the expense of others.

Therefore, applying the rule from Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum to the current case, LN Ltd should be able to recover the sums paid to the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union and DSTR Ltd under economic duress. Additionally, LN Ltd should not be bound to pay Gloop plc for additional testing costs unless there is a clear contractual obligation to do so, and any coercion or duress in this context should be examined for credibility and voluntariness of consent.

Our current case involves an important factor, **the nature of the economic duress**, that was not present in **Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of duress and coercion.

In **Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum**, the court found the defendant's story of physical threats implausible and thus did not recognize a credible defence of duress. The court's decision was based on the lack of credible evidence of physical threats and the implausibility of the defendant's narrative.

However, in our current case, the economic duress faced by LN Ltd is more tangible and verifiable. LN Ltd was coerced into paying additional sums to the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union and DSTR Ltd under threats of operational disruption and cessation of delivery, respectively. These threats are not only credible but also have a direct and immediate impact on LN Ltd's business operations. The economic pressure exerted by the Union and DSTR Ltd is a significant factor that was not present in the precedent case.

Due to the presence of this economic duress, applying the same outcome (denying the defence of duress) in our case would have more negative consequences, such as:

1. **Encouraging Unlawful Economic Coercion**: Recognizing the payments made under economic duress as valid would encourage other parties to use similar coercive tactics to extract payments or concessions, leading to an increase in unlawful economic coercion in commercial transactions.

2. **Undermining Fair Commercial Practices**: It would undermine fair commercial practices by allowing parties to exploit their bargaining power to impose unfair terms on others, thereby disrupting the balance of power in commercial relationships.

3. **Financial Harm to Businesses**: It would cause financial harm to businesses like LN Ltd, which are forced to make payments under duress to avoid operational disruptions, thereby affecting their financial stability and competitiveness.

Unlike in **Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum**, where the court found no credible evidence of duress, the economic duress faced by LN Ltd is well-documented and has a direct impact on their business operations. Therefore, the presence of this crucial factor significantly alters the balance of positive and negative effects, and applying the same outcome would not be appropriate in our current case.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from **Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum** should be stated as: "When both [i*] (claims of duress under economic or physical threats) and [m] (credible evidence of economic duress with direct and immediate impact on business operations) are present, the court should decide [o] (recognize the defence of duress and allow recovery of sums paid under duress)." Omitting [m] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q] (encouraging unlawful economic coercion and undermining fair commercial practices).

Indeed, the opinion in **Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum** explicitly states that the court found the defendant's story implausible and that there was no credible evidence of duress. This highlights the importance of credible evidence in establishing a defence of duress. By including [m] (credible evidence of economic duress with direct and immediate impact on business operations), we ensure that only genuine cases of duress are recognized, thereby preventing the undesirable consequence of encouraging unlawful economic coercion.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in **Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum** was clearly designed to prevent [undesirable consequence u] (unsubstantiated claims of duress undermining the integrity of contractual agreements). However, in our current case, there's no risk of [u] occurring because LN Ltd's claims of economic duress are well-documented and have a direct and immediate impact on their business operations. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves (preventing unsubstantiated claims of duress) is not relevant to our situation where the duress is credible and substantiated.

By recognizing the credible evidence of economic duress faced by LN Ltd, the court would uphold fair commercial practices and deter unlawful coercion, aligning with the broader principles of contract law.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction

While it's true that our case lacks the factor of **physical threats** (factor m), which was present in the precedent case **Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of **claims of duress under economic or physical threats** (fact pattern i*) would lead to undesirable consequences. Specifically, it would mean that only cases involving physical threats could be recognized as duress, thereby excluding cases of economic duress which can be equally coercive and damaging. Conversely, not requiring the factor of physical threats would allow for the recognition of economic duress as a legitimate form of coercion, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law that aim to ensure fairness and voluntariness in contractual agreements. This approach would deter parties from using economic pressure to extract unfair concessions and would uphold the integrity of commercial transactions.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution

Although our case lacks the factor of **physical threats** (factor m), which was present in **Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum**, we have the additional factor of **credible economic duress with direct and immediate impact on business operations** (factor n). This factor n, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of **claims of duress under economic or physical threats** (fact pattern i*), serves a similar function to the physical threats in the precedent case. Given the presence of credible economic duress, we submit that the reasoning in **Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum** still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as upholding fair commercial practices and deterring unlawful coercion, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. Recognizing economic duress in our case would ensure that LN Ltd is not unfairly burdened by unlawful demands and would promote fairness and equity in commercial relationships.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **Chu Kong Highway Engineering Company Limited v Wong Cheung Sum**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of claims of duress under economic or physical threats and the examination of the voluntariness of consent. However, it also differs significantly in the nature of the duress involved—economic duress in the current case versus alleged physical threats in the precedent.

The proposed legal rule of recognizing duress when there is credible evidence of coercion, whether economic or physical, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of credible evidence in establishing duress (as emphasized in the precedent) and the need to recognize economic duress as a legitimate form of coercion (as argued in the current case).

Considering the underlying legal principles of ensuring fairness and voluntariness in contractual agreements and deterring unlawful coercion, we conclude that LN Ltd should be able to recover the sums paid to the Administrative Dock Workers’ Union and DSTR Ltd under economic duress. Additionally, LN Ltd should not be bound to pay Gloop plc for additional testing costs unless there is a clear contractual obligation to do so, and any coercion or duress in this context should be examined for credibility and voluntariness of consent.

This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by recognizing the legitimacy of economic duress and ensuring that businesses are not unfairly burdened by unlawful demands. The key factors that influenced this outcome include the credible evidence of economic duress faced by LN Ltd, the direct and immediate impact on their business operations, and the broader implications for fair commercial practices.
