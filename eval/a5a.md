### Legal Analysis of the Scenario

#### 1. Legal Issues

1. **Lawrence's Claim for Payment**:
   - Lawrence has completed part of the work (the private residence) but abandoned the project before completing the tea shop.
   - He claims £40,000 for the work done on the residential part of the project.

2. **Chris's Shoddy Workmanship**:
   - Chris completed the work on the tea shop, but Jessica claims the work is shoddy.
   - Specific defects include kitchen doors opening inwards instead of outwards and a sloping shop counter.
   - The cost to remedy the defects is £500.

3. **Luke's Contract Cancellation**:
   - Jessica cancelled the contract with Luke for the website.
   - Luke completed the work regardless and billed Jessica for £1,000.

4. **PoTe Ltd's Delivery of Non-Conforming Goods**:
   - Jessica ordered 60 teapots with a 1.2-litre capacity, but PoTe Ltd delivered teapots with a 1.3-litre capacity.
   - Jessica refuses to accept delivery and has sourced a better deal elsewhere.

#### 2. Applicable Laws

1. **Lawrence's Claim for Payment**:
   - **Partial Performance and Quantum Meruit**: Lawrence may claim payment for the work done under the doctrine of quantum meruit if the contract is divisible or if Jessica has accepted the partial performance.
   - **Breach of Contract**: Lawrence's abandonment of the project constitutes a breach of contract.

2. **Chris's Shoddy Workmanship**:
   - **Implied Terms in Construction Contracts**: Under common law and the Sale of Goods Ordinance (Cap. 26), there is an implied term that work will be carried out with reasonable care and skill.
   - **Remedies for Defective Work**: Jessica may claim damages for the cost of remedying the defects.

3. **Luke's Contract Cancellation**:
   - **Breach of Contract and Mitigation**: Jessica's cancellation may constitute a breach of contract, but Luke has a duty to mitigate his losses.
   - **Quantum Meruit**: Luke may claim for the value of the work done if it is beneficial to Jessica.

4. **PoTe Ltd's Delivery of Non-Conforming Goods**:
   - **Sale of Goods Ordinance (Cap. 26)**: Section 15 implies a condition that goods must correspond with their description.
   - **Rejection of Goods**: Jessica is entitled to reject the goods if they do not conform to the description.

#### 3. Application of Law to Facts

1. **Lawrence's Claim for Payment**:
   - **Partial Performance**: Lawrence has completed the residential part of the project. Under the principle of quantum meruit, he may be entitled to payment for the work done if the contract is divisible or if Jessica has accepted the partial performance.
   - **Breach of Contract**: Lawrence's abandonment of the project constitutes a breach of contract. Jessica may counterclaim for any additional costs incurred due to his breach, such as hiring Chris to complete the tea shop.

2. **Chris's Shoddy Workmanship**:
   - **Implied Terms**: Chris's work must meet the standard of reasonable care and skill. The defects (kitchen doors and sloping counter) indicate a breach of this implied term.
   - **Remedies**: Jessica is entitled to claim the cost of remedying the defects (£500) from Chris. This is supported by case law such as **Hoenig v Isaacs** [1952] 2 All ER 176, where the court allowed a deduction for the cost of remedying defects.

3. **Luke's Contract Cancellation**:
   - **Breach of Contract**: Jessica's cancellation of the contract may constitute a breach. However, Luke has a duty to mitigate his losses and should not complete the work if it is not required.
   - **Quantum Meruit**: If Luke's work is beneficial to Jessica, he may claim for the value of the work done. However, if the work is not required, he may not be entitled to the full contract price.

4. **PoTe Ltd's Delivery of Non-Conforming Goods**:
   - **Non-Conforming Goods**: The teapots delivered by PoTe Ltd do not match the description (1.2-litre capacity). Under Section 15 of the Sale of Goods Ordinance, Jessica is entitled to reject the goods.
   - **Rejection**: Jessica's refusal to accept the delivery is justified. She has no contractual liability to PoTe Ltd for the non-conforming goods.

### Conclusion

- **Lawrence**: Jessica may owe Lawrence for the work done on the residential part under quantum meruit, but she can counterclaim for any additional costs incurred due to his breach.
- **Chris**: Jessica can claim £500 from Chris for the cost of remedying the defects in his work.
- **Luke**: Jessica may not be liable for the full contract price if the work is not required. Luke should mitigate his losses.
- **PoTe Ltd**: Jessica is entitled to reject the non-conforming teapots and has no liability to PoTe Ltd.
