# Contract Law: Whether Lawrence is entitled to payment for partial performance of the contract

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 13A Subsection 1 and 2

### Major Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 13A Subsection 1 and 2

   Conditions:
   - There has been part performance of a contract.
   - There is a breach of the contract.
   - An order for specific performance could not be made by the court in the circumstances of the case.

   Consequences:
   - A court may award damages for the breach of the contract.

   Exceptions:
   - The contract was made before 31 December 1972.

### Minor Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 13A Subsection 1 and 2:
   - Lawrence has partially performed the contract by completing the work on the private residence.
   - Lawrence has breached the contract by walking off the site and not completing the work on the teashop.
   - An order for specific performance could not be made by the court in the circumstances of the case because Lawrence has already walked off the site and is engaged in another contract.
   - The contract between Jessica and Lawrence was made after 31 December 1972.

### Conclusion:

Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 13A Subsection 1 and 2 applies, and the court may award damages for the breach of the contract by Lawrence. Therefore, Lawrence is entitled to claim damages for the partial performance of the contract, which may include the £40,000 for the work done on the residential part of the project, subject to any counterclaims Jessica may have for the cost of completing the teashop and remedying defects.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA 1410/2009 BETWEEN TUNG NGAR AIR-CONDITION & STEEL Plaintiff HOLDINGS LIMITED and SHING HIN CATERING GROUP LIMITED Defendant)
In the case of HCA 1410/2009 BETWEEN TUNG NGAR AIR-CONDITION & STEEL Plaintiff HOLDINGS LIMITED and SHING HIN CATERING GROUP LIMITED Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the plaintiff had achieved practical or substantial completion of the works on 6 March 2009, despite some minor defects. The court held that the plaintiff was entitled to payment of the contract price when due, subject to set-off or counterclaim for the defects.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA 1410/2009 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Substantial Completion**: In HCA 1410/2009, the court considered whether the plaintiff had substantially completed the work despite minor defects. Similarly, in our current case, Lawrence has completed the work on the private residence but not the teashop.
- **Legal Concept 2: Payment for Partial Performance**: In HCA 1410/2009, the court ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to payment for the work completed, subject to deductions for defects. In our current case, Lawrence is seeking payment for the work completed on the private residence.
- **Legal Concept 3: Defects and Remedial Costs**: In HCA 1410/2009, the court allowed for set-off or counterclaim for the cost of remedying defects. In our current case, Jessica claims that the work done by Chris is shoddy and requires £500 to remedy the defects.
- **Legal Concept 4: Contractual Obligations and Variations**: In HCA 1410/2009, the court considered whether certain items were within the scope of the contract or subsequent additions. In our current case, Luke's work on the website and PoTe Ltd's delivery of teapots involve questions of whether the delivered goods and services meet the contractual obligations.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA 1410/2009)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of substantial completion with minor defects, the court should decide that the contractor is entitled to payment for the work completed, subject to deductions for the cost of remedying the defects. This rule was justified in HCA 1410/2009 because the positive effects of ensuring contractors are paid for substantial completion (E+) on the underlying values and principles of the law, such as fairness and encouraging the completion of contractual obligations, outweigh the negative effects (E-) of allowing minor defects to delay or negate payment. 

Applying this rule to our current case:
- **Lawrence**: Lawrence is entitled to payment for the work completed on the private residence, subject to any deductions for the cost of completing the teashop.
- **Chris**: Jessica may be required to pay Chris for the work completed, but she can set off the £500 cost of remedying the defects.
- **Luke**: Since Jessica cancelled the contract before completion, Luke may not be entitled to payment unless he can prove substantial completion of the work contracted.
- **PoTe Ltd**: Jessica can refuse delivery of the teapots as they do not match the description on the order form, which is a fundamental term of the contract.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA 1410/2009 BETWEEN TUNG NGAR AIR-CONDITION & STEEL Plaintiff HOLDINGS LIMITED and SHING HIN CATERING GROUP LIMITED Defendant) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Substantial Completion**: In HCA 1410/2009, the court considered whether the plaintiff had substantially completed the work despite minor defects. Similarly, in our current case, Lawrence has completed the work on the private residence but not the teashop.
- **Legal Concept 2: Payment for Partial Performance**: In HCA 1410/2009, the court ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to payment for the work completed, subject to deductions for defects. In our current case, Lawrence is seeking payment for the work completed on the private residence.
- **Legal Concept 3: Defects and Remedial Costs**: In HCA 1410/2009, the court allowed for set-off or counterclaim for the cost of remedying defects. In our current case, Jessica claims that the work done by Chris is shoddy and requires £500 to remedy the defects.
- **Legal Concept 4: Contractual Obligations and Variations**: In HCA 1410/2009, the court considered whether certain items were within the scope of the contract or subsequent additions. In our current case, Luke's work on the website and PoTe Ltd's delivery of teapots involve questions of whether the delivered goods and services meet the contractual obligations.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA 1410/2009, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Lawrence**: Lawrence is entitled to payment for the work completed on the private residence, subject to any deductions for the cost of completing the teashop. This ensures fairness and encourages contractors to complete their obligations, even if they cannot finish the entire project.
   
2. **Chris**: Jessica may be required to pay Chris for the work completed, but she can set off the £500 cost of remedying the defects. This balances the interests of both parties by ensuring that Chris is compensated for his work while also holding him accountable for the quality of his work.

3. **Luke**: Since Jessica cancelled the contract before completion, Luke may not be entitled to payment unless he can prove substantial completion of the work contracted. This upholds the principle that payment is due only for work that meets the contractual obligations.

4. **PoTe Ltd**: Jessica can refuse delivery of the teapots as they do not match the description on the order form, which is a fundamental term of the contract. This protects Jessica's right to receive goods that conform to the contract specifications.

By applying the same rule from HCA 1410/2009, the court would promote fairness, encourage the completion of contractual obligations, and ensure that parties are held accountable for meeting the terms of their contracts.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA 1410/2009 BETWEEN TUNG NGAR AIR-CONDITION & STEEL Plaintiff HOLDINGS LIMITED and SHING HIN CATERING GROUP LIMITED Defendant, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of a detailed defects list and the subsequent rectification efforts by the plaintiff. This defects list was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—such as fairness in payment for substantial completion and encouraging contractors to rectify defects—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided a clear record of the issues and the steps taken to address them. However, in our current case, this crucial detailed defects list and subsequent rectification efforts are notably absent. Lawrence has walked off the site without providing a detailed list of defects or making any rectification efforts, which complicates the assessment of whether substantial completion has been achieved.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—Jessica's engagement of Chris to complete the work on the teashop—that was not present in HCA 1410/2009. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces a new contractor who has completed the remaining work, albeit with defects. Due to this involvement of a second contractor, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as complicating the assessment of liability and payment between multiple parties, than positive ones. Unlike in HCA 1410/2009, where the plaintiff was solely responsible for the entire project and its defects, the current case involves multiple contractors, which affects the determination of substantial completion and the allocation of payment and liability.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA 1410/2009 BETWEEN TUNG NGAR AIR-CONDITION & STEEL Plaintiff HOLDINGS LIMITED and SHING HIN CATERING GROUP LIMITED Defendant should be stated as: "When both substantial completion with minor defects and a detailed defects list with subsequent rectification efforts are present, the court should decide that the contractor is entitled to payment for the work completed, subject to deductions for the cost of remedying the defects." Omitting the requirement for a detailed defects list and subsequent rectification efforts from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of contractors being paid for incomplete or substandard work without any accountability for rectifying defects. Indeed, the opinion in HCA 1410/2009 explicitly states that the detailed defects list and the subsequent rectification efforts were crucial to their decision, as it provided a clear record of the issues and the steps taken to address them.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA 1410/2009 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of contractors being paid for incomplete or substandard work without any accountability for rectifying defects. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because Lawrence has not provided a detailed defects list or made any rectification efforts. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Without the detailed defects list and subsequent rectification efforts, it is difficult to assess whether substantial completion has been achieved, and thus, Lawrence should not be entitled to payment for the work completed on the private residence.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the detailed defects list and subsequent rectification efforts, which were present in the precedent case HCA 1410/2009 BETWEEN TUNG NGAR AIR-CONDITION & STEEL Plaintiff HOLDINGS LIMITED and SHING HIN CATERING GROUP LIMITED Defendant, requiring this factor for all similar cases of substantial completion with minor defects would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would allow contractors to avoid payment for substantial work completed simply because they did not provide a detailed defects list or make rectification efforts. Conversely, not requiring the detailed defects list and subsequent rectification efforts would allow for a more flexible and fair approach, ensuring that contractors are compensated for substantial work completed while still holding them accountable for any defects. This better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, such as fairness and encouraging the completion of contractual obligations.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the detailed defects list and subsequent rectification efforts, which were present in HCA 1410/2009, we have the additional factor of Jessica engaging Chris to complete the work on the teashop. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of substantial completion with minor defects, serves a similar function to the detailed defects list and rectification efforts in the precedent case. Given the presence of Chris completing the work, we submit that the reasoning in HCA 1410/2009 still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as ensuring contractors are paid for substantial completion and holding them accountable for defects, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA 1410/2009 BETWEEN TUNG NGAR AIR-CONDITION & STEEL Plaintiff HOLDINGS LIMITED and SHING HIN CATERING GROUP LIMITED Defendant, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the concept of substantial completion with minor defects and the issue of payment for partial performance. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of a detailed defects list and subsequent rectification efforts by Lawrence, and the involvement of a second contractor, Chris, to complete the work.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case—that a contractor is entitled to payment for substantial completion subject to deductions for defects—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the missing detailed defects list and rectification efforts in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides. A strong point from the initial analogy is that substantial completion should entitle a contractor to payment, promoting fairness and encouraging the completion of contractual obligations. On the other hand, a strong point from the rebuttal is that without a detailed defects list and rectification efforts, it is challenging to assess whether substantial completion has truly been achieved, which could lead to contractors being paid for incomplete or substandard work.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, accountability, and encouraging the completion of contractual obligations, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that:

1. **Lawrence**: Lawrence is not entitled to payment for the work completed on the private residence without providing a detailed defects list and making rectification efforts. This ensures accountability and prevents payment for incomplete or substandard work.

2. **Chris**: Jessica may be required to pay Chris for the work completed, but she can set off the £500 cost of remedying the defects. This balances the interests of both parties by ensuring that Chris is compensated for his work while also holding him accountable for the quality of his work.

3. **Luke**: Since Jessica cancelled the contract before completion, Luke may not be entitled to payment unless he can prove substantial completion of the work contracted. This upholds the principle that payment is due only for work that meets the contractual obligations.

4. **PoTe Ltd**: Jessica can refuse delivery of the teapots as they do not match the description on the order form, which is a fundamental term of the contract. This protects Jessica's right to receive goods that conform to the contract specifications.

In conclusion, the decision reached aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by ensuring that contractors are held accountable for meeting the terms of their contracts and providing a fair resolution for all parties involved.

### Minor Premise:

1. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 7 Subsection 1:
   - Jessica and Lawrence have a contract for the supply of a service (conversion of the mill).
   - The consideration for the service is determined by the contract (£100,000).
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

2. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 6 Subsection 1:
   - Jessica and Lawrence have a contract for the supply of a service by Lawrence acting in the course of a business.
   - The time for the service to be carried out is not fixed by the contract.

### Conclusion:

Lawrence has breached the implied terms under the Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Sections 5 and 6 by not completing the work within a reasonable time and not carrying out the service with reasonable care and skill. Therefore, Jessica can refuse to pay Lawrence for the incomplete work.

## Deductive Reasoning: cfi

### Relevant law:

Prime View Inc. Limited v Asian Richly Limited

### Major Premise:

1. Prime View Inc. Limited v Asian Richly Limited

   Conditions:
   - A contractor fails to complete the renovation project as agreed.
   - The contract is divisible, meaning the divided parts could be viewed as separate contracts.

   Consequences:
   - The employer may be entitled to claim a refund of overpayment based on the difference in cost to the builder of the actual work done and work specified.

   Exceptions:
   - The contract is not divisible, meaning it does not create an obligation to pay for a divisible part of the performance which is independent of the performance of the other parts of the contract.

### Minor Premise:

1. Prime View Inc. Limited v Asian Richly Limited:
- Lawrence has failed to complete the renovation project as agreed.
- The contract between Jessica and Lawrence is not explicitly stated to be divisible. The entire project was agreed upon for a lump sum of £100,000 payable on completion, indicating it is likely not divisible.
- Since the contract is not divisible, it does not create an obligation to pay for a divisible part of the performance which is independent of the performance of the other parts of the contract.

### Conclusion:

Prime View Inc. Limited v Asian Richly Limited does not apply because the contract between Jessica and Lawrence is not divisible. Therefore, Jessica is not obligated to pay Lawrence for the incomplete work on the residential part of the project.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (Golden Sand Marble Factory Limited v Hunnewell Limited)

In the case of Golden Sand Marble Factory Limited v Hunnewell Limited (precedent p), the plaintiff, Golden Sand Marble Factory Limited, was contracted to perform marble redecoration work for the defendant, Hunnewell Limited. The plaintiff abandoned the work before completion, claiming additional payments were due. The court ruled that the plaintiff's abandonment of the work amounted to repudiation of the contract, giving the defendant the right to accept that repudiation and seek remedies. The court found that there was no substantial completion of the work, and thus the plaintiff was not entitled to the remainder of the contract price. The defendant's claim for liquidated damages was dismissed due to lack of clarity in the contract clause, but the defendant was awarded nominal damages for financial loss.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in Golden Sand Marble Factory Limited v Hunnewell Limited and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Repudiation of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In both cases, the contractor (plaintiff in precedent, Lawrence in current case) abandoned the work before completion.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Substantial Completion**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** In both cases, the issue of whether the work was substantially completed was central to determining entitlement to payment.
  
- **Legal Concept 3: Right to Payment**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In both cases, the contractor claimed additional payments were due despite the work being incomplete.
  
- **Legal Concept 4: Remedies for Incomplete Work**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** In both cases, the employer (defendant in precedent, Jessica in current case) engaged another contractor to complete the work and sought remedies for the incomplete work.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (Golden Sand Marble Factory Limited v Hunnewell Limited)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a contractor abandoning work before completion (fact pattern i*), the court should decide that the contractor has repudiated the contract and is not entitled to the remainder of the contract price (outcome o). This rule was justified in Golden Sand Marble Factory Limited v Hunnewell Limited because the positive effects (E+) of outcome o on the underlying values and principles of the law, such as ensuring contractual obligations are fulfilled and protecting the interests of the employer, outweigh the negative effects (E-) in that case. The court emphasized the importance of substantial completion and the lack of entitlement to payment for incomplete work, which aligns with the principles of fairness and contractual integrity.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (Golden Sand Marble Factory Limited v Hunnewell Limited) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Repudiation of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** Lawrence, like the plaintiff in the precedent case, abandoned the work before completion to pursue a more lucrative contract elsewhere.

- **Legal Concept 2: Substantial Completion**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** Lawrence completed the work on the private residence but did not complete the work on the teashop, similar to how the plaintiff in the precedent case did not complete the marble redecoration work.

- **Legal Concept 3: Right to Payment**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** Lawrence is claiming £40,000 for the work done on the residential part of the project, akin to the plaintiff in the precedent case claiming additional payments despite the work being incomplete.

- **Legal Concept 4: Remedies for Incomplete Work**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** Jessica engaged Chris to complete the work on the teashop, similar to how the defendant in the precedent case engaged another contractor to complete the marble redecoration work.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome: Lawrence's abandonment of the work amounts to repudiation of the contract, and he is not entitled to the remainder of the contract price. This decision would be justified because, as in Golden Sand Marble Factory Limited v Hunnewell Limited, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Contractual Obligations are Fulfilled:** By ruling that Lawrence is not entitled to payment for incomplete work, the court would reinforce the principle that contractors must fulfill their contractual obligations to be entitled to payment.
   
2. **Protecting the Interests of the Employer:** This outcome protects Jessica's interests by ensuring she does not have to pay for incomplete work and can seek remedies for the additional costs incurred to complete the project.

3. **Promoting Fairness and Contractual Integrity:** The decision aligns with the principles of fairness and contractual integrity, ensuring that parties cannot unilaterally abandon their contractual duties without consequences.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in Golden Sand Marble Factory Limited v Hunnewell Limited, it would have the positive effects of ensuring contractual obligations are fulfilled, protecting the interests of the employer, and promoting fairness and contractual integrity.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case Golden Sand Marble Factory Limited v Hunnewell Limited, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the plaintiff's abandonment of the work was not backed by any professional assessment of the remaining work's cost. This lack of professional assessment was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—such as ensuring contractual obligations are fulfilled and protecting the interests of the employer—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it demonstrated that the plaintiff's claim for additional payment was not substantiated by reliable evidence. However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as Lawrence has not provided any professional assessment to substantiate his claim for the £40,000 for the work done on the residential part of the project. This absence weakens Lawrence's position and aligns with the precedent's emphasis on the need for substantiated claims.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in Golden Sand Marble Factory Limited v Hunnewell Limited: the issue of shoddy workmanship by the subsequent contractor, Chris. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces an additional layer of complexity regarding the quality of the completed work. Due to this factor, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as Jessica being unfairly burdened with the cost of rectifying Chris's defective work, than positive ones, unlike in Golden Sand Marble Factory Limited v Hunnewell Limited. This is because the precedent case did not involve a subsequent contractor whose work was also defective, thereby complicating the assessment of whether the original contractor (Lawrence) should be paid for the work completed.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from Golden Sand Marble Factory Limited v Hunnewell Limited should be stated as: "When both the contractor abandons the work before completion (i*) and the subsequent contractor's work is also defective (m), the court should decide that the original contractor is not entitled to the remainder of the contract price (o)." Omitting the factor of the subsequent contractor's defective work (m) from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence (q) of the employer being unfairly burdened with the cost of rectifying the defective work of the subsequent contractor, in addition to the incomplete work of the original contractor. Indeed, the opinion in Golden Sand Marble Factory Limited v Hunnewell Limited explicitly states that the lack of professional assessment of the remaining work's cost was crucial to their decision, highlighting the importance of substantiated claims for additional payments.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in Golden Sand Marble Factory Limited v Hunnewell Limited was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence (u) of contractors abandoning their work and still claiming payment without substantiated evidence of the work completed. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence occurring because Lawrence has not provided any professional assessment to substantiate his claim for the £40,000 for the work done on the residential part of the project. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—to prevent unsubstantiated claims for payment—is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the focus should be on the additional complexity introduced by the subsequent contractor's defective work, which was not a factor in the precedent case.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of a professional assessment of the remaining work's cost, which was present in the precedent case Golden Sand Marble Factory Limited v Hunnewell Limited, requiring this factor for all similar cases of a contractor abandoning work before completion would lead to the undesirable consequence of allowing contractors to claim payment without substantiated evidence, thereby undermining the principle of fairness and contractual integrity. Conversely, not requiring a professional assessment would allow for a more equitable outcome, ensuring that contractors cannot unilaterally abandon their contractual duties and still claim payment, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, such as ensuring contractual obligations are fulfilled and protecting the interests of the employer.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of a professional assessment of the remaining work's cost, which was present in Golden Sand Marble Factory Limited v Hunnewell Limited, we have the additional factor of the subsequent contractor's defective work. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of a contractor abandoning work before completion, serves a similar function to the professional assessment in the precedent case. Given the presence of the subsequent contractor's defective work, we submit that the reasoning in Golden Sand Marble Factory Limited v Hunnewell Limited still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as ensuring contractual obligations are fulfilled and protecting the interests of the employer, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to Golden Sand Marble Factory Limited v Hunnewell Limited, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the contractor abandoning the work before completion and the issue of whether the work was substantially completed. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the presence of shoddy workmanship by the subsequent contractor, Chris, and the lack of a professional assessment to substantiate Lawrence's claim for additional payment.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case—that a contractor who abandons work before completion is not entitled to the remainder of the contract price—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the additional complexities introduced by the subsequent contractor's defective work in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of ensuring contractual obligations are fulfilled and protecting the interests of the employer (as argued in the initial analogy) against the potential unfair burden on Jessica due to the defective work of the subsequent contractor (as highlighted in the rebuttal arguments).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, contractual integrity, and the need for substantiated claims for payment, we conclude that Lawrence's abandonment of the work amounts to repudiation of the contract, and he is not entitled to the remainder of the contract price. This decision aligns with the precedent set in Golden Sand Marble Factory Limited v Hunnewell Limited and serves the interests of justice by ensuring that contractors cannot unilaterally abandon their contractual duties without consequences.

However, Jessica's refusal to pay Chris for the work completed, despite the defects, must be addressed separately. Given that the cost to remedy the defects is £500, Jessica should be entitled to deduct this amount from the payment due to Chris, but she should still pay the remaining £39,500 for the work completed.

Regarding Luke, since Jessica canceled the contract before its completion and Luke decided to complete the work regardless of Jessica's wishes, Luke is not entitled to payment for the work done. The contract was effectively terminated by Jessica, and Luke's decision to proceed was unilateral and not binding on Jessica.

Finally, concerning PoTe Ltd, Jessica is within her rights to refuse delivery of the teapots as they do not match the description on the website or order form. The discrepancy in capacity constitutes a breach of contract, and Jessica is not contractually obligated to accept or pay for the non-conforming goods.

In summary:
1. Lawrence is not entitled to the remainder of the contract price due to repudiation.
2. Jessica should pay Chris £39,500, deducting £500 for the cost to remedy the defects.
3. Luke is not entitled to payment for the work done after the contract was canceled.
4. Jessica is not liable to accept or pay for the teapots from PoTe Ltd due to the discrepancy in capacity.

This decision balances the need to uphold contractual obligations and fairness while considering the specific circumstances of each party involved.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (CHINA STATE FOUNDATION ENGINEERING LTD v. GOLD BRILLIANT INVESTMENT LTD)

In the case of CHINA STATE FOUNDATION ENGINEERING LTD v. GOLD BRILLIANT INVESTMENT LTD (precedent p), the Plaintiff sought summary judgment for a sum due under a dishonoured cheque. The Defendant opposed the summary judgment, asserting a set-off defence for liquidated damages due to delay in completion of works and an alleged agreement defence. The court ruled that the Defendant's claim for liquidated damages was indeed a liquidated claim, allowing the set-off defence to be valid.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in CHINA STATE FOUNDATION ENGINEERING LTD v. GOLD BRILLIANT INVESTMENT LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Breach of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In the precedent case, the Defendant claimed liquidated damages due to the Plaintiff's delay in completing the works. In the current case, Lawrence breached the contract by walking off the site before completing the work on the tea shop.

- **Legal Concept 2: Liquidated Damages**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** In the precedent case, the contract included a liquidated damages clause for delays. In the current case, while there is no explicit mention of a liquidated damages clause, the concept of damages for incomplete work is relevant.

- **Legal Concept 3: Set-off Defence**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In the precedent case, the Defendant used the set-off defence to counter the Plaintiff's claim. In the current case, Jessica could potentially use a similar defence against Lawrence's claim for £40,000 by arguing the cost to complete the work and remedy defects.

- **Legal Concept 4: Contractual Obligations and Remedies**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** In the precedent case, the court considered the contractual obligations and the remedies available under the contract. In the current case, Jessica's obligations to Lawrence, Chris, Luke, and PoTe Ltd. need to be assessed based on the contractual terms and the remedies available for breaches.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (CHINA STATE FOUNDATION ENGINEERING LTD v. GOLD BRILLIANT INVESTMENT LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see a breach of contract involving incomplete work and a claim for damages, the court should decide that the party claiming damages can set off the costs incurred to complete the work and remedy defects against the amount claimed by the breaching party. This rule was justified in CHINA STATE FOUNDATION ENGINEERING LTD v. GOLD BRILLIANT INVESTMENT LTD because the positive effects (E+) of allowing a set-off defence promote fairness and ensure that the non-breaching party is not unduly penalised for the breaching party's failure to fulfil contractual obligations. The negative effects (E-) are minimal as the set-off defence is only allowed when the claim for damages is liquidated and ascertainable, ensuring that the defence is not abused.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (CHINA STATE FOUNDATION ENGINEERING LTD v. GOLD BRILLIANT INVESTMENT LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Breach of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** Lawrence breached the contract by walking off the site before completing the work on the tea shop, similar to the delay in completion of works in the precedent case.

- **Legal Concept 2: Liquidated Damages**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** While there is no explicit mention of a liquidated damages clause in the current case, the concept of damages for incomplete work is relevant. Jessica can claim damages for the cost to complete the work and remedy defects, similar to the liquidated damages for delay in the precedent case.

- **Legal Concept 3: Set-off Defence**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** Jessica could potentially use a set-off defence against Lawrence's claim for £40,000 by arguing the cost to complete the work and remedy defects, similar to the set-off defence used in the precedent case.

- **Legal Concept 4: Contractual Obligations and Remedies**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** Jessica's obligations to Lawrence, Chris, Luke, and PoTe Ltd. need to be assessed based on the contractual terms and the remedies available for breaches, similar to the assessment of contractual obligations and remedies in the precedent case.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in CHINA STATE FOUNDATION ENGINEERING LTD v. GOLD BRILLIANT INVESTMENT LTD, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Promoting Fairness:** Allowing Jessica to set off the costs incurred to complete the work and remedy defects against Lawrence's claim ensures that she is not unduly penalised for Lawrence's failure to fulfil his contractual obligations.
2. **Encouraging Contractual Compliance:** This outcome reinforces the importance of fulfilling contractual obligations and discourages parties from abandoning projects midway.
3. **Ensuring Equitable Remedies:** By allowing a set-off defence, the court ensures that the remedies available are equitable and just, taking into account the actual costs incurred by the non-breaching party.

Therefore, the court should allow Jessica to set off the costs incurred to complete the work and remedy defects against Lawrence's claim for £40,000. This decision aligns with the principles established in the precedent case and promotes fairness and contractual compliance.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **CHINA STATE FOUNDATION ENGINEERING LTD v. GOLD BRILLIANT INVESTMENT LTD**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of a **liquidated damages clause** in the contract. This clause was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as promoting fairness and ensuring that the non-breaching party is not unduly penalised, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided a clear, pre-agreed formula for calculating damages. However, in our current case, this crucial **liquidated damages clause** is notably absent as there is no explicit mention of such a clause in the contract between Jessica and Lawrence. This absence means that the damages for incomplete work are not pre-ascertained and would require further investigation and assessment, potentially altering the balance of positive and negative effects.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor **(the quality of work and specific defects)** that was not present in **CHINA STATE FOUNDATION ENGINEERING LTD v. GOLD BRILLIANT INVESTMENT LTD**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the quality of work and specific defects (e.g., doors opening inwards instead of outwards, sloping shop counter) introduce additional complexities that were not considered in the precedent case. Due to these specific defects, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as unfairly obligating Jessica to pay for substandard work and potentially incurring additional costs to remedy these defects, unlike in **CHINA STATE FOUNDATION ENGINEERING LTD v. GOLD BRILLIANT INVESTMENT LTD** where the dispute was primarily about delay and liquidated damages. The presence of these specific defects necessitates a more nuanced approach to ensure that Jessica is not unfairly penalised for the contractor's substandard work.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **CHINA STATE FOUNDATION ENGINEERING LTD v. GOLD BRILLIANT INVESTMENT LTD** should be stated as: "When both [a breach of contract involving incomplete work] and [the presence of a liquidated damages clause] are present, the court should decide [that the party claiming damages can set off the costs incurred to complete the work and remedy defects against the amount claimed by the breaching party]." Omitting [the presence of a liquidated damages clause] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of unfairly obligating the non-breaching party to pay for incomplete or substandard work without a clear, pre-agreed formula for calculating damages]. Indeed, the opinion in **CHINA STATE FOUNDATION ENGINEERING LTD v. GOLD BRILLIANT INVESTMENT LTD** explicitly states that [the liquidated damages clause was crucial to their decision, as it provided a clear, pre-agreed formula for calculating damages].

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **CHINA STATE FOUNDATION ENGINEERING LTD v. GOLD BRILLIANT INVESTMENT LTD** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of a non-breaching party being unfairly penalised for the breaching party's failure to fulfil contractual obligations, by ensuring that damages are pre-ascertained and calculable]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [this specific undesirable consequence occurring] because [the absence of a liquidated damages clause means that the damages for incomplete work are not pre-ascertained and would require further investigation and assessment]. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the explicit presence of a liquidated damages clause, which was present in the precedent case **CHINA STATE FOUNDATION ENGINEERING LTD v. GOLD BRILLIANT INVESTMENT LTD**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of breach of contract involving incomplete work would lead to the undesirable consequence of non-breaching parties being left without a clear remedy for incomplete or substandard work. Conversely, not requiring an explicit liquidated damages clause would allow for a more flexible and equitable approach, ensuring that non-breaching parties like Jessica can still claim reasonable costs incurred to complete the work and remedy defects. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which aim to ensure fairness and uphold the contractual obligations of the parties.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the explicit presence of a liquidated damages clause, which was present in **CHINA STATE FOUNDATION ENGINEERING LTD v. GOLD BRILLIANT INVESTMENT LTD**, we have the additional factor of specific defects in the work completed by Chris. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of breach of contract and incomplete work, serves a similar function to the liquidated damages clause in the precedent case. Given the presence of specific defects, we submit that the reasoning in **CHINA STATE FOUNDATION ENGINEERING LTD v. GOLD BRILLIANT INVESTMENT LTD** still applies, as the positive effects on ensuring fairness and equitable remedies would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **CHINA STATE FOUNDATION ENGINEERING LTD v. GOLD BRILLIANT INVESTMENT LTD**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the breach of contract involving incomplete work and the concept of damages for incomplete work. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of a liquidated damages clause and the presence of specific defects in the work completed by Chris.

The proposed legal rule of allowing a set-off defence for costs incurred to complete the work and remedy defects finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of a liquidated damages clause in the precedent case and the need for a flexible and equitable approach in the current case.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, contractual compliance, and equitable remedies, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Jessica should be allowed to set off the costs incurred to complete the work and remedy defects against Lawrence's claim for £40,000. This decision aligns with the principles established in the precedent case and promotes fairness and contractual compliance, even in the absence of a liquidated damages clause.

Key factors that influenced this outcome include:

1. **Promoting Fairness:** Allowing Jessica to set off the costs ensures she is not unduly penalised for Lawrence's failure to fulfil his contractual obligations.
2. **Encouraging Contractual Compliance:** This outcome reinforces the importance of fulfilling contractual obligations and discourages parties from abandoning projects midway.
3. **Ensuring Equitable Remedies:** By allowing a set-off defence, the court ensures that the remedies available are equitable and just, taking into account the actual costs incurred by the non-breaching party.

Therefore, Jessica can claim damages from Lawrence for breach of contract and set off the costs incurred to complete the work and remedy defects against Lawrence's claim for £40,000. This decision is justified by the need to ensure fairness and uphold the contractual obligations of the parties.


# Contract Law: Whether Chris's work on the teashop meets the contractual standards

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HIP HING CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. HONG KONG AIRLINES LTD)

In the case of HIP HING CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. HONG KONG AIRLINES LTD [2022] HKCFI 622; HCCT 72/2021 (precedent p), the Plaintiff, Hip Hing Construction Co Ltd, sought summary judgment against the Defendant, Hong Kong Airlines Ltd, for an outstanding contract sum. The court ruled that the Defendant had an arguable set-off or counterclaim in respect of its loss arising from water leakage issues, but the Defendant failed to provide sufficient particulars for other alleged defects. Consequently, the court granted summary judgment for the Plaintiff for the amount not covered by the arguable set-off or counterclaim.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in HIP HING CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. HONG KONG AIRLINES LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Contractual Obligations and Breach**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (Precedent):** The Defendant failed to pay the outstanding contract sum as per the Agreement.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (Current Case):** Lawrence walked off the site before completing the work, claiming Jessica owes him £40,000 for the work done on the residential part of the project.

- **Legal Concept 2: Quality of Work and Defects**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (Precedent):** The Defendant claimed set-off or counterclaim for defective building works, particularly water leakages.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (Current Case):** Jessica claims the work done by Chris on the teashop is shoddy, with specific defects such as inward-opening kitchen doors and a sloping shop counter.

- **Legal Concept 3: Particularisation of Claims**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (Precedent):** The Defendant failed to provide sufficient particulars for the costs of rectifying other defects.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (Current Case):** Jessica has identified specific defects in Chris's work and the cost to remedy these defects is £500.

- **Legal Concept 4: Mitigation of Loss**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (Precedent):** The Defendant was under a duty to mitigate its loss but failed to provide adequate evidence for certain claims.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (Current Case):** Jessica has engaged Chris to complete the work on the teashop after Lawrence walked off, thereby mitigating her loss.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HIP HING CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. HONG KONG AIRLINES LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern where a party claims defects in the work performed and provides sufficient particulars for the cost of rectification, the court should allow for a set-off or counterclaim to the extent of the rectification costs. This rule was justified in HIP HING CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. HONG KONG AIRLINES LTD because the positive effects (E+) of allowing a set-off or counterclaim for well-particularised defects ensure that parties are held accountable for the quality of their work and that the aggrieved party is compensated for the cost of rectification. This outweighs the negative effects (E-) of potentially delaying the resolution of the primary claim.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HIP HING CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. HONG KONG AIRLINES LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Contractual Obligations and Breach**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (Precedent):** The Defendant failed to pay the outstanding contract sum as per the Agreement.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (Current Case):** Lawrence walked off the site before completing the work, claiming Jessica owes him £40,000 for the work done on the residential part of the project.

- **Legal Concept 2: Quality of Work and Defects**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (Precedent):** The Defendant claimed set-off or counterclaim for defective building works, particularly water leakages.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (Current Case):** Jessica claims the work done by Chris on the teashop is shoddy, with specific defects such as inward-opening kitchen doors and a sloping shop counter.

- **Legal Concept 3: Particularisation of Claims**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (Precedent):** The Defendant failed to provide sufficient particulars for the costs of rectifying other defects.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (Current Case):** Jessica has identified specific defects in Chris's work and the cost to remedy these defects is £500.

- **Legal Concept 4: Mitigation of Loss**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (Precedent):** The Defendant was under a duty to mitigate its loss but failed to provide adequate evidence for certain claims.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (Current Case):** Jessica has engaged Chris to complete the work on the teashop after Lawrence walked off, thereby mitigating her loss.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach a similar outcome as in HIP HING CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. HONG KONG AIRLINES LTD. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Accountability for Quality of Work:** Allowing Jessica to set-off the cost of rectifying the defects in Chris's work ensures that contractors are held accountable for the quality of their work. This aligns with the principle that parties should fulfill their contractual obligations to the agreed standard.

2. **Fair Compensation:** By permitting a set-off for the rectification costs, the court ensures that Jessica is fairly compensated for the additional expenses incurred due to the defects. This upholds the principle of fairness in contractual dealings.

3. **Encouragement of Detailed Claims:** Requiring detailed particulars for claims, as seen in the precedent, encourages parties to provide clear and specific evidence for their claims. This promotes transparency and aids the court in making informed decisions.

4. **Mitigation of Loss:** Recognizing Jessica's efforts to mitigate her loss by engaging Chris to complete the work after Lawrence walked off supports the principle that parties should take reasonable steps to minimize their losses.

Therefore, the court should allow Jessica to set-off the £500 cost of rectifying the defects in Chris's work against any amount claimed by Chris. Additionally, Lawrence's claim for £40,000 should be scrutinized in light of his breach of contract by walking off the site. Luke's claim for £1,000 should be dismissed as he completed the work against Jessica's wishes, and PoTe Ltd's delivery of teapots that do not match the description justifies Jessica's refusal to accept them.

This decision would be justified because, as in HIP HING CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. HONG KONG AIRLINES LTD, it would ensure accountability, fairness, transparency, and the encouragement of loss mitigation in contractual relationships.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HIP HING CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. HONG KONG AIRLINES LTD, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of detailed and contemporaneous evidence regarding the defects and the costs of rectification. This detailed evidence was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as accountability for quality of work and fair compensation, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided a clear basis for assessing the merits of the set-off or counterclaim. However, in our current case, this crucial detailed and contemporaneous evidence is notably absent as Jessica has only provided a general estimate of £500 for the cost to remedy the defects in Chris's work without detailed breakdowns or supporting documentation.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the engagement of a third party (Chris) to complete the work after Lawrence walked off, that was not present in HIP HING CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. HONG KONG AIRLINES LTD. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces an additional layer of contractual obligations and potential liabilities. Due to this factor, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as complicating the assessment of liability and the apportionment of costs between multiple parties, than positive ones, unlike in HIP HING CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. HONG KONG AIRLINES LTD. This is because the involvement of a third party in completing the work introduces new variables that were not considered in the precedent case, making it more challenging to determine the appropriate set-off or counterclaim.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HIP HING CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. HONG KONG AIRLINES LTD should be stated as: "When both the fact pattern of a party claiming defects in the work performed and providing sufficient particulars for the cost of rectification (i*) and the involvement of a third party to complete the work after the original contractor walked off (m) are present, the court should allow for a set-off or counterclaim to the extent of the rectification costs (o)." Omitting the involvement of a third party (m) from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence (q) of complicating the assessment of liability and the apportionment of costs between multiple parties, which could result in unfair outcomes and prolonged litigation. Indeed, the opinion in HIP HING CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. HONG KONG AIRLINES LTD explicitly states that the detailed and contemporaneous evidence regarding the defects and the costs of rectification was crucial to their decision, highlighting the importance of clear and specific evidence in such cases.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HIP HING CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. HONG KONG AIRLINES LTD was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence (u) of parties making unsubstantiated claims for defects and rectification costs, which could lead to unjust enrichment and unfair outcomes. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence (u) occurring because Jessica has provided a specific estimate of £500 for the cost to remedy the defects in Chris's work, and the involvement of a third party (Chris) introduces additional complexities that were not present in the precedent case. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The court should instead focus on the detailed and specific evidence provided by Jessica and the additional complexities introduced by the involvement of a third party.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the detailed and contemporaneous evidence regarding the defects and the costs of rectification (factor m), which was present in the precedent case HIP HING CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. HONG KONG AIRLINES LTD, requiring this factor for all similar cases of a party claiming defects in the work performed and providing sufficient particulars for the cost of rectification (fact pattern i*) would lead to the undesirable consequence of potentially allowing contractors to escape liability for substandard work simply because the aggrieved party could not provide exhaustive documentation. Conversely, not requiring such detailed evidence would allow for a more equitable outcome, ensuring that parties are held accountable for the quality of their work and that aggrieved parties are compensated for the cost of rectification. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which aim to ensure fairness and accountability in contractual relationships.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the detailed and contemporaneous evidence regarding the defects and the costs of rectification (factor m), which was present in HIP HING CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. HONG KONG AIRLINES LTD, we have the additional factor of Jessica engaging a third party (Chris) to complete the work after Lawrence walked off (factor n). This factor n, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of a party claiming defects in the work performed and providing sufficient particulars for the cost of rectification (fact pattern i*), serves a similar function to factor m in the precedent case. Given the presence of factor n, we submit that the reasoning in HIP HING CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. HONG KONG AIRLINES LTD still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as accountability, fairness, and mitigation of loss would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HIP HING CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. HONG KONG AIRLINES LTD, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the issues of contractual obligations and breach, quality of work and defects, particularisation of claims, and mitigation of loss. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the involvement of a third party (Chris) to complete the work after Lawrence walked off, and the lack of detailed and contemporaneous evidence regarding the defects and the costs of rectification.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case suggests that when a party claims defects in the work performed and provides sufficient particulars for the cost of rectification, the court should allow for a set-off or counterclaim to the extent of the rectification costs. This rule is supported by the facts and legal principles involved in both cases, emphasizing accountability for quality of work, fair compensation, encouragement of detailed claims, and mitigation of loss.

However, the broader implications of applying this rule must be considered, especially given the additional complexities introduced by the involvement of a third party in the current case. The absence of detailed and contemporaneous evidence in the current case also complicates the assessment of liability and the apportionment of costs between multiple parties.

Weighing arguments from both sides, particularly the need for detailed evidence to support claims (as emphasized in the precedent) and the importance of holding parties accountable for the quality of their work (as argued in the current case), we conclude that the court should allow Jessica to set-off the £500 cost of rectifying the defects in Chris's work against any amount claimed by Chris. This decision aligns with the principles of fairness and accountability in contractual relationships, ensuring that Jessica is compensated for the additional expenses incurred due to the defects.

Regarding Lawrence's claim for £40,000, it should be scrutinized in light of his breach of contract by walking off the site. Lawrence's breach of contract weakens his position, and any payment should be contingent upon a detailed assessment of the work completed and the costs incurred by Jessica to complete the project.

Luke's claim for £1,000 should be dismissed as he completed the work against Jessica's wishes, which constitutes a breach of the contractual agreement. Jessica is not liable for payment under these circumstances.

Finally, PoTe Ltd's delivery of teapots that do not match the description justifies Jessica's refusal to accept them. The discrepancy in the product's capacity constitutes a breach of the sale of goods contract, and Jessica is within her rights to reject the delivery.

In conclusion, the decision reached balances the need for legal consistency with the principles of fairness and accountability, ensuring that parties are held responsible for their contractual obligations and that aggrieved parties are fairly compensated for their losses.

### Relevant law:

Creatiles Building Materials Co. Ltd. v To's Universe Construction Co. Ltd.

### Major Premise:

1. Creatiles Building Materials Co. Ltd. v To's Universe Construction Co. Ltd.

   Conditions:
   - A party to a contract fails to perform their obligations under the contract
   - The non-performance is not in accordance with the terms of the contract

   Consequences:
   - The non-breaching party may be entitled to treat the non-performance as a repudiation of the contract and terminate the contract

   Exceptions:
   - The non-performance does not go to the root of the contract
   - The non-performance is a bona fide misconstruction of the terms of the contract

### Minor Premise:

1. Creatiles Building Materials Co. Ltd. v To's Universe Construction Co. Ltd.:
- Chris was engaged by Jessica to complete the work on the teashop.
- Jessica claims the work done by Chris is shoddy, with specific defects such as the doors to the kitchen opening inwards instead of outwards and the shop counter sloping.
- The cost to remedy the defects is £500.

   Conditions:
   - Chris, a party to the contract, has failed to perform his obligations under the contract by delivering shoddy work.
   - The non-performance (shoddy work) is not in accordance with the terms of the contract, which presumably required a certain standard of workmanship.

   Consequences:
   - Jessica may be entitled to treat the non-performance as a repudiation of the contract and terminate the contract.

   Exceptions:
   - The non-performance (shoddy work) does not go to the root of the contract, as the defects are relatively minor and can be remedied at a cost of £500.
   - There is no indication that the non-performance is a bona fide misconstruction of the terms of the contract.

### Conclusion:

The non-performance by Chris does not go to the root of the contract, as the defects are minor and can be remedied at a cost of £500. Therefore, Jessica cannot refuse to pay Chris due to the alleged defects in the work.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA2675/2001)
In the case of HCA2675/2001 BETWEEN PHAROS COMPANY LIMITED Plaintiff and HILLCO LIMITED trading as ERICKSON & ASSOCIATES DESIGN CONSULTANTS Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to the balance of the contract price for the work completed, subject to a reduction for proven defects. The defendant was entitled to damages for the cost of rectifying specific defects and time wasted due to those defects, but not for unproven claims or speculative losses.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA2675/2001 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Contractual Obligations and Completion**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA2675/2001, the plaintiff completed the work but there were defects. In our current case, Lawrence completed part of the work but left the project incomplete.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Defects in Workmanship**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA2675/2001, the defendant claimed defects in the work (e.g., gaps in metal panels, unstable bar counter). In our current case, Jessica claims defects in Chris's work (e.g., doors opening inwards, sloping shop counter).

- **Legal Concept 3: Acceptance and Rectification of Defects**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA2675/2001, the court considered whether the defects were accepted as part of the completed work and whether they were rectifiable. In our current case, Jessica has identified specific defects and the cost to remedy them.

- **Legal Concept 4: Damages and Set-Offs**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCA2675/2001, the court allowed for damages to be set off against the contract price for proven defects. In our current case, Jessica may seek to set off the cost of rectifying defects against the payment due to Chris.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA2675/2001)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern involving completion of work with defects, the court should decide that the party responsible for the defects is liable for the cost of rectifying those defects, and the other party may set off these costs against the contract price. This rule was justified in HCA2675/2001 because it balanced the interests of both parties: ensuring that the party who completed the work is compensated for their efforts while also holding them accountable for any defects, thereby protecting the other party from bearing the cost of substandard workmanship. This approach promotes fairness and encourages adherence to contractual standards.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA2675/2001) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Contractual Obligations and Completion**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA2675/2001, the plaintiff completed the work but there were defects. In our current case, Lawrence completed part of the work but left the project incomplete. Lawrence is claiming £40,000 for the work done on the residential part of the project.

- **Legal Concept 2: Defects in Workmanship**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA2675/2001, the defendant claimed defects in the work (e.g., gaps in metal panels, unstable bar counter). In our current case, Jessica claims defects in Chris's work (e.g., doors opening inwards, sloping shop counter).

- **Legal Concept 3: Acceptance and Rectification of Defects**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA2675/2001, the court considered whether the defects were accepted as part of the completed work and whether they were rectifiable. In our current case, Jessica has identified specific defects and the cost to remedy them is £500.

- **Legal Concept 4: Damages and Set-Offs**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCA2675/2001, the court allowed for damages to be set off against the contract price for proven defects. In our current case, Jessica may seek to set off the cost of rectifying defects against the payment due to Chris.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA2675/2001, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Fair Compensation**: Ensuring that Lawrence and Chris are compensated for their efforts while holding them accountable for any defects or incomplete work. This promotes fairness and encourages adherence to contractual standards.
   
2. **Encouragement of Quality Workmanship**: By allowing Jessica to set off the cost of rectifying defects against the payment due, it incentivizes contractors to ensure high-quality workmanship and complete their contractual obligations.

3. **Protection of the Non-Breaching Party**: Protecting Jessica from bearing the cost of substandard workmanship and incomplete work, thereby ensuring that she receives the value she contracted for.

4. **Legal Consistency**: Applying the same legal principles consistently across similar cases promotes predictability and stability in the law, which is a fundamental principle of the common law system.

Therefore, based on the precedent set in HCA2675/2001, Jessica should be entitled to set off the cost of rectifying the defects (£500) against the payment due to Chris. Additionally, Lawrence's claim for £40,000 should be evaluated based on the work completed and any potential set-offs for the incomplete portion of the project. Luke's claim for £1,000 should be dismissed as he completed the work against Jessica's wishes, and PoTe Ltd should not be entitled to payment as the teapots delivered did not match the description on the order form.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA2675/2001, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of contemporaneous documents and photographic evidence that supported the claims of defects and the costs associated with rectifying them. This evidence was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—such as fair compensation for completed work and accountability for defects—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided a clear and objective basis for the court's findings.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of contemporaneous documents and photographic evidence is notably absent. Jessica's claims regarding the defects in Chris's work (e.g., doors opening inwards, sloping shop counter) are not supported by any such objective evidence. This absence makes it more challenging to substantiate the claims of defects and the associated costs, thereby weakening the justification for setting off the cost of rectifying the defects against the payment due to Chris.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in HCA2675/2001: the issue of a contractor (Lawrence) abandoning the project before its completion. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces the complication of an incomplete contract and the need to engage another contractor (Chris) to finish the work.

Due to Lawrence's abandonment of the project, applying the same outcome as in HCA2675/2001 would have more negative consequences, such as unfairly penalizing Jessica for the additional costs and inconvenience caused by Lawrence's breach of contract. Unlike in HCA2675/2001, where the work was completed (albeit with defects), the incomplete nature of Lawrence's work and the subsequent engagement of Chris to finish the project introduce additional layers of complexity and potential financial burden on Jessica. This distinction necessitates a different approach to ensure a fair and equitable resolution.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA2675/2001 should be stated as "When both [i*] (completion of work with defects) and [m] (absence of contemporaneous documents and photographic evidence) are present, the court should decide [o] (the party responsible for the defects is liable for the cost of rectifying those defects, and the other party may set off these costs against the contract price) only if there is sufficient objective evidence to substantiate the claims of defects and associated costs." Omitting [m] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q] (unfairly penalizing the contractor for unproven defects and speculative costs, leading to potential abuse of the set-off mechanism by the other party). Indeed, the opinion in HCA2675/2001 explicitly states that the presence of contemporaneous documents and photographic evidence was crucial to their decision, as it provided a clear and objective basis for the court's findings.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA2675/2001 was clearly designed to prevent [undesirable consequence u] (unjust enrichment of the party claiming defects without sufficient proof, thereby ensuring that claims for defects and associated costs are substantiated by objective evidence). However, in our current case, there's no risk of [u] occurring because the absence of contemporaneous documents and photographic evidence means that Jessica's claims regarding the defects in Chris's work are not substantiated by objective evidence. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the contemporaneous documents and photographic evidence (factor m), which was present in the precedent case HCA2675/2001, requiring this factor for all similar cases of completion of work with defects (fact pattern i*) would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would unfairly penalize parties who have legitimate claims of defects but lack the means to provide such evidence, potentially due to the nature of the defects or the timing of their discovery. Conversely, not requiring contemporaneous documents and photographic evidence would allow for a more equitable consideration of claims based on the overall credibility of the parties and the reasonableness of the claimed defects and associated costs. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which aim to ensure fairness and justice in the enforcement of contractual obligations and the rectification of breaches.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the contemporaneous documents and photographic evidence (factor m), which was present in HCA2675/2001, we have the additional factor of Lawrence abandoning the project before its completion (factor n). This factor n, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of completion of work with defects (fact pattern i*), serves a similar function to factor m in the precedent case. Given the presence of factor n, we submit that the reasoning in HCA2675/2001 still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values—such as ensuring fair compensation, encouraging quality workmanship, and protecting the non-breaching party—would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. The abandonment of the project by Lawrence introduces a clear breach of contract, which justifies a more flexible approach in evaluating Jessica's claims and set-offs, even in the absence of contemporaneous documents and photographic evidence.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA2675/2001, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of defects in the completed work and the issue of contractual obligations and completion. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of contemporaneous documents and photographic evidence in the current case and the fact that Lawrence abandoned the project before its completion.

The proposed legal rule from HCA2675/2001, which allows for the cost of rectifying defects to be set off against the contract price, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the absence of objective evidence in the current case and the additional complexity introduced by Lawrence's abandonment of the project.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of ensuring fair compensation and accountability for defects (as argued in the initial analogy) and the need for objective evidence to substantiate claims of defects and associated costs (as highlighted in the rebuttal arguments). Additionally, the surrebuttal arguments emphasize the need for flexibility in evaluating claims when a contractor abandons a project, even in the absence of contemporaneous evidence.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, justice, and the enforcement of contractual obligations, we conclude that Jessica should be entitled to set off the cost of rectifying the defects (£500) against the payment due to Chris. This decision aligns with the precedent set in HCA2675/2001, ensuring that contractors are held accountable for defects while also protecting the non-breaching party from bearing the cost of substandard workmanship.

Regarding Lawrence's claim for £40,000, it should be evaluated based on the work completed and any potential set-offs for the incomplete portion of the project. Given that Lawrence abandoned the project, Jessica should be entitled to a reduction in the amount claimed to account for the additional costs and inconvenience caused by the breach of contract.

Luke's claim for £1,000 should be dismissed as he completed the work against Jessica's wishes, and PoTe Ltd should not be entitled to payment as the teapots delivered did not match the description on the order form.

In conclusion, the decision reached balances the need for legal consistency with the principles of fairness and justice, ensuring that all parties are held accountable for their contractual obligations while protecting the interests of the non-breaching party.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCCT 3/2010 BETWEEN HONG KONG (SAR) HOTEL LIMITED Plaintiff and WING KEY CONSTRUCTION COMPANY LIMITED Defendant)
In the case of HCCT 3/2010 BETWEEN HONG KONG (SAR) HOTEL LIMITED Plaintiff and WING KEY CONSTRUCTION COMPANY LIMITED Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the defendant's failure to rectify safety irregularities constituted a breach of contract. The court found that the term "defective work" included temporary works and that the defendant's refusal or persistent neglect to rectify these defects materially affected the works, justifying the determination of the contract.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCCT 3/2010 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Definition of Defective Work**: In both cases, the term "defective work" is central to the dispute.
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCCT 3/2010, the court considered whether temporary safety works fell under the definition of "defective work." In the current case, the issue is whether the shoddy work by Chris, such as the inward-opening kitchen doors and sloping shop counter, constitutes "defective work."
- **Legal Concept 2: Obligation to Rectify Defective Work**: Both cases involve the obligation of the contractor to rectify defective work.
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCCT 3/2010, the defendant was required to rectify safety irregularities. In the current case, Chris's work has defects that need rectification.
- **Legal Concept 3: Material Effect on the Works**: The material effect of the defective work on the overall project is a key consideration.
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCCT 3/2010, the court found that the safety irregularities materially affected the works. In the current case, the defects in Chris's work, such as the kitchen doors and shop counter, affect the usability and safety of the teashop.
- **Legal Concept 4: Reasonableness of Determination**: The reasonableness of the actions taken in response to the defective work is examined.
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCCT 3/2010, the court considered whether the determination of the contract was reasonable. In the current case, the reasonableness of Jessica's refusal to pay Chris due to the defects is in question.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCCT 3/2010)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of defective work that materially affects the project and the contractor's refusal or neglect to rectify it, the court should decide that the contractor is in breach of contract. This rule was justified in HCCT 3/2010 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that contractors adhere to their obligations and maintain safety and quality standards outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially harsh consequences for contractors who fail to meet these standards.

Applying this rule to the current case, Chris's shoddy work, which includes the inward-opening kitchen doors and sloping shop counter, constitutes defective work that materially affects the usability and safety of the teashop. Therefore, Jessica's refusal to pay Chris is justified, and Chris is in breach of contract for failing to rectify these defects.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCCT 3/2010 BETWEEN HONG KONG (SAR) HOTEL LIMITED Plaintiff and WING KEY CONSTRUCTION COMPANY LIMITED Defendant) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Definition of Defective Work**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCCT 3/2010, the court considered whether temporary safety works fell under the definition of "defective work." In the current case, the issue is whether the shoddy work by Chris, such as the inward-opening kitchen doors and sloping shop counter, constitutes "defective work."

- **Legal Concept 2: Obligation to Rectify Defective Work**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCCT 3/2010, the defendant was required to rectify safety irregularities. In the current case, Chris's work has defects that need rectification.

- **Legal Concept 3: Material Effect on the Works**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCCT 3/2010, the court found that the safety irregularities materially affected the works. In the current case, the defects in Chris's work, such as the kitchen doors and shop counter, affect the usability and safety of the teashop.

- **Legal Concept 4: Reasonableness of Determination**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCCT 3/2010, the court considered whether the determination of the contract was reasonable. In the current case, the reasonableness of Jessica's refusal to pay Chris due to the defects is in question.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCCT 3/2010, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Contractor Accountability**: Just as in HCCT 3/2010, holding Chris accountable for the defective work ensures that contractors adhere to their obligations and maintain quality standards. This promotes a higher standard of workmanship and reliability in the construction industry.

2. **Protecting the Client's Interests**: By recognizing the defects as a breach of contract, the court would protect Jessica's interests, ensuring she receives the quality of work she contracted for. This aligns with the principle that clients should not bear the burden of rectifying substandard work.

3. **Safety and Usability**: The defects in Chris's work, such as the inward-opening kitchen doors and sloping shop counter, pose safety and usability issues. Addressing these defects is crucial for the safe and effective operation of the teashop, similar to the safety concerns in HCCT 3/2010.

4. **Fairness in Contractual Obligations**: The court's decision would reinforce the importance of fairness in contractual obligations, ensuring that contractors cannot evade their responsibilities by providing substandard work and then demanding payment.

Therefore, applying the rule from HCCT 3/2010 to the current case, Chris's shoddy work constitutes defective work that materially affects the usability and safety of the teashop. Jessica's refusal to pay Chris is justified, and Chris is in breach of contract for failing to rectify these defects. This decision would uphold the underlying values of accountability, client protection, safety, and fairness in contractual relationships.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCCT 3/2010 BETWEEN HONG KONG (SAR) HOTEL LIMITED Plaintiff and WING KEY CONSTRUCTION COMPANY LIMITED Defendant, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of safety irregularities that posed immediate and serious risks to life and property. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—ensuring contractor accountability and maintaining safety standards—outweighed any potential drawbacks because the safety of workers and the public was at stake. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of immediate safety risk is notably absent. The defects in Chris's work, such as the inward-opening kitchen doors and the sloping shop counter, while problematic, do not pose the same level of immediate danger to life and property as the safety irregularities in the precedent case.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in HCCT 3/2010 BETWEEN HONG KONG (SAR) HOTEL LIMITED Plaintiff and WING KEY CONSTRUCTION COMPANY LIMITED Defendant. This factor is the completion of the residential part of the project by Lawrence and his subsequent claim for £40,000 for the work done. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces a partial performance and payment issue that was not present in the precedent case. Due to this factor, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as unjust enrichment of Jessica if she refuses to pay for the completed residential work, than positive ones. Unlike in HCCT 3/2010, where the focus was on unrectified safety defects, our case involves a scenario where part of the work has been satisfactorily completed, and the contractor is seeking payment for that portion. This changes the balance of positive and negative effects, making it necessary to consider partial payment for the completed work while addressing the defects in the teashop separately.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCCT 3/2010 BETWEEN HONG KONG (SAR) HOTEL LIMITED Plaintiff and WING KEY CONSTRUCTION COMPANY LIMITED Defendant should be stated as: "When both [defective work that materially affects the project] and [immediate safety risks] are present, the court should decide [the contractor is in breach of contract and the client is justified in refusing payment]." Omitting [immediate safety risks] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of clients refusing to pay for minor defects that do not pose significant risks, thereby unfairly penalizing contractors for issues that could be easily rectified]. Indeed, the opinion in HCCT 3/2010 explicitly states that the safety irregularities were crucial to their decision, as they posed immediate and serious risks to life and property.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCCT 3/2010 was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of contractors neglecting safety measures, thereby endangering workers and the public]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [immediate safety risks occurring]. The defects in Chris's work, such as the inward-opening kitchen doors and the sloping shop counter, while problematic, do not pose the same level of immediate danger to life and property as the safety irregularities in the precedent case. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should consider the defects as minor issues that can be rectified, and Jessica should be required to pay Chris, possibly deducting the cost of rectifying the defects.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the immediate safety risks, which were present in the precedent case HCCT 3/2010 BETWEEN HONG KONG (SAR) HOTEL LIMITED Plaintiff and WING KEY CONSTRUCTION COMPANY LIMITED Defendant, requiring this factor for all similar cases of defective work that materially affects the project would lead to the undesirable consequence of allowing contractors to evade responsibility for substandard work that, while not immediately dangerous, still significantly impacts the usability and quality of the project. Conversely, not requiring immediate safety risks would allow for a more comprehensive enforcement of contractual obligations, ensuring that all aspects of the work, whether temporary or permanent, meet the agreed-upon standards. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which aim to ensure that parties fulfill their contractual duties and that clients receive the quality of work they have paid for.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the immediate safety risks, which were present in HCCT 3/2010 BETWEEN HONG KONG (SAR) HOTEL LIMITED Plaintiff and WING KEY CONSTRUCTION COMPANY LIMITED Defendant, we have the additional factor of partial performance by Lawrence, who completed the residential part of the project and is seeking payment for that portion. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of defective work that materially affects the project, serves a similar function to the immediate safety risks in the precedent case. Given the presence of partial performance, we submit that the reasoning in HCCT 3/2010 still applies, as the positive effects on ensuring contractor accountability and protecting the client's interests would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. Therefore, Jessica should be required to pay Lawrence for the completed residential work, while addressing the defects in the teashop separately.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCCT 3/2010 BETWEEN HONG KONG (SAR) HOTEL LIMITED Plaintiff and WING KEY CONSTRUCTION COMPANY LIMITED Defendant, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the definition of defective work, the obligation to rectify defective work, the material effect on the works, and the reasonableness of the determination. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of immediate safety risks and the presence of partial performance by Lawrence.

The proposed legal rule from HCCT 3/2010, which states that defective work that materially affects the project and the contractor's refusal or neglect to rectify it constitutes a breach of contract, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in the context of minor defects and partial performance.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that immediate safety risks were crucial in the precedent case and the counterargument that partial performance by Lawrence introduces a new factor that must be considered. Additionally, the argument that requiring immediate safety risks for all similar cases would allow contractors to evade responsibility for substandard work is compelling.

Considering the underlying legal principles of ensuring contractor accountability, protecting the client's interests, and maintaining safety and quality standards, we conclude that:

1. **Lawrence**: Jessica should be required to pay Lawrence for the completed residential work, as partial performance has been satisfactorily completed. Lawrence's claim for £40,000 is justified, and Jessica's refusal to pay would result in unjust enrichment.

2. **Chris**: The defects in Chris's work, such as the inward-opening kitchen doors and the sloping shop counter, constitute defective work that materially affects the usability and safety of the teashop. Jessica's refusal to pay Chris is justified, and Chris is in breach of contract for failing to rectify these defects. However, Jessica should deduct the cost of rectifying the defects (£500) from the payment owed to Chris.

3. **Luke**: Luke's decision to complete the work despite Jessica's cancellation of the contract is not justified. Jessica is not liable to pay Luke the £1,000, as the contract was validly terminated before completion.

4. **PoTe Ltd**: The teapots delivered by PoTe Ltd do not match the description on the website or order form, as they have a 1.3-litre capacity instead of the specified 1.2 litres. Jessica's refusal to accept delivery is justified, and she is not liable for the teapots.

In conclusion, the decision reached balances the considerations of legal precedent, justice, and legal consistency. The key factors influencing the outcome include the partial performance by Lawrence, the material effect of Chris's defective work, the valid termination of Luke's contract, and the non-conformity of PoTe Ltd's teapots. This decision ensures that contractual obligations are upheld while protecting the interests of all parties involved.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS)
In the case of SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS (precedent p), the court dealt with claims made by the contractor for outstanding costs of works carried out and counterclaims by the owners for damages due to allegedly defective works. The court ruled that expert evidence must be properly adduced with the court's leave and that any expert opinion evidence is inadmissible unless it complies with the relevant provisions and directions of the court. The court emphasized the importance of expert directions being sought from the court as part of the case management process to ensure fairness and mutuality.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Contractual Obligations and Performance**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, there is a dispute over the completion and quality of contracted work. In the precedent case, the contractor allegedly failed to complete the works and performed defective work. In the current case, Lawrence did not complete the work on the teashop, and Chris's work on the teashop is claimed to be shoddy.

- **Legal Concept 2: Expert Evidence and Admissibility**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: The precedent case involved the admissibility of expert evidence to determine the extent and quality of the work done. In the current case, Jessica may need to rely on expert evidence to substantiate her claims about the defects in Chris's work.

- **Legal Concept 3: Remedies for Defective Work**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In the precedent case, the owners sought damages for defective work. In the current case, Jessica seeks to remedy the defects in Chris's work and may claim damages or a price reduction.

- **Legal Concept 4: Contractual Payment Disputes**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: Both cases involve disputes over payment for work done. In the precedent case, the contractor claimed outstanding costs, while in the current case, Lawrence claims payment for the work completed on the private residence, and Chris may claim payment for the work on the teashop.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS)
This suggests a general rule that when we see fact pattern i* (disputes over the completion and quality of contracted work, the need for expert evidence to determine the extent and quality of work, and claims for remedies for defective work), the court should decide that expert evidence must be properly adduced with the court's leave and that any expert opinion evidence is inadmissible unless it complies with the relevant provisions and directions of the court. This rule was justified in SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS because ensuring the proper adduction of expert evidence promotes fairness and mutuality in resolving disputes, which aligns with the underlying values and principles of the law.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Contractual Obligations and Performance**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, there is a dispute over the completion and quality of contracted work. Lawrence did not complete the work on the teashop, and Chris's work on the teashop is claimed to be shoddy.

- **Legal Concept 2: Expert Evidence and Admissibility**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: The precedent case involved the admissibility of expert evidence to determine the extent and quality of the work done. In the current case, Jessica may need to rely on expert evidence to substantiate her claims about the defects in Chris's work.

- **Legal Concept 3: Remedies for Defective Work**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In the precedent case, the owners sought damages for defective work. In the current case, Jessica seeks to remedy the defects in Chris's work and may claim damages or a price reduction.

- **Legal Concept 4: Contractual Payment Disputes**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: Both cases involve disputes over payment for work done. Lawrence claims payment for the work completed on the private residence, and Chris may claim payment for the work on the teashop.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Fairness and Mutuality**: By requiring that expert evidence be properly adduced with the court's leave, the court ensures that both parties have a fair opportunity to present their case and that the evidence is reliable and relevant. This promotes mutuality and fairness in the resolution of disputes.

2. **Promoting Efficient Case Management**: Properly managing expert evidence as part of the case management process helps narrow down disputes to core issues, minimizing costs and time. This aligns with the objectives set out in Order 1A rule 1 RHC, which aims to ensure that cases are dealt with justly and efficiently.

3. **Upholding the Integrity of Expert Evidence**: By adhering to the rules and directions for expert evidence, the court maintains the integrity and reliability of expert testimony. This is crucial for making informed and just decisions based on specialized knowledge and expertise.

4. **Providing Clear Guidance for Future Cases**: Consistently applying the rule that expert evidence must be properly adduced with the court's leave provides clear guidance for future cases. This helps parties understand the importance of following procedural rules and ensures consistency in judicial decisions.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS, it would have the positive effects of ensuring fairness, promoting efficient case management, upholding the integrity of expert evidence, and providing clear guidance for future cases.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of expert evidence that was properly adduced with the court's leave. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as fairness, efficient case management, and the integrity of expert evidence, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it allowed the court to rely on reliable and relevant expert testimony to make an informed decision. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of properly adduced expert evidence is notably absent as there is no indication that Jessica has sought or obtained the court's leave to adduce expert evidence to substantiate her claims about the defects in Chris's work.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the presence of multiple contractual disputes involving different parties (Lawrence, Chris, Luke, and PoTe Ltd.), that was not present in SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces a complexity of multiple overlapping contractual obligations and potential breaches. Due to this complexity, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as increased litigation costs and potential inconsistencies in resolving the disputes, than positive ones, unlike in SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS. This is because each contractual dispute may require separate consideration and resolution, which complicates the application of a single legal rule derived from the precedent case.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS** should be stated as: "When both [disputes over the completion and quality of contracted work, the need for expert evidence to determine the extent and quality of work, and claims for remedies for defective work] and [the presence of properly adduced expert evidence with the court's leave] are present, the court should decide that expert evidence must be properly adduced with the court's leave and that any expert opinion evidence is inadmissible unless it complies with the relevant provisions and directions of the court." Omitting [the presence of properly adduced expert evidence with the court's leave] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q], such as the court relying on unreliable or irrelevant expert testimony, which could result in unfair or unjust decisions. Indeed, the opinion in **SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS** explicitly states that [the presence of properly adduced expert evidence with the court's leave] was crucial to their decision, as it ensures fairness and mutuality in resolving disputes.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS** was clearly designed to prevent [undesirable consequence u], which is the court relying on unreliable or irrelevant expert testimony, leading to unfair or unjust decisions. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [u] occurring because Jessica has not sought or obtained the court's leave to adduce expert evidence to substantiate her claims about the defects in Chris's work. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The absence of properly adduced expert evidence means that the court would not be at risk of relying on unreliable or irrelevant expert testimony, and thus, the rule from the precedent case should not apply.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the presence of properly adduced expert evidence with the court's leave, which was present in the precedent case SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS, requiring this factor for all similar cases of disputes over the completion and quality of contracted work, the need for expert evidence to determine the extent and quality of work, and claims for remedies for defective work would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would impose an unnecessary procedural burden on parties, potentially delaying the resolution of disputes and increasing litigation costs. Conversely, not requiring the presence of properly adduced expert evidence with the court's leave would allow for a more streamlined and efficient resolution of disputes, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, such as promoting access to justice and ensuring that disputes are resolved in a timely and cost-effective manner.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the presence of properly adduced expert evidence with the court's leave, which was present in SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS, we have the additional factor of multiple overlapping contractual disputes involving different parties (Lawrence, Chris, Luke, and PoTe Ltd.). This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of disputes over the completion and quality of contracted work, the need for expert evidence to determine the extent and quality of work, and claims for remedies for defective work, serves a similar function to the presence of properly adduced expert evidence with the court's leave in the precedent case. Given the presence of multiple overlapping contractual disputes, we submit that the reasoning in SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as ensuring fairness and mutuality, promoting efficient case management, and upholding the integrity of expert evidence, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations:

**Key Similarities:**
1. **Disputes over Completion and Quality of Contracted Work:** Both cases involve disputes regarding the completion and quality of contracted work.
2. **Need for Expert Evidence:** Both cases highlight the necessity of expert evidence to determine the extent and quality of the work done.
3. **Claims for Remedies for Defective Work:** Both cases involve claims for remedies due to defective work.

**Key Differences:**
1. **Presence of Properly Adduced Expert Evidence:** In the precedent case, expert evidence was properly adduced with the court's leave, whereas in the current case, there is no indication that Jessica has sought or obtained the court's leave to adduce expert evidence.
2. **Multiple Overlapping Contractual Disputes:** The current case involves multiple overlapping contractual disputes with different parties (Lawrence, Chris, Luke, and PoTe Ltd.), adding complexity not present in the precedent case.

**Proposed Legal Rule:**
The rule from the precedent case suggests that expert evidence must be properly adduced with the court's leave and that any expert opinion evidence is inadmissible unless it complies with the relevant provisions and directions of the court.

**Weighing Arguments:**
- **For Applying the Rule:** Ensuring that expert evidence is properly adduced promotes fairness, mutuality, and efficient case management. It upholds the integrity of expert testimony and provides clear guidance for future cases.
- **Against Applying the Rule:** Imposing the requirement of properly adduced expert evidence in all similar cases could lead to unnecessary procedural burdens, delaying dispute resolution and increasing litigation costs. The presence of multiple overlapping contractual disputes in the current case complicates the application of a single legal rule derived from the precedent case.

**Conclusion:**
Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, mutuality, efficient case management, and the integrity of expert evidence, we conclude that the rule from **SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS** should be applied with some flexibility in the current case. Specifically, while Jessica should ideally seek the court's leave to adduce expert evidence to substantiate her claims about the defects in Chris's work, the court should also consider the practicalities and complexities introduced by the multiple overlapping contractual disputes.

Therefore, the court should:
1. Allow Jessica to present her claims regarding the defects in Chris's work, potentially with expert evidence, but without strictly requiring prior leave, given the complexity of the case.
2. Ensure that any expert evidence presented is scrutinized for reliability and relevance, even if not formally adduced with prior leave.
3. Address the multiple contractual disputes individually, ensuring that each party's claims and defenses are fairly considered.

This approach balances the need for procedural rigor with the practicalities of resolving complex, multi-party disputes efficiently and justly.

- The circumstances giving rise to the frustration of the contract (Jessica's cancellation) do not involve any sums payable under a contract of insurance.

### Conclusion:

Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3 applies. Luke is entitled to recover a sum from Jessica, not exceeding the value of the benefit obtained by Jessica, as the court considers just, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the expenses incurred by Luke. Therefore, Luke is likely entitled to some compensation for the work done prior to cancellation.

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 15 Subsection 1

### Major Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 15 Subsection 1
   
   Conditions:
   - There is a contract for the sale of goods by description.
   - The goods do not correspond with the description.

   Consequences:
   - There is an implied condition that the goods shall correspond with the description.

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 15 Subsection 1:
- Jessica has entered into a contract with PoTe Ltd for the sale of teapots by description.
- The description specified that the teapots should have a 1.2 litre capacity.
- The teapots delivered by PoTe Ltd have a 1.3 litre capacity, which does not correspond with the description.

### Conclusion:

Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 15 Subsection 1 applies, and there is an implied condition that the goods (teapots) shall correspond with the description. Since the teapots delivered do not match the description, Jessica is entitled to refuse acceptance of the delivery.

## Deductive Reasoning: ca

### Relevant law:

CACV 185/2015 Lee Yuk Shing v Dianoor International Limited  
CACV 240/98 Samsung Hong Kong Limited v Keen Time Trading Limited

### Major Premise:

1. CACV 185/2015 Lee Yuk Shing v Dianoor International Limited

   Conditions:
   - The sale is of specific goods
   - The goods are described in the contract
   - The description constitutes a substantial ingredient in the identity of the thing sold
   - There is reliance by the purchaser on the description

   Consequences:
   - The contract is considered a sale by description
   - The goods must correspond with the description

   Exceptions:
   - The description does not constitute a substantial ingredient in the identity of the thing sold
   - There is no reliance by the purchaser on the description

2. CACV 240/98 Samsung Hong Kong Limited v Keen Time Trading Limited

   Conditions:
   - The goods delivered do not correspond with the description in the contract

   Consequences:
   - The buyer is entitled to reject the goods

   Exceptions:
   - There is an express or implied term in the contract or a trade practice or custom that allows for a margin of tolerance

### Minor Premise:

1. CACV 185/2015 Lee Yuk Shing v Dianoor International Limited:
- The sale is of specific goods (60 teapots with basket infusers).
- The goods are described in the contract (1.2 litre capacity teapots).
- The description constitutes a substantial ingredient in the identity of the thing sold (capacity of the teapots is a key feature).
- There is reliance by the purchaser on the description (Jessica ordered based on the 1.2 litre capacity).

   Therefore, the contract is considered a sale by description, and the goods must correspond with the description.

2. CACV 240/98 Samsung Hong Kong Limited v Keen Time Trading Limited:
- The goods delivered (1.3 litre capacity teapots) do not correspond with the description in the contract (1.2 litre capacity teapots).

   Therefore, the buyer (Jessica) is entitled to reject the goods.

   There is no indication of an express or implied term in the contract or a trade practice or custom that allows for a margin of tolerance in this scenario.

### Conclusion:

Jessica is entitled to reject the teapots delivered by PoTe Ltd as they do not correspond with the description in the contract.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA001178/1998 BETWEEN P & M INDUSTRIAL COMPANY LIMITED Plaintiff AND WINNER BOB (H.K.) COMPANY LIMITED Defendant)
In the case of HCA001178/1998 BETWEEN P & M INDUSTRIAL COMPANY LIMITED Plaintiff AND WINNER BOB (H.K.) COMPANY LIMITED Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the fabric delivered by the defendant did not conform to the approved samples, and the plaintiff was entitled to reject the fabric and claim damages. The court found that the colour differences between the shipment samples and the approved lap-dip samples were beyond the commercially accepted tolerance level, and the defendant was aware of this discrepancy. The court also held that the plaintiff's act of returning the bill of lading amounted to a rejection of the fabric, thereby bringing the contract to an end.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA001178/1998 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Conformity to Contractual Description**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA001178/1998, the fabric did not conform to the approved lap-dip samples. In our current case, the teapots delivered by PoTe Ltd do not match the description of having a 1.2 litre capacity as specified in the contract.
- **Legal Concept 2: Right to Reject Non-Conforming Goods**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA001178/1998, the plaintiff was entitled to reject the fabric due to non-conformity. In our current case, Jessica may have the right to reject the teapots due to their non-conformity with the contractual description.
- **Legal Concept 3: Implied Conditions in Sale of Goods**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA001178/1998, the court referred to the implied condition that goods must conform to the sample in a sale by sample. In our current case, there is an implied condition under the Sale of Goods Ordinance that the goods must match the description provided in the contract.
- **Legal Concept 4: Remedies for Breach of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCA001178/1998, the plaintiff was entitled to claim damages for the breach of contract. In our current case, Jessica may be entitled to claim damages or seek other remedies for the breach of contract by PoTe Ltd.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA001178/1998)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern where goods delivered do not conform to the contractual description, the court should decide that the buyer is entitled to reject the goods and claim damages. This rule was justified in HCA001178/1998 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that sellers adhere to the contractual descriptions and maintaining the integrity of commercial transactions outweigh the negative effects (E-) of allowing buyers to reject goods and claim damages. This rule upholds the underlying values of fairness and reliability in contractual dealings.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA001178/1998 BETWEEN P & M INDUSTRIAL COMPANY LIMITED Plaintiff AND WINNER BOB (H.K.) COMPANY LIMITED Defendant) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Conformity to Contractual Description**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA001178/1998, the fabric did not conform to the approved lap-dip samples. In our current case, the teapots delivered by PoTe Ltd do not match the description of having a 1.2 litre capacity as specified in the contract.

- **Legal Concept 2: Right to Reject Non-Conforming Goods**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA001178/1998, the plaintiff was entitled to reject the fabric due to non-conformity. In our current case, Jessica may have the right to reject the teapots due to their non-conformity with the contractual description.

- **Legal Concept 3: Implied Conditions in Sale of Goods**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA001178/1998, the court referred to the implied condition that goods must conform to the sample in a sale by sample. In our current case, there is an implied condition under the Sale of Goods Ordinance that the goods must match the description provided in the contract.

- **Legal Concept 4: Remedies for Breach of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCA001178/1998, the plaintiff was entitled to claim damages for the breach of contract. In our current case, Jessica may be entitled to claim damages or seek other remedies for the breach of contract by PoTe Ltd.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA001178/1998, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Adherence to Contractual Descriptions**: Upholding the right to reject non-conforming goods reinforces the importance of sellers adhering to the descriptions provided in contracts. This maintains the integrity and reliability of commercial transactions.

2. **Fairness in Commercial Dealings**: Allowing Jessica to reject the teapots and claim damages ensures fairness in the transaction. It prevents sellers from delivering goods that do not meet the agreed specifications and protects buyers from receiving substandard products.

3. **Encouraging Compliance with Contractual Obligations**: By holding sellers accountable for delivering goods that conform to contractual descriptions, the court promotes compliance with contractual obligations. This encourages better business practices and reduces the likelihood of disputes arising from non-conforming goods.

4. **Providing Effective Remedies for Breach of Contract**: Granting Jessica the right to reject the teapots and claim damages provides an effective remedy for the breach of contract. It ensures that buyers are compensated for any losses incurred due to the seller's failure to deliver goods as specified.

Therefore, given the shared fact patterns and the positive effects on the underlying values and principles of the law, the court should reach the same outcome as in HCA001178/1998. Jessica should be entitled to reject the teapots delivered by PoTe Ltd and claim damages for any losses incurred due to the non-conformity of the goods.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, namely the issue of **shoddy workmanship** by Chris, which was not present in HCA001178/1998 BETWEEN P & M INDUSTRIAL COMPANY LIMITED Plaintiff AND WINNER BOB (H.K.) COMPANY LIMITED Defendant. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of non-conformity to contractual description because it introduces an additional layer of complexity regarding the quality of performance and the associated remedies.

Due to the shoddy workmanship by Chris, applying the same outcome (i.e., the right to reject and claim damages) in our case would have more negative consequences such as potential disputes over the extent and nature of the defects, the cost of rectification, and the overall impact on the project's completion timeline. Unlike in HCA001178/1998, where the non-conformity was clear-cut and quantifiable (colour differences in fabric), the current case involves subjective assessments of workmanship quality and the practicality of rectifying defects.

Therefore, the presence of this factor (shoddy workmanship) necessitates a different approach to resolving the dispute, potentially involving an assessment of the reasonableness of the rectification costs and the impact on the overall project, rather than a straightforward rejection and claim for damages.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA001178/1998 BETWEEN P & M INDUSTRIAL COMPANY LIMITED Plaintiff AND WINNER BOB (H.K.) COMPANY LIMITED Defendant should be stated as: "When both non-conformity to contractual description (i*) and shoddy workmanship (m) are present, the court should decide that the buyer is entitled to reject the goods and claim damages, but the court should also consider the reasonableness of the rectification costs and the impact on the overall project." Omitting the factor of shoddy workmanship (m) from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence (q) of buyers being able to reject goods and claim damages without addressing the practicalities and complexities of rectifying defects, which could result in prolonged disputes and unfair outcomes. Indeed, the opinion in HCA001178/1998 explicitly states that the non-conformity was clear-cut and quantifiable, which was crucial to their decision. In our current case, the presence of shoddy workmanship introduces additional considerations that must be addressed to ensure a fair and practical resolution.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA001178/1998 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence (u) of sellers delivering goods that do not conform to the contractual description and buyers being left without an effective remedy. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence occurring because the issue is not just about non-conformity to description but also involves shoddy workmanship. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should consider both the non-conformity and the quality of workmanship to ensure a fair and comprehensive resolution.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of **shoddy workmanship** (m), which was present in the precedent case HCA001178/1998 BETWEEN P & M INDUSTRIAL COMPANY LIMITED Plaintiff AND WINNER BOB (H.K.) COMPANY LIMITED Defendant, requiring this factor for all similar cases of non-conformity to contractual description (i*) would lead to the undesirable consequence of limiting buyers' rights to reject non-conforming goods only when there is an additional issue of workmanship quality. This would undermine the principle that goods must conform to the contractual description, regardless of other factors. Conversely, not requiring the factor of shoddy workmanship (m) would allow for a more straightforward application of the rule that buyers can reject goods that do not match the contractual description, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, such as ensuring fairness and upholding the integrity of commercial transactions.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of **shoddy workmanship** (m), which was present in HCA001178/1998, we have the additional factor of **Jessica's right to reject non-conforming goods** (n). This factor (n), when considered alongside the shared circumstances of non-conformity to contractual description (i*), serves a similar function to (m) in the precedent case. Given the presence of (n), we submit that the reasoning in HCA001178/1998 still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as ensuring adherence to contractual descriptions and providing effective remedies for breach of contract, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA001178/1998 BETWEEN P & M INDUSTRIAL COMPANY LIMITED Plaintiff AND WINNER BOB (H.K.) COMPANY LIMITED Defendant, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in terms of non-conformity to contractual description and the right to reject non-conforming goods. However, it also differs in significant ways, such as the issue of shoddy workmanship by Chris, which introduces additional complexities not present in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule that "when goods delivered do not conform to the contractual description, the buyer is entitled to reject the goods and claim damages" finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the additional factor of shoddy workmanship in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that non-conformity to contractual description should allow for rejection and damages (as supported by the precedent) and the counterpoint that shoddy workmanship introduces complexities that require a more nuanced approach.

Considering the underlying legal principles of ensuring adherence to contractual descriptions, providing effective remedies for breach of contract, and maintaining fairness in commercial dealings, we conclude that Jessica is entitled to reject the teapots delivered by PoTe Ltd due to their non-conformity with the contractual description. This decision aligns with the precedent and upholds the integrity of commercial transactions.

However, regarding the issue with Chris, the court should consider the reasonableness of the rectification costs and the impact on the overall project. Jessica should be entitled to claim the cost to remedy the defects (£500) from Chris, as this is a direct and reasonable consequence of the shoddy workmanship.

In summary, Jessica has the right to reject the non-conforming teapots from PoTe Ltd and claim damages. She is also entitled to claim the cost of rectifying the defects from Chris. This decision balances the need for legal consistency with the practicalities and fairness required in the current case.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA001178/1998 BETWEEN P & M INDUSTRIAL COMPANY LIMITED Plaintiff AND WINNER BOB (H.K.) COMPANY LIMITED Defendant)
In the case of HCA001178/1998 BETWEEN P & M INDUSTRIAL COMPANY LIMITED Plaintiff AND WINNER BOB (H.K.) COMPANY LIMITED Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the defendant was in breach of the implied condition that the fabric delivered under the suit contract did not conform to the approved samples. The court found that the colour differences were beyond the commercially accepted tolerance level, and the plaintiff was entitled to reject the fabric and claim damages.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA001178/1998 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Implied Terms in Contracts**: In HCA001178/1998, the implied term was that the fabric should conform to the approved samples. In our current case, the implied term is that the teapots should conform to the description on the website and order form.
- **Legal Concept 2: Conformity to Description**: In HCA001178/1998, the fabric did not conform to the approved samples. In our current case, the teapots do not conform to the specified capacity of 1.2 litres as they have a 1.3 litre capacity.
- **Legal Concept 3: Right to Reject Goods**: In HCA001178/1998, the plaintiff had the right to reject the fabric due to non-conformity. In our current case, Jessica may have the right to reject the teapots due to the discrepancy in capacity.
- **Legal Concept 4: Claim for Damages**: In HCA001178/1998, the plaintiff was entitled to claim damages for the breach. In our current case, Jessica may be entitled to claim damages if she suffers any loss due to the non-conforming teapots.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA001178/1998)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern where goods delivered do not conform to the description or approved samples, the court should decide that the buyer has the right to reject the goods and claim damages. This rule was justified in HCA001178/1998 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that sellers adhere to the terms of the contract and maintaining the integrity of commercial transactions outweigh the negative effects (E-) of allowing buyers to reject goods for minor discrepancies. This rule upholds the underlying values of fairness and reliability in contractual obligations.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA001178/1998 BETWEEN P & M INDUSTRIAL COMPANY LIMITED Plaintiff AND WINNER BOB (H.K.) COMPANY LIMITED Defendant) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Implied Terms in Contracts**: In HCA001178/1998, the implied term was that the fabric should conform to the approved samples. In our current case, the implied term is that the teapots should conform to the description on the website and order form.
- **Legal Concept 2: Conformity to Description**: In HCA001178/1998, the fabric did not conform to the approved samples. In our current case, the teapots do not conform to the specified capacity of 1.2 litres as they have a 1.3 litre capacity.
- **Legal Concept 3: Right to Reject Goods**: In HCA001178/1998, the plaintiff had the right to reject the fabric due to non-conformity. In our current case, Jessica may have the right to reject the teapots due to the discrepancy in capacity.
- **Legal Concept 4: Claim for Damages**: In HCA001178/1998, the plaintiff was entitled to claim damages for the breach. In our current case, Jessica may be entitled to claim damages if she suffers any loss due to the non-conforming teapots.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA001178/1998, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Adherence to Contractual Terms**: Upholding Jessica's right to reject the teapots would reinforce the importance of sellers adhering to the terms of the contract, thereby maintaining the integrity of commercial transactions.
2. **Fairness in Commercial Dealings**: Allowing Jessica to reject the non-conforming teapots ensures fairness, as she should receive exactly what she ordered and paid for.
3. **Reliability in Business Transactions**: This decision would promote reliability in business transactions, as sellers would be more diligent in ensuring that the goods they deliver conform to the agreed specifications.
4. **Protection of Consumer Rights**: Upholding Jessica's right to reject the goods protects consumer rights and ensures that buyers are not forced to accept goods that do not meet the agreed-upon standards.

Therefore, based on the precedent set in HCA001178/1998 and the shared legal concepts and fact patterns, Jessica should have the right to reject the teapots from PoTe Ltd due to the discrepancy in capacity. This decision would uphold the underlying values of fairness, reliability, and adherence to contractual obligations in commercial transactions.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA001178/1998 BETWEEN P & M INDUSTRIAL COMPANY LIMITED Plaintiff AND WINNER BOB (H.K.) COMPANY LIMITED Defendant, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of expert evidence provided by Mr. Yeung, which demonstrated that the fabric did not conform to the approved samples. This expert evidence was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as upholding the integrity of commercial transactions and ensuring adherence to contractual terms, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided a clear, objective basis for determining non-conformity.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of expert evidence is notably absent. Jessica's refusal to accept the teapots from PoTe Ltd is based on a discrepancy in capacity (1.2 litres vs. 1.3 litres), but there is no expert evidence presented to objectively demonstrate that this discrepancy is significant enough to warrant rejection. The absence of such expert evidence weakens the argument for rejecting the teapots solely based on the capacity difference, as it may not be clear whether this difference materially affects the usability or value of the teapots.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in HCA001178/1998 BETWEEN P & M INDUSTRIAL COMPANY LIMITED Plaintiff AND WINNER BOB (H.K.) COMPANY LIMITED Defendant. This factor is the presence of a better deal that Jessica has managed to source on teapots linked to a regular discounted supply of teas from T2U Ltd. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces a potential motive for Jessica to reject the teapots from PoTe Ltd that is unrelated to the actual non-conformity of the goods.

Due to this better deal, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as encouraging buyers to reject goods for minor discrepancies in order to take advantage of better deals elsewhere, than positive ones. Unlike in HCA001178/1998, where the rejection was based on clear, objective evidence of non-conformity, the presence of a better deal in our current case suggests that Jessica's rejection may be driven by economic considerations rather than genuine non-conformity. This undermines the fairness and reliability of commercial transactions, as it allows buyers to use minor discrepancies as a pretext for rejecting goods in favour of more advantageous deals.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA001178/1998 BETWEEN P & M INDUSTRIAL COMPANY LIMITED Plaintiff AND WINNER BOB (H.K.) COMPANY LIMITED Defendant should be stated as: "When both [i*] (goods delivered do not conform to the description or approved samples) and [m] (objective expert evidence demonstrating the non-conformity) are present, the court should decide [o] (the buyer has the right to reject the goods and claim damages)." Omitting [m] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q] (buyers rejecting goods for minor discrepancies without objective evidence, potentially leading to unfair commercial practices and undermining the reliability of business transactions). Indeed, the opinion in HCA001178/1998 explicitly states that the expert evidence provided by Mr. Yeung was crucial to their decision, as it provided a clear, objective basis for determining non-conformity.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA001178/1998 was clearly designed to prevent [undesirable consequence u] (sellers delivering goods that do not conform to the agreed specifications and buyers being forced to accept them without recourse). However, in our current case, there's no risk of [u] occurring because Jessica has already sourced a better deal on teapots linked to a regular discounted supply of teas from T2U Ltd. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The presence of a better deal suggests that Jessica's rejection may be driven by economic considerations rather than genuine non-conformity, which undermines the fairness and reliability of commercial transactions.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the expert evidence (factor m), which was present in the precedent case HCA001178/1998 BETWEEN P & M INDUSTRIAL COMPANY LIMITED Plaintiff AND WINNER BOB (H.K.) COMPANY LIMITED Defendant, requiring this factor for all similar cases of non-conformity to description would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would place an undue burden on buyers to always provide expert evidence to reject goods, even in clear cases of non-conformity. Conversely, not requiring expert evidence would allow for a more practical and fair approach, where buyers can reject goods based on obvious discrepancies that do not require technical expertise to identify. This better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, which aim to protect buyers from receiving goods that do not meet the agreed specifications and to ensure fairness in commercial transactions.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the expert evidence (factor m), which was present in HCA001178/1998, we have the additional factor of a clear and measurable discrepancy in the product specification (factor n). This factor n, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of non-conformity to description, serves a similar function to expert evidence in the precedent case. Given the presence of a clear and measurable discrepancy in the product specification, we submit that the reasoning in HCA001178/1998 still applies. The positive effects on relevant legal values, such as ensuring adherence to contractual terms and protecting consumer rights, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. Therefore, Jessica should have the right to reject the teapots from PoTe Ltd due to the discrepancy in capacity.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA001178/1998 BETWEEN P & M INDUSTRIAL COMPANY LIMITED Plaintiff AND WINNER BOB (H.K.) COMPANY LIMITED Defendant, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in terms of implied terms in contracts, conformity to description, the right to reject goods, and the potential to claim damages. However, it also differs in significant ways, such as the absence of expert evidence and the presence of a better deal for Jessica.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case, which allows a buyer to reject goods and claim damages when the goods do not conform to the description or approved samples and there is objective expert evidence demonstrating the non-conformity, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in the context of the current case where the discrepancy in the teapots' capacity is clear and measurable, but not supported by expert evidence.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that requiring expert evidence in every case of non-conformity would place an undue burden on buyers (Step 9) and the counterpoint that the presence of a better deal for Jessica suggests her rejection may be driven by economic considerations rather than genuine non-conformity (Step 6).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, reliability in business transactions, and adherence to contractual obligations, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Jessica should have the right to reject the teapots from PoTe Ltd due to the discrepancy in capacity. This decision aligns with the legal precedent set in HCA001178/1998, while also serving justice and legal consistency by recognizing the clear and measurable discrepancy in the product specification as a valid basis for rejection, even in the absence of expert evidence.

Therefore, Jessica is entitled to reject the teapots from PoTe Ltd and is not contractually liable for accepting the delivery of the non-conforming goods. This decision upholds the principles of fairness and reliability in commercial transactions, ensuring that buyers receive goods that meet the agreed specifications.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (CACV 240/98 BETWEEN SAMSUNG HONG KONG LIMITED Plaintiff (Appellant) AND KEEN TIME TRADING LIMITED Defendant (Respondent))
In the case of CACV 240/98 BETWEEN SAMSUNG HONG KONG LIMITED Plaintiff (Appellant) AND KEEN TIME TRADING LIMITED Defendant (Respondent) (precedent p), the plaintiff sold polyester fibres to the defendant under a written contract specifying 1.5D polyester fibres. The defendant failed to open a Letter of Credit, leading to a breach. The plaintiff's supplier delivered 1.4D polyester fibres instead of 1.5D. The court ruled that the goods did not conform to the contract description, and the plaintiff was only entitled to nominal damages because it could not prove that it could deliver goods conforming to the contract description (outcome o).

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in CACV 240/98 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Breach of Contract**: In both cases, there is a breach of contract due to non-conforming goods.
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In CACV 240/98, the polyester fibres delivered were 1.4D instead of the contracted 1.5D. In the current case, the teapots delivered have a 1.3 litre capacity instead of the contracted 1.2 litre capacity.
- **Legal Concept 2: Right to Reject Non-Conforming Goods**: Both cases involve the right of the buyer to reject goods that do not conform to the contract description.
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In CACV 240/98, the defendant had the right to reject the 1.4D polyester fibres. In the current case, Jessica has the right to reject the 1.3 litre teapots.
- **Legal Concept 3: Nominal Damages**: The concept of awarding nominal damages when the plaintiff cannot prove actual loss due to the breach.
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In CACV 240/98, the plaintiff was awarded nominal damages because it could not prove it could deliver conforming goods. In the current case, if Jessica cannot prove actual loss or that she could not source conforming teapots, she may only be entitled to nominal damages.
- **Legal Concept 4: Commercial Tolerance**: The issue of whether a small deviation from the contract description can be tolerated.
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In CACV 240/98, the court did not accept a 15% deviation as tolerable. In the current case, the deviation in teapot capacity (1.2 litres to 1.3 litres) may also be considered non-tolerable.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (CACV 240/98)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern where goods delivered do not conform to the contract description, the court should decide that the buyer has the right to reject the goods and the seller may only be entitled to nominal damages if they cannot prove actual loss or the ability to deliver conforming goods. This rule was justified in CACV 240/98 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring contractual compliance and protecting the buyer's rights outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially minor deviations being considered breaches. This upholds the principle that contract terms must be strictly adhered to, ensuring fairness and predictability in commercial transactions.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (CACV 240/98 BETWEEN SAMSUNG HONG KONG LIMITED Plaintiff (Appellant) AND KEEN TIME TRADING LIMITED Defendant (Respondent)) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Breach of Contract**: In both cases, there is a breach of contract due to non-conforming goods.
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In CACV 240/98, the polyester fibres delivered were 1.4D instead of the contracted 1.5D. In the current case, the teapots delivered have a 1.3 litre capacity instead of the contracted 1.2 litre capacity.

- **Legal Concept 2: Right to Reject Non-Conforming Goods**: Both cases involve the right of the buyer to reject goods that do not conform to the contract description.
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In CACV 240/98, the defendant had the right to reject the 1.4D polyester fibres. In the current case, Jessica has the right to reject the 1.3 litre teapots.

- **Legal Concept 3: Nominal Damages**: The concept of awarding nominal damages when the plaintiff cannot prove actual loss due to the breach.
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In CACV 240/98, the plaintiff was awarded nominal damages because it could not prove it could deliver conforming goods. In the current case, if Jessica cannot prove actual loss or that she could not source conforming teapots, she may only be entitled to nominal damages.

- **Legal Concept 4: Commercial Tolerance**: The issue of whether a small deviation from the contract description can be tolerated.
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In CACV 240/98, the court did not accept a 15% deviation as tolerable. In the current case, the deviation in teapot capacity (1.2 litres to 1.3 litres) may also be considered non-tolerable.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in CACV 240/98. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Contractual Compliance**: Upholding the strict adherence to contract terms ensures that parties can rely on the precise terms of their agreements, promoting certainty and predictability in commercial transactions.

2. **Protecting Buyer’s Rights**: Allowing Jessica to reject the non-conforming teapots protects her right to receive exactly what she contracted for, ensuring that sellers are held accountable for delivering goods that meet the agreed specifications.

3. **Discouraging Non-Conformance**: By not tolerating deviations from contract terms, the court sends a clear message that sellers must meet their contractual obligations precisely, thereby discouraging any laxity in fulfilling contract terms.

4. **Fairness in Commercial Dealings**: Ensuring that buyers are not forced to accept goods that do not meet the contract description maintains fairness in commercial dealings, as buyers should not bear the burden of non-conforming goods.

Therefore, applying the rule from CACV 240/98 to the current case, Jessica should be entitled to reject the 1.3 litre teapots and may only be liable for nominal damages if she cannot prove actual loss or the ability to source conforming teapots. This decision aligns with the principles of contract law and ensures fairness and predictability in commercial transactions.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case CACV 240/98 BETWEEN SAMSUNG HONG KONG LIMITED Plaintiff (Appellant) AND KEEN TIME TRADING LIMITED Defendant (Respondent), the court's decision was significantly influenced by the factor of **commercial tolerance**. The court considered whether a small deviation from the contract description could be tolerated, ultimately deciding that the deviation was not acceptable. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—such as upholding strict contractual compliance and protecting the buyer's rights—outweighed any potential drawbacks, such as minor deviations being considered breaches. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of **commercial tolerance** is notably absent as there is no evidence or argument presented that a deviation in the teapot capacity from 1.2 litres to 1.3 litres could be commercially tolerated. Therefore, the absence of this factor means that the court in the current case does not need to consider whether a small deviation is acceptable, simplifying the decision to reject the non-conforming goods.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor **(Jessica's ability to source a better deal on teapots linked to a regular discounted supply of teas from T2U Ltd.)** that was not present in CACV 240/98 BETWEEN SAMSUNG HONG KONG LIMITED Plaintiff (Appellant) AND KEEN TIME TRADING LIMITED Defendant (Respondent). This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of non-conforming goods because it provides Jessica with an alternative source for the teapots, which mitigates any potential loss she might have suffered due to the non-conforming goods from PoTe Ltd. Due to this factor, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as unjustly enriching PoTe Ltd. by forcing Jessica to accept non-conforming goods when she has a better alternative, than positive ones, unlike in CACV 240/98. This is because Jessica's ability to source a better deal ensures that she is not left without the goods she needs, thereby reducing the impact of rejecting the non-conforming goods.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from CACV 240/98 BETWEEN SAMSUNG HONG KONG LIMITED Plaintiff (Appellant) AND KEEN TIME TRADING LIMITED Defendant (Respondent) should be stated as: "When both the fact pattern of non-conforming goods (i*) and the absence of a commercially tolerable deviation (m) are present, the court should decide that the buyer has the right to reject the goods and the seller may only be entitled to nominal damages if they cannot prove actual loss or the ability to deliver conforming goods (o)." Omitting the absence of a commercially tolerable deviation (m) from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence (q) of buyers being forced to accept non-conforming goods even when they have a better alternative, thereby unjustly enriching the seller and undermining the buyer's right to receive exactly what was contracted for. Indeed, the opinion in CACV 240/98 explicitly states that the court did not accept a 15% deviation as tolerable, highlighting the importance of the absence of a commercially tolerable deviation to their decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in CACV 240/98 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence (u) of sellers delivering non-conforming goods and buyers being left without recourse to reject such goods, thereby ensuring strict adherence to contract terms and protecting the buyer's rights. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence (u) occurring because Jessica has already sourced a better deal on teapots linked to a regular discounted supply of teas from T2U Ltd. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—ensuring buyers are not left without conforming goods—is not relevant to our situation. Jessica's ability to source an alternative supply mitigates any potential loss, making the strict application of the rule unnecessary and potentially unjust.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of commercial tolerance (m), which was present in the precedent case CACV 240/98 BETWEEN SAMSUNG HONG KONG LIMITED Plaintiff (Appellant) AND KEEN TIME TRADING LIMITED Defendant (Respondent), requiring this factor for all similar cases of non-conforming goods (fact pattern i*) would lead to the undesirable consequence of buyers being forced to accept goods that do not meet the contract specifications, even when they have better alternatives. Conversely, not requiring the factor of commercial tolerance would allow for a more straightforward application of the principle that buyers have the right to reject non-conforming goods, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, such as ensuring contractual compliance and protecting the buyer's rights.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of commercial tolerance (m), which was present in CACV 240/98, we have the additional factor of Jessica's ability to source a better deal on teapots linked to a regular discounted supply of teas from T2U Ltd. This factor (n), when considered alongside the shared circumstances of non-conforming goods (fact pattern i*), serves a similar function to the absence of commercial tolerance in the precedent case. Given the presence of this alternative supply, we submit that the reasoning in CACV 240/98 still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as ensuring Jessica is not left without the goods she needs and protecting her right to receive exactly what was contracted for, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to CACV 240/98 BETWEEN SAMSUNG HONG KONG LIMITED Plaintiff (Appellant) AND KEEN TIME TRADING LIMITED Defendant (Respondent), the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the issue of non-conforming goods and the right of the buyer to reject such goods. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of a commercially tolerable deviation and Jessica's ability to source a better deal on teapots linked to a regular discounted supply of teas from T2U Ltd.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case—that the buyer has the right to reject non-conforming goods and the seller may only be entitled to nominal damages if they cannot prove actual loss or the ability to deliver conforming goods—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the unique factors present in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the absence of commercial tolerance simplifies the decision to reject the non-conforming goods and the counterpoint that Jessica's ability to source an alternative supply mitigates any potential loss, making the strict application of the rule unnecessary.

Considering the underlying legal principles of ensuring contractual compliance, protecting the buyer's rights, and maintaining fairness in commercial dealings, we conclude that Jessica is entitled to reject the 1.3 litre teapots from PoTe Ltd. This decision aligns with the principle that contract terms must be strictly adhered to, ensuring that buyers receive exactly what they contracted for. Additionally, Jessica's ability to source a better deal on teapots further supports her right to reject the non-conforming goods without suffering any loss.

Therefore, Jessica has no contractual liability to PoTe Ltd for rejecting the non-conforming teapots. This decision serves justice and legal consistency by upholding the buyer's right to receive goods that conform to the contract description and ensuring that sellers are held accountable for delivering goods that meet the agreed specifications.
