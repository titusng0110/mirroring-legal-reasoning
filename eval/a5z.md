#### 2. Applicable Laws

1. **Contract Law**:
   - **Formation and Terms of Contract**: Offer, acceptance, consideration, and intention to create legal relations.
   - **Performance and Breach**: Conditions, warranties, and remedies for breach.
   - **Partial Performance**: Quantum meruit claims.
   - **Sale of Goods Ordinance (Cap. 26)**: Implied terms regarding the description, quality, and fitness for purpose of goods.

2. **Case Law**:
   - **Cutter v Powell (1795)**: Entire obligations and partial performance.
   - **Hoenig v Isaacs [1952]**: Substantial performance and the right to payment.
   - **Bolton v Mahadeva [1972]**: Defective performance and the right to payment.
   - **Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd [1962]**: Innominate terms and remedies for breach.

#### 3. Application of Law to Facts

1. **Lawrence's Claim for £40,000**:
   - **Contractual Obligation**: Lawrence agreed to complete the entire project for £100,000. His failure to complete the teashop constitutes a breach of contract.
   - **Partial Performance**: Under **Cutter v Powell**, Lawrence may not be entitled to any payment unless there is substantial performance. However, under **Hoenig v Isaacs**, if the work on the residence is substantially complete, he may claim a quantum meruit for the value of the work done.
   - **Remedies for Breach**: Jessica can claim damages for the cost of engaging Chris to complete the teashop (£40,000). Therefore, Lawrence's claim for £40,000 may be offset by Jessica's damages.

2. **Chris's Claim for Payment**:
   - **Contractual Obligation**: Chris completed the work, but Jessica claims it is shoddy.
   - **Defective Performance**: Under **Bolton v Mahadeva**, if the defects are significant, Jessica may withhold payment or claim the cost of remedying the defects (£500).
   - **Substantial Performance**: If the defects are minor, Chris may be entitled to payment minus the cost of rectifying the defects. Jessica should pay Chris £39,500 (£40,000 - £500).

3. **Luke's Claim for £1,000**:
   - **Contractual Obligation**: Jessica cancelled the contract before Luke completed the work.
   - **Mitigation of Loss**: Luke should mitigate his loss by stopping work upon cancellation. Completing the work despite cancellation does not entitle him to payment.
   - **Remedies for Breach**: Luke may claim damages for any loss incurred due to the cancellation, but not the full contract price. Jessica is not liable for the £1,000.

4. **PoTe Ltd's Delivery of Teapots**:
   - **Sale of Goods Ordinance**: Goods must match the description (Section 15).
   - **Non-Conforming Goods**: The teapots do not match the description (1.3 litres instead of 1.2 litres). Jessica is entitled to reject the goods under Section 15.
   - **Right to Reject**: Jessica can refuse to accept delivery and is not liable for payment.

### Conclusion

- **Lawrence**: Jessica may offset Lawrence's claim for £40,000 against her damages for breach of contract. Lawrence may not be entitled to any additional payment.
- **Chris**: Jessica should pay Chris £39,500 after deducting the cost of remedying the defects.
- **Luke**: Jessica is not liable for the £1,000 as Luke should have mitigated his loss upon cancellation.
- **PoTe Ltd**: Jessica is entitled to reject the teapots and is not liable for payment.
