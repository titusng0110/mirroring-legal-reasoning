### Legal Analysis of the Scenario

#### 1. Identification of Legal Issues

The scenario presents two primary legal issues:
1. **Luke's Contract**: Whether the contract between Luke and the Yorkshire Dales Railway (YDR) for the restoration of the Hamilton Flyer is discharged by frustration due to the destruction of the train, and whether Luke can recover the £5,000 he spent and the £8,000 he was due to be paid.
2. **Peter's Contract**: Whether Peter's contract for the purchase of tickets for the Hamilton Flyer is discharged by frustration due to the train's destruction, and whether he can recover the £100 he paid for the tickets.

#### 2. Applicable Laws

The applicable laws and legal principles include:
1. **Doctrine of Frustration**: This common law doctrine discharges parties from their contractual obligations when an unforeseen event renders the contract impossible to perform or radically different from what was agreed upon.
2. **Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23, Sections 16 and 17**: These sections provide statutory guidance on the adjustment of rights and liabilities of parties to frustrated contracts, including the recovery of sums paid or payable.

Relevant case law includes:
- **Davis Contractors Ltd v Fareham UDC [1956] AC 696**: Establishes that frustration occurs when an unforeseen event makes contractual obligations impossible or radically different.
- **National Carriers Ltd v Panalpina (Northern) Ltd [1981] AC 675**: Reinforces the principles of frustration and its narrow application.
- **J Lauritzen AS v Wijsmuller BV (The Super Servant Two) [1990] 1 Lloyd's Rep 1**: Summarizes the essence of the doctrine of frustration.
- **HCA 3987/2003 Sinoearn International Ltd v Hyundai-CCECC Joint Venture**: Discusses the application of the doctrine of frustration in Hong Kong law.

#### 3. Application of Law to Facts

**Luke's Contract**

- **Frustration**: The destruction of the Hamilton Flyer by an explosion, with no fault attributable to any party, constitutes an unforeseen event that makes the performance of Luke's contract impossible. The contract is therefore likely to be discharged by frustration.
- **Recovery of Monies**: Under Section 16(2) of the Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23, all sums paid or payable before the time of discharge are recoverable. Luke can recover the £5,000 he spent on the restoration as money received by YDR for his use. The £8,000 payable to Luke ceases to be payable since the contract is discharged.

**Peter's Contract**

- **Frustration**: The destruction of the Hamilton Flyer means that the specific performance Peter contracted for (a ride on the Hamilton Flyer) is impossible. The substitution of the Selby Miner does not fulfill the specific purpose of Peter's contract, which was to relive trips made with his father on the Hamilton Flyer. Therefore, the contract is likely to be discharged by frustration.
- **Recovery of Monies**: Under Section 16(2) of the Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23, Peter can recover the £100 he paid for the tickets as money received by YDR for his use. Since the contract is frustrated, the sum paid is recoverable.

### Conclusion

**Luke**:
- The contract for the restoration of the Hamilton Flyer is discharged by frustration due to the destruction of the train.
- Luke can recover the £5,000 he spent on the restoration.
- The £8,000 payable to Luke ceases to be payable.

**Peter**:
- The contract for the purchase of tickets for the Hamilton Flyer is discharged by frustration due to the destruction of the train.
- Peter can recover the £100 he paid for the tickets.

Both Luke and Peter are entitled to recover their respective sums under the Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23, as the contracts have been frustrated by an unforeseen event that rendered performance impossible.
