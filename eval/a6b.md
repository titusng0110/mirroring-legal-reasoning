### Minor Premise:

1. Sex Discrimination Ordinance Cap. 480 Section 87 Subsection 3:
   - The term in the verification sheet incorporating WMA standard conditions is a term of a contract.
   - The term purports to exclude or limit liability for damages or losses caused by the service provider’s employees, servants, or agents.
   - This section does not apply as there is no indication that the term relates to sex discrimination.

2. Disability Discrimination Ordinance Cap. 487 Section 83 Subsection 3:
   - The term in the verification sheet incorporating WMA standard conditions is a term of a contract.
   - The term purports to exclude or limit liability for damages or losses caused by the service provider’s employees, servants, or agents.

   - Therefore, the term is unenforceable as per this section.

### Conclusion:

Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 8 Subsection 1 applies, and the term in the verification sheet incorporating WMA standard conditions is unenforceable. Sparkling Bright cannot successfully resist S&A’s demand for compensation for the laptop. Additionally, Sparkling Bright must resume weekly cleanings as per the original agreement, as the temporary reduction was conditional and the condition (office remaining spick and span) was not met.

## Deductive Reasoning: ca

### Relevant law:

Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (CECO) and case law from Chang Pui Yin v Bank of Singapore Limited and Poosaala Ram Prasad v. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Ltd [2022] HKCA 1876

### Major Premise:

1. Chang Pui Yin v Bank of Singapore Limited

   Conditions:
   - A clause attempts to exclude or restrict an obligation or duty by reference to a contractual term or non-contractual notice
   - The clause is not confined in its operation to 'execution only' services
   - The clause does not satisfy the requirement of reasonableness under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (CECO)
   - The clause is found to be unconscionable

   Consequences:
   - The clause will not be effective to exclude or restrict liability for negligence

   Exceptions:
   - The clause satisfies the requirement of reasonableness under the CECO

2. Poosaala Ram Prasad v. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Ltd [2022] HKCA 1876

   Conditions:
   - A term is included in a contract that specifies a particular method of communication for notices
   - The party responsible for giving notice fails to use the specified method of communication

   Consequences:
   - The party responsible for giving notice may be in breach of contract

   Exceptions:
   - The general terms of the contract explicitly override the specific terms
   - The failure to use the specified method of communication did not result in any actual loss or damage to the other party

### Minor Premise:

1. Chang Pui Yin v Bank of Singapore Limited:
- The verification sheet contains a clause that attempts to exclude or restrict liability for damages or losses caused by Sparkling Bright's employees.
- The clause is not confined to 'execution only' services.
- The clause does not satisfy the requirement of reasonableness under the CECO because it was printed in small font and not explicitly brought to S&A's attention.
- The clause could be found unconscionable as it was included in a non-contractual notice (the verification sheet) and not part of the original agreement.

2. Poosaala Ram Prasad v. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Ltd [2022] HKCA 1876:
- The agreement between Sparkling Bright and S&A did not specify a particular method of communication for notices.
- Sparkling Bright's request to reduce the frequency of cleanings and S&A's acceptance were communicated in writing, which is a reasonable method of communication.
- There is no evidence that the failure to specify a method of communication resulted in any actual loss or damage to S&A.

### Conclusion:

1. The clause in the verification sheet incorporating WMA standard conditions is likely not valid and enforceable because it does not satisfy the requirement of reasonableness under the CECO and could be found unconscionable. Therefore, Sparkling Bright cannot successfully resist S&A’s demand for compensation for the laptop.

2. Sparkling Bright is not in breach of contract for reducing the frequency of cleanings to fortnightly, as the communication method used was reasonable and did not result in any actual loss or damage to S&A. Therefore, Sparkling Bright can successfully resist S&A’s demand to resume weekly cleanings immediately.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HC A 2279/2008 BETWEEN DBS BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED Plaintiff and SAN-HOT HK INDUSTRIAL COMPANY LIMITED 1st Defendant HAO TING (郝婷) 2nd Defendant)

In the case of HC A 2279/2008 BETWEEN DBS BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED Plaintiff and SAN-HOT HK INDUSTRIAL COMPANY LIMITED 1st Defendant HAO TING (郝婷) 2nd Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that DBS Bank was not liable for providing investment advice to San-Hot (BVI) due to the clear contractual terms that defined the scope of services as "transaction execution service only" and included disclaimers of responsibility for investment advice. The court emphasized the importance of the contractual context and the principle of "contractual estoppel" to negate the existence of any duty to render advice.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in HC A 2279/2008 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Contractual Estoppel**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In HC A 2279/2008, the contract between DBS and San-Hot (BVI) included express terms and disclaimers that negated any duty to provide investment advice. Similarly, in our current case, the verification sheet signed by S&A’s office manager included a reference to WMA standard conditions, which relieve Sparkling Bright from liability for damages caused by its employees.

- **Legal Concept 2: Incorporation of Terms by Reference**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** In HC A 2279/2008, the court considered the incorporation of terms by reference in the Private Banking Agreement. In our current case, the verification sheet references the WMA standard conditions, which are freely available online and thus incorporated by reference.

- **Legal Concept 3: Notice of Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In HC A 2279/2008, the court noted that the terms were clearly stated in the contractual documents, and the customer was aware of them. In our current case, the verification sheet mentioned the WMA conditions, and S&A had the opportunity to request and review these terms.

- **Legal Concept 4: Reasonableness of Exclusion Clauses**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** In HC A 2279/2008, the court found that the exclusion clauses were reasonable and standard in the industry. Similarly, the WMA conditions are standard in the cleaning and waste management industry, and the exclusion of liability for damages is a common practice.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HC A 2279/2008)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of clear contractual terms and disclaimers incorporated by reference, the court should decide that the service provider is not liable for damages or losses caused by its employees. This rule was justified in HC A 2279/2008 because the positive effects of upholding clear contractual terms and disclaimers on the underlying values of contractual certainty and fairness outweigh the negative effects of potentially limiting the client's recourse for damages.

Applying this rule to our current case, Sparkling Bright can successfully resist S&A’s demand for compensation for the laptop by relying on the WMA standard conditions referenced in the verification sheet. Additionally, the request to resume weekly cleanings immediately can be addressed by referring to the temporary agreement to reduce the frequency of cleanings, which was accepted by S&A with the condition that the office remains clean. Sparkling Bright should ensure compliance with this condition moving forward.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HC A 2279/2008 BETWEEN DBS BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED Plaintiff and SAN-HOT HK INDUSTRIAL COMPANY LIMITED 1st Defendant HAO TING (郝婷) 2nd Defendant) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Contractual Estoppel**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In HC A 2279/2008, the contract included express terms and disclaimers that negated any duty to provide investment advice. Similarly, in our current case, the verification sheet signed by S&A’s office manager included a reference to WMA standard conditions, which relieve Sparkling Bright from liability for damages caused by its employees.

- **Legal Concept 2: Incorporation of Terms by Reference**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** In HC A 2279/2008, the court considered the incorporation of terms by reference in the Private Banking Agreement. In our current case, the verification sheet references the WMA standard conditions, which are freely available online and thus incorporated by reference.

- **Legal Concept 3: Notice of Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In HC A 2279/2008, the court noted that the terms were clearly stated in the contractual documents, and the customer was aware of them. In our current case, the verification sheet mentioned the WMA conditions, and S&A had the opportunity to request and review these terms.

- **Legal Concept 4: Reasonableness of Exclusion Clauses**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** In HC A 2279/2008, the court found that the exclusion clauses were reasonable and standard in the industry. Similarly, the WMA conditions are standard in the cleaning and waste management industry, and the exclusion of liability for damages is a common practice.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HC A 2279/2008, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Contractual Certainty:** Upholding the WMA standard conditions referenced in the verification sheet would reinforce the principle that clear and express contractual terms should be respected. This promotes certainty and predictability in commercial transactions, allowing parties to understand their rights and obligations clearly.

2. **Fairness:** The WMA standard conditions are freely available and are a common practice in the industry. S&A had the opportunity to review these terms and chose to proceed with the agreement. It would be unfair to allow S&A to claim damages when they had agreed to terms that explicitly excluded such liability.

3. **Encouragement of Due Diligence:** By enforcing the terms referenced in the verification sheet, the court would encourage parties to exercise due diligence in reviewing and understanding the terms of their agreements. This promotes a more informed and responsible approach to contract formation.

4. **Industry Standards:** The WMA conditions are standard in the cleaning and waste management industry. Enforcing these terms aligns with industry practices and expectations, ensuring that service providers are not unduly burdened with liabilities that are typically excluded in such agreements.

Therefore, Sparkling Bright can successfully resist S&A’s demand for compensation for the laptop by relying on the WMA standard conditions referenced in the verification sheet. Additionally, the request to resume weekly cleanings immediately can be addressed by referring to the temporary agreement to reduce the frequency of cleanings, which was accepted by S&A with the condition that the office remains clean. Sparkling Bright should ensure compliance with this condition moving forward.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HC A 2279/2008 BETWEEN DBS BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED Plaintiff and SAN-HOT HK INDUSTRIAL COMPANY LIMITED 1st Defendant HAO TING (郝婷) 2nd Defendant, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the clear and express contractual terms and disclaimers that were incorporated by reference and acknowledged by the parties involved. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as contractual certainty and fairness, outweighed any potential drawbacks because the parties had explicitly agreed to the terms and were aware of the limitations of liability.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of clear and express contractual terms being acknowledged by both parties is notably absent. The verification sheet containing the reference to the WMA standard conditions was signed by S&A’s office manager, but there is no evidence that S&A was explicitly made aware of or had acknowledged these terms at the time of signing the original cleaning agreement. The reference to the WMA conditions was in small font and may not have been sufficiently brought to S&A’s attention, unlike the clear and express terms in the precedent case.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in HC A 2279/2008 BETWEEN DBS BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED Plaintiff and SAN-HOT HK INDUSTRIAL COMPANY LIMITED 1st Defendant HAO TING (郝婷) 2nd Defendant. This factor is the temporary modification of the service agreement, where S&A agreed to a reduced frequency of cleanings on the condition that the office remains clean. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces an element of conditional performance that was not present in the precedent case.

Due to this temporary modification and the condition attached to it, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the agreed-upon conditional performance and potentially leading to disputes over the interpretation of temporary agreements. Unlike in HC A 2279/2008, where the terms were clear and unambiguous, the temporary modification in our case introduces ambiguity and potential for disagreement, which could outweigh the benefits of enforcing the WMA standard conditions without considering the specific context of the temporary agreement.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HC A 2279/2008 BETWEEN DBS BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED Plaintiff and SAN-HOT HK INDUSTRIAL COMPANY LIMITED 1st Defendant HAO TING (郝婷) 2nd Defendant should be stated as: "When both [clear and express contractual terms acknowledged by both parties] and [explicit notice of terms] are present, the court should decide [to uphold the exclusion of liability]." Omitting [explicit notice of terms] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q], which is the unfair imposition of liability on a party that reasonably believed it had limited its liability through standard industry terms. Indeed, the opinion in HC A 2279/2008 explicitly states that the clear and express terms were crucial to their decision, as it emphasized the importance of the contractual context and the principle of "contractual estoppel" to negate the existence of any duty to render advice.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HC A 2279/2008 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of parties being unfairly held liable for obligations they explicitly disclaimed in clear and express contractual terms. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because the verification sheet's reference to the WMA standard conditions was not sufficiently brought to S&A’s attention. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—to uphold clear and acknowledged contractual terms—is not relevant to our situation where the terms were not explicitly acknowledged by both parties.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the explicit notice of terms (factor m), which was present in the precedent case HC A 2279/2008 BETWEEN DBS BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED Plaintiff and SAN-HOT HK INDUSTRIAL COMPANY LIMITED 1st Defendant HAO TING (郝婷) 2nd Defendant, requiring this factor for all similar cases of clear and express contractual terms and disclaimers incorporated by reference would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would create an overly burdensome requirement for service providers to ensure that every term is explicitly acknowledged by the client, even when the terms are standard in the industry and freely available. Conversely, not requiring explicit notice of terms would allow for a more practical and efficient approach, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contractual certainty and fairness. This approach encourages parties to exercise due diligence in reviewing and understanding the terms of their agreements, promoting a more informed and responsible approach to contract formation.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the explicit notice of terms (factor m), which was present in HC A 2279/2008, we have the additional factor of the temporary modification of the service agreement (factor n). This temporary modification, where S&A agreed to a reduced frequency of cleanings on the condition that the office remains clean, serves a similar function to the explicit notice of terms in the precedent case. Given the presence of this temporary modification, we submit that the reasoning in HC A 2279/2008 still applies, as the positive effects on contractual certainty and fairness would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. The temporary modification demonstrates that S&A was actively engaged in the contractual relationship and had the opportunity to address any concerns about the terms of service, thereby compensating for the lack of explicit notice of the WMA standard conditions.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HC A 2279/2008 BETWEEN DBS BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED Plaintiff and SAN-HOT HK INDUSTRIAL COMPANY LIMITED 1st Defendant HAO TING (郝婷) 2nd Defendant, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the incorporation of terms by reference and the principle of contractual estoppel. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the lack of explicit notice of the WMA standard conditions to S&A and the temporary modification of the service agreement.

The proposed legal rule of upholding exclusion of liability when clear and express contractual terms are acknowledged by both parties finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of explicit notice of terms (as emphasized in the precedent) and the practical need for contractual certainty and fairness in commercial transactions.

Considering the underlying legal principles of contractual certainty, fairness, and the encouragement of due diligence, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Sparkling Bright can successfully resist S&A’s demand for compensation for the laptop. This decision is based on the incorporation of the WMA standard conditions by reference, which is a common practice in the industry, and the fact that S&A had the opportunity to request and review these terms.

However, regarding the request to resume weekly cleanings immediately, Sparkling Bright should comply with this demand. The temporary modification of the service agreement was conditional on the office remaining clean, and given the upcoming important guests, it is reasonable for S&A to require the original level of service to ensure their premises are presentable.

In conclusion, Sparkling Bright is not liable for the damages to the laptop due to the WMA standard conditions referenced in the verification sheet, but it should resume weekly cleanings immediately to fulfill its contractual obligations and maintain the agreed standard of service. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency.

### Minor Premise:

1. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 7 Subsection 1:
   - Sparkling Bright attempts to exclude or restrict liability for negligence by reference to the WMA standard conditions.
   - The liability in question is for property damage, not death or personal injury.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

2. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 7 Subsection 2:
   - Sparkling Bright attempts to exclude or restrict liability for negligence by reference to the WMA standard conditions.
   - The liability is for other loss or damage resulting from negligence (the damaged laptop).
   - The term can only exclude or restrict liability if it satisfies the requirement of reasonableness.
   - The term was printed in small font on a verification sheet and referred to standard conditions available online, which may not satisfy the requirement of reasonableness.
   - Therefore, this section applies, and the term may not be enforceable if it is deemed unreasonable.

3. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 7 Subsection 3:
   - The WMA standard conditions purport to exclude or restrict liability for negligence.
   - S&A’s office manager’s agreement to or awareness of the verification sheet is not of itself to be taken as indicating voluntary acceptance of any risk.
   - Therefore, this section applies, and S&A’s office manager’s signature does not indicate voluntary acceptance of the risk.

4. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 3 Subsection 4:
   - The WMA standard conditions are being assessed for reasonableness.
   - The court or arbitrator shall consider whether the language in which the term is expressed is understood by S&A’s office manager.
   - The term was in small font and may not have been clearly understood by S&A’s office manager.
   - Therefore, this section applies, and the term may be deemed unreasonable.

5. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 4:
   - The contract does not contain a term excluding or restricting liability for misrepresentation.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

### Conclusion:

Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 7 Subsection 2, 3, and Section 3 Subsection 4 apply. The term in the WMA standard conditions excluding liability for damages caused by Sparkling Bright's employees is likely to be deemed unreasonable and unenforceable. Therefore, Sparkling Bright cannot successfully resist S&A’s demand for compensation for the damaged laptop. Additionally, Sparkling Bright must resume weekly cleanings as per the original agreement, as the temporary reduction was conditional and has now been revoked by S&A.

### Conclusion:

The term in the WMA standard conditions excluding liability for damages caused by Sparkling Bright's employees is valid under Hong Kong law. Sparkling Bright can successfully resist S&A’s demand for compensation for the laptop. However, the demand to resume weekly cleanings is a separate issue related to the modification of the contract terms, and Sparkling Bright should comply with this request as it pertains to the agreed service level.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE)
In the case of HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE (precedent p), the court ruled that the exclusion clause in the contract did not exclude the defendants from liability for loss and damage which they could have avoided or prevented with reasonable diligence. The court emphasized that exclusion clauses must be construed contra proferentem, meaning any ambiguity should be resolved against the party seeking to rely on the clause. The court also highlighted that exclusion clauses should not cover entirely preventable acts of negligence.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Exclusion Clauses**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, there is an exclusion clause that attempts to limit or exclude liability for damages caused by the service provider's employees.
- **Legal Concept 2: Contra Proferentem Rule**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: The exclusion clause is ambiguous and must be construed against the party seeking to rely on it.
- **Legal Concept 3: Reasonable Diligence**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: The service provider's liability is contingent on whether they exercised reasonable diligence to prevent the damage.
- **Legal Concept 4: Preventable Acts of Negligence**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: The damage was caused by an act that could have been prevented with reasonable diligence.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of an exclusion clause attempting to limit liability for damages caused by the service provider's employees, and the damage could have been prevented with reasonable diligence, the court should decide that the exclusion clause does not exclude liability. This rule was justified in HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that service providers cannot escape liability for preventable acts of negligence outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially limiting the scope of exclusion clauses in contracts. This promotes accountability and diligence among service providers, aligning with the underlying values and principles of contract law.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Exclusion Clauses**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: The WMA standard conditions include a term that attempts to relieve Sparkling Bright from liability for any damages or losses caused by its employees, servants, or agents.
- **Legal Concept 2: Contra Proferentem Rule**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: The exclusion clause is ambiguous and must be construed against Sparkling Bright, the party seeking to rely on it.
- **Legal Concept 3: Reasonable Diligence**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: Sparkling Bright's liability is contingent on whether they exercised reasonable diligence to prevent the damage. In this case, Sam's act of balancing a pail of water on a narrow ladder while taking a TikTok video clearly shows a lack of reasonable diligence.
- **Legal Concept 4: Preventable Acts of Negligence**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: The damage to the laptop was caused by an act that could have been prevented with reasonable diligence. Sam's negligence in attempting a dangerous balancing act while distracted by making a video is a preventable act of negligence.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Promoting Accountability**: Ensuring that service providers like Sparkling Bright cannot escape liability for preventable acts of negligence promotes accountability. Service providers will be more diligent in their operations, knowing they cannot rely on exclusion clauses to avoid liability for their employees' negligent actions.

2. **Encouraging Diligence**: By holding Sparkling Bright liable for the damage caused by Sam's negligence, the court would encourage service providers to exercise reasonable diligence in their operations. This aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which emphasize the importance of fulfilling contractual obligations with due care.

3. **Fairness to Clients**: Allowing Sparkling Bright to escape liability under the ambiguous exclusion clause would be unfair to S&A, who suffered a loss due to Sparkling Bright's negligence. Construing the clause contra proferentem ensures that any ambiguity is resolved in favor of the client, promoting fairness in contractual relationships.

4. **Commercial Reasonableness**: The decision would uphold the principle that exclusion clauses should not cover entirely preventable acts of negligence. This maintains a balance between allowing parties to limit their liability and ensuring that such limitations are not used to avoid responsibility for negligent conduct.

Therefore, Sparkling Bright cannot successfully resist S&A’s demand for compensation for the laptop. The exclusion clause in the WMA standard conditions does not exclude liability for damages that could have been prevented with reasonable diligence, as established in the precedent case.

Regarding the demand to resume weekly cleanings, Sparkling Bright should comply with S&A's request. The temporary reduction in cleaning frequency was conditional on the office remaining "spick and span." Given the incident and the upcoming important guests, it is reasonable for S&A to insist on the original cleaning schedule to ensure their premises are adequately maintained.

In conclusion, Sparkling Bright should compensate S&A for the damaged laptop and resume weekly cleanings as per the original agreement.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the explicit reference to the WMA standard conditions in the verification sheet signed by S&A’s office manager, that was not present in HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of exclusion clauses and their interpretation.

In the precedent case, the exclusion clause was part of the contract and was subject to the contra proferentem rule due to its ambiguity. However, in our current case, the WMA standard conditions were explicitly referenced in the verification sheet signed by S&A’s office manager, which could be argued to constitute an acknowledgment and acceptance of those terms by S&A.

Because of this explicit reference and acknowledgment, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences than positive ones. Specifically, it would undermine the principle of freedom of contract, where parties are free to agree on their terms, including exclusion clauses, provided they are clearly communicated and accepted. Unlike in HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE, where the exclusion clause was ambiguous and not clearly communicated, the explicit reference in our case suggests that S&A had the opportunity to review and understand the WMA standard conditions.

Therefore, the presence of this explicit reference and acknowledgment in our current case significantly alters the balance of positive and negative effects, making it less appropriate to apply the same outcome as in the precedent case.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE should be stated as: "When both an exclusion clause attempting to limit liability for damages caused by the service provider's employees and an explicit reference to the standard conditions in a signed document are present, the court should decide that the exclusion clause is valid and enforceable." Omitting the explicit reference to the standard conditions from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of undermining the principle of freedom of contract. Indeed, the opinion in HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE explicitly states that exclusion clauses must be construed contra proferentem due to their ambiguity. However, in our current case, the explicit reference in the verification sheet signed by S&A’s office manager suggests that S&A had the opportunity to review and understand the WMA standard conditions, thus making the exclusion clause clear and enforceable.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of service providers escaping liability for preventable acts of negligence due to ambiguous exclusion clauses. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because the explicit reference to the WMA standard conditions in the verification sheet signed by S&A’s office manager makes the exclusion clause clear and unambiguous. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The explicit reference and acknowledgment of the WMA standard conditions by S&A indicate that they were aware of and accepted the terms, including the exclusion clause. Thus, Sparkling Bright can successfully resist S&A’s demand for compensation for the laptop based on the valid and enforceable exclusion clause.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the explicit reference to the WMA standard conditions in the original contract, which was present in the precedent case HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE, requiring this factor for all similar cases of exclusion clauses would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would allow service providers to escape liability for preventable acts of negligence simply by including a reference to standard conditions in a secondary document, which may not be adequately communicated or understood by the client. Conversely, not requiring this explicit reference in the original contract would allow for a more equitable outcome, ensuring that exclusion clauses are only enforceable when they are clearly communicated and understood by both parties. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which emphasize fairness, transparency, and the importance of mutual understanding in contractual agreements.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the explicit reference to the WMA standard conditions in the original contract, which was present in HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE, we have the additional factor of the verification sheet signed by S&A’s office manager. This verification sheet, which included a reference to the WMA standard conditions, serves a similar function to the explicit reference in the original contract in the precedent case. Given the presence of this verification sheet, we submit that the reasoning in HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE still applies, as the positive effects on promoting accountability, encouraging diligence, and ensuring fairness in contractual relationships would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. Therefore, Sparkling Bright cannot successfully resist S&A’s demand for compensation for the laptop based on the valid and enforceable exclusion clause.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in the context of exclusion clauses and the application of the contra proferentem rule. However, it also differs in a significant way: the explicit reference to the WMA standard conditions in the verification sheet signed by S&A’s office manager.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case suggests that exclusion clauses should not cover entirely preventable acts of negligence and must be construed contra proferentem. This rule finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the explicit reference to the WMA standard conditions in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides. On one hand, the initial analogy emphasizes the importance of holding service providers accountable for preventable acts of negligence, promoting diligence and fairness in contractual relationships. On the other hand, the rebuttal arguments highlight the principle of freedom of contract and the significance of explicit references to standard conditions, suggesting that parties should be bound by terms they have acknowledged and accepted.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, transparency, and mutual understanding in contractual agreements, as well as the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Sparkling Bright cannot successfully resist S&A’s demand for compensation for the laptop. The exclusion clause in the WMA standard conditions does not exclude liability for damages that could have been prevented with reasonable diligence, as established in the precedent case. The explicit reference in the verification sheet does not sufficiently alter this conclusion, as it does not negate the requirement for reasonable diligence and accountability for preventable acts of negligence.

Regarding the demand to resume weekly cleanings, Sparkling Bright should comply with S&A's request. The temporary reduction in cleaning frequency was conditional on the office remaining "spick and span." Given the incident and the upcoming important guests, it is reasonable for S&A to insist on the original cleaning schedule to ensure their premises are adequately maintained.

In conclusion, Sparkling Bright should compensate S&A for the damaged laptop and resume weekly cleanings as per the original agreement. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency, promoting accountability and diligence among service providers.

### Major Premise:

1. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 8 Subsection 1

   Conditions:
   - A person deals as consumer
   - The other party to a contract for the supply of a service attempts to exclude or restrict any liability arising under the contract by virtue of the Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance (Cap. 457)

   Consequences:
   - The other party cannot exclude or restrict any liability arising under the contract by reference to any contract term

   Exceptions:
   - None

2. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 8 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - A person deals otherwise than as consumer
   - A right, duty or liability would arise under a contract for the supply of a service by virtue of the Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance (Cap. 457)

   Consequences:
   - The right, duty or liability may be negatived or varied by express agreement, or by the course of dealing between the parties, or by such usage as binds both parties to the contract

   Exceptions:
   - None

4. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 7 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - A person attempts to exclude or restrict liability for negligence by reference to any contract term or notice given to persons generally or to particular persons
   - The liability is for other loss or damage resulting from negligence

   - A contract term or notice purports to exclude or restrict liability for negligence
   - A person agrees to or is aware of the contract term or notice

   Consequences:
   - The person's agreement to or awareness of the contract term or notice is not of itself to be taken as indicating his voluntary acceptance of any risk

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 8 Subsection 1:
   - S&A is a business entity and not a consumer.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

2. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 8 Subsection 2:
   - S&A deals otherwise than as consumer.
   - A right, duty or liability would arise under the contract for the supply of cleaning services.
   - The WMA standard conditions attempt to exclude liability for damages or losses caused by the service provider’s employees.
   - The Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 71) applies, so this section is subject to its provisions.

3. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 7 Subsection 1:
   - The liability in question is for property damage, not death or personal injury.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

4. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 7 Subsection 2:
   - Sparkling Bright attempts to exclude liability for negligence by reference to the WMA standard conditions.
   - The liability is for property damage resulting from negligence.
   - The exclusion clause must satisfy the requirement of reasonableness to be effective.

5. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 7 Subsection 3:
   - The WMA standard conditions purport to exclude liability for negligence.
   - S&A’s office manager signed the verification sheet, which referenced the WMA conditions.
   - However, S&A’s awareness of the WMA conditions does not indicate voluntary acceptance of the risk.

### Conclusion:

The exclusion clause in the WMA standard conditions must satisfy the requirement of reasonableness under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 71) Section 7 Subsection 2. Given that the clause was printed in small font on a verification sheet and not explicitly agreed upon in the main contract, it is unlikely to be considered reasonable. Therefore, Sparkling Bright cannot successfully resist S&A’s demand for compensation for the laptop. Additionally, the demand to resume weekly cleanings is a separate contractual obligation that Sparkling Bright must adhere to, as the temporary reduction was conditional and not a permanent amendment to the contract.

## Deductive Reasoning: cfa

### Relevant law:

Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, Cap 71

### Major Premise:

1. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, Cap 71

   Conditions:
   - An exemption clause is part of the contract.
   - The clause is subject to the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, Cap 71.
   - The clause must pass the 'reasonableness' test in section 3.

   Consequences:
   - The exemption clause is enforceable.

   Exceptions:
   - The clause fails the 'reasonableness' test.

   Citation:
   - FACV000004/1997 Bewise Motors Co. Ltd. v Hoi Kong Container Services Ltd.

### Minor Premise:

1. An exemption clause is part of the contract:
   - The verification sheet signed by S&A’s office manager included a reference to the WMA standard conditions, which contain an exemption clause relieving service providers from liability for damages or losses caused by their employees.

2. The clause is subject to the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, Cap 71:
   - The exemption clause in the WMA standard conditions is subject to the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, Cap 71, as it seeks to limit liability for negligence.

3. The clause must pass the 'reasonableness' test in section 3:
   - The 'reasonableness' test considers factors such as the bargaining power of the parties, whether the clause was brought to the attention of the other party, and whether it is fair and reasonable in the circumstances.

### Analysis:

- **Bargaining Power**: S&A is a prominent consulting firm, and Sparkling Bright is a local cleaning outfit. There is no indication of significant disparity in bargaining power.
- **Notice**: The exemption clause was included in the WMA standard conditions, referenced in small print on the verification sheet. It is questionable whether this provided adequate notice to S&A.
- **Fairness**: The clause seeks to exclude liability for any damages or losses, which may be considered overly broad and potentially unfair, especially given the nature of the damage (a laptop ruined due to negligence).

### Conclusion:

The exemption clause in the WMA standard conditions is likely to fail the 'reasonableness' test under section 3 of the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, Cap 71. Therefore, Sparkling Bright cannot rely on this clause to resist S&A’s demand for compensation for the laptop.

### Decision:

Sparkling Bright cannot successfully resist S&A’s demand for compensation for the laptop. However, the demand to resume weekly cleanings immediately is a separate contractual issue and would depend on the specific terms of the agreement and the correspondence between the parties. Given that S&A agreed to the reduced cleaning frequency "so long as the office remains spick and span," and considering the damage incident, S&A may have grounds to demand the resumption of weekly cleanings.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCMP 2483/2011)
In the case of HCMP 2483/2011 BETWEEN LEE YUK SHING Plaintiff And DIANOOR INTERNATIONAL LIMITED (In Liquidation) Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the exclusion clause in the contract did not exclude liability for misdescription as to the nature of the goods, despite the clause stating that goods were sold "as is, where is, with all faults." The court found that such exclusion clauses must be clear and unambiguous, and in the context of the sale of jewellery and rough diamond stones, the term "description" was interpreted to mean description as to quality and quantity, not the nature of the goods.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCMP 2483/2011 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Exclusion Clauses**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCMP 2483/2011, the exclusion clause attempted to limit liability for misdescription. In our current case, the WMA standard conditions include a term that relieves service providers from liability for damages or losses caused by their employees.
- **Legal Concept 2: Reasonableness Test under Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCMP 2483/2011, the court considered whether the exclusion clause was reasonable under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance. In our current case, the reasonableness of the WMA standard conditions under the same Ordinance is in question.
- **Legal Concept 3: Clarity and Ambiguity of Contract Terms**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCMP 2483/2011, the court emphasized that exclusion clauses must be clear and unambiguous. In our current case, the term in the verification sheet referring to WMA conditions is printed in small font and may not be clear to the client.
- **Legal Concept 4: Factual Matrix and Business Commonsense**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCMP 2483/2011, the court considered the factual matrix and business commonsense in interpreting the exclusion clause. In our current case, the factual matrix includes the ongoing business relationship and the specific context of the cleaning services provided.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCMP 2483/2011)
This suggests a general rule that when we see fact pattern i* (an exclusion clause attempting to limit liability for damages or misdescription), the court should decide outcome o (the exclusion clause must be clear and unambiguous, and its reasonableness must be assessed under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance). This rule was justified in HCMP 2483/2011 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring clarity and fairness in contractual terms and protecting parties from unreasonable exclusions outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially limiting the freedom to contract.

In applying this rule to our current case, Sparkling Bright may face difficulty in successfully resisting S&A’s demands based on the WMA standard conditions. The term in the verification sheet referring to these conditions is not clear and unambiguous, and its reasonableness under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance may be questioned. Therefore, Sparkling Bright may not be able to rely on the exclusion clause to avoid liability for the damaged laptop. Additionally, the agreement to reduce cleaning frequency was conditional on maintaining the office's cleanliness, which may require resuming weekly cleanings as demanded by S&A.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCMP 2483/2011) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Exclusion Clauses**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCMP 2483/2011, the exclusion clause attempted to limit liability for misdescription. In our current case, the WMA standard conditions include a term that relieves service providers from liability for damages or losses caused by their employees.

- **Legal Concept 2: Reasonableness Test under Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCMP 2483/2011, the court considered whether the exclusion clause was reasonable under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance. In our current case, the reasonableness of the WMA standard conditions under the same Ordinance is in question.

- **Legal Concept 3: Clarity and Ambiguity of Contract Terms**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCMP 2483/2011, the court emphasized that exclusion clauses must be clear and unambiguous. In our current case, the term in the verification sheet referring to WMA conditions is printed in small font and may not be clear to the client.

- **Legal Concept 4: Factual Matrix and Business Commonsense**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCMP 2483/2011, the court considered the factual matrix and business commonsense in interpreting the exclusion clause. In our current case, the factual matrix includes the ongoing business relationship and the specific context of the cleaning services provided.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCMP 2483/2011. This decision would be justified because, as in HCMP 2483/2011, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Clarity and Fairness in Contractual Terms**: Just as in the precedent case, requiring exclusion clauses to be clear and unambiguous ensures that all parties are fully aware of their rights and obligations. This promotes fairness and transparency in contractual relationships.

2. **Protecting Parties from Unreasonable Exclusions**: The reasonableness test under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance serves to protect parties from unfair and unreasonable exclusion clauses. This is particularly important in cases where one party may have less bargaining power or where terms are hidden in small print.

3. **Promoting Business Commonsense**: Interpreting exclusion clauses in a manner consistent with business commonsense ensures that contracts are practical and reflect the true intentions of the parties. In our current case, it would be unreasonable to expect S&A to have accepted a term that absolves Sparkling Bright of all liability for damages caused by its employees, especially when such a term was not clearly communicated.

4. **Maintaining Trust in Commercial Transactions**: Upholding these principles helps maintain trust in commercial transactions. Businesses are more likely to engage in contracts when they can trust that exclusion clauses will be scrutinized for fairness and clarity.

Given these positive effects, the court should find that the exclusion clause in the WMA standard conditions is not reasonable under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance and that it is not clear and unambiguous. Therefore, Sparkling Bright may not be able to rely on this clause to avoid liability for the damaged laptop. Additionally, the agreement to reduce cleaning frequency was conditional on maintaining the office's cleanliness, which may require resuming weekly cleanings as demanded by S&A.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCMP 2483/2011, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the factual matrix and business commonsense surrounding the sale of jewellery and rough diamond stones by a reputable international business. This factual matrix was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—such as ensuring clarity and fairness in contractual terms and protecting parties from unreasonable exclusions—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided a clear context in which the exclusion clause was interpreted. However, in our current case, this crucial factual matrix of a reputable international business selling high-value items is notably absent. Instead, the current case involves a service agreement for cleaning offices, which does not carry the same level of expectation regarding the nature of the goods or services provided.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—the ongoing business relationship and the specific context of the cleaning services provided—that was not present in HCMP 2483/2011. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of exclusion clauses and their reasonableness. Because of the ongoing business relationship and the specific context of the cleaning services, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as undermining the trust and expectations in service agreements, than positive ones. Unlike in HCMP 2483/2011, where the exclusion clause was scrutinized in the context of a one-time sale of high-value items, the current case involves a continuous service relationship where the expectations and reliance on the service provider's performance are more pronounced. Therefore, the presence of this ongoing relationship and context means that the exclusion clause in the WMA standard conditions should be interpreted with greater scrutiny to ensure fairness and reasonableness in the service agreement.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCMP 2483/2011 should be stated as 'When both [an exclusion clause attempting to limit liability for damages or misdescription] and [the factual matrix and business commonsense surrounding the sale of high-value items by a reputable international business] are present, the court should decide [that the exclusion clause must be clear and unambiguous, and its reasonableness must be assessed under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance].' Omitting [the factual matrix and business commonsense surrounding the sale of high-value items by a reputable international business] from this rule could lead to [an undesirable consequence where exclusion clauses in service agreements are scrutinized with the same rigor as those in high-value sales, potentially undermining the trust and expectations in ongoing service relationships]. Indeed, the opinion in HCMP 2483/2011 explicitly states that [the factual matrix and business commonsense were crucial to their decision, as it provided a clear context in which the exclusion clause was interpreted].

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCMP 2483/2011 was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties being misled by unclear and unreasonable exclusion clauses in high-value sales transactions]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [parties being misled in the same manner, as the context involves an ongoing service relationship rather than a one-time high-value sale]. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The ongoing business relationship and the specific context of the cleaning services provided require a different approach to ensure fairness and reasonableness in the service agreement.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factual matrix and business commonsense surrounding the sale of high-value items by a reputable international business, which was present in the precedent case HCMP 2483/2011, requiring this factor for all similar cases of exclusion clauses attempting to limit liability for damages or misdescription would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would mean that exclusion clauses in service agreements, which are often ongoing and involve continuous relationships, would not be scrutinized with the same rigor, potentially allowing service providers to evade liability for damages caused by their negligence. Conversely, not requiring the high-value sale context would allow for a more consistent application of the principles of clarity, fairness, and reasonableness in exclusion clauses across different types of contracts. This better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, which aim to protect parties from unfair and unreasonable exclusion clauses and ensure transparency and fairness in contractual relationships.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factual matrix and business commonsense surrounding the sale of high-value items by a reputable international business, which was present in HCMP 2483/2011, we have the additional factor of an ongoing business relationship and the specific context of the cleaning services provided. This ongoing relationship, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of exclusion clauses and their reasonableness, serves a similar function to the high-value sale context in the precedent case. Given the presence of this ongoing relationship, we submit that the reasoning in HCMP 2483/2011 still applies, as the positive effects on ensuring clarity and fairness in contractual terms, protecting parties from unreasonable exclusions, and maintaining trust in commercial transactions would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCMP 2483/2011, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of an exclusion clause attempting to limit liability for damages and the need to assess the reasonableness of such clauses under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the context of an ongoing service relationship rather than a one-time high-value sale.

The proposed legal rule that exclusion clauses must be clear and unambiguous, and their reasonableness must be assessed under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in the context of ongoing service agreements where the expectations and reliance on the service provider's performance are more pronounced.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the need for clarity and fairness in contractual terms (as emphasized in HCMP 2483/2011) and the specific context of the ongoing business relationship in the current case. Considering the underlying legal principles of ensuring transparency, fairness, and reasonableness in exclusion clauses, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the exclusion clause in the WMA standard conditions is not reasonable under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance and is not clear and unambiguous.

Therefore, Sparkling Bright may not be able to rely on this clause to avoid liability for the damaged laptop. Additionally, the agreement to reduce cleaning frequency was conditional on maintaining the office's cleanliness, which may require resuming weekly cleanings as demanded by S&A.

This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by ensuring that exclusion clauses in service agreements are scrutinized for fairness and clarity, thereby protecting parties from unreasonable exclusions and maintaining trust in commercial transactions.

### Minor Premise:

1. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 7 Subsection 2:
   - S&A deals as a consumer with Sparkling Bright.
   - The WMA standard conditions include a term that excludes liability for negligence resulting in other loss or damage (the ruined laptop).
   - The exclusion or restriction of liability is only enforceable if it satisfies the requirement of reasonableness.
   - The term was not explicitly agreed upon in the original contract but was included in the verification sheet in small print, which may not satisfy the requirement of reasonableness.

2. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 8 Subsection 2:
   - S&A deals as a consumer with Sparkling Bright.
   - The WMA standard conditions include a term that excludes liability for breach of contract (failure to provide weekly cleaning).
   - The exclusion or restriction of liability is only enforceable if it satisfies the requirement of reasonableness.
   - The term was not explicitly agreed upon in the original contract but was included in the verification sheet in small print, which may not satisfy the requirement of reasonableness.

### Conclusion:

The exclusion clause in the WMA standard conditions is unlikely to be incorporated into the original contract between Sparkling Bright and S&A because it was not explicitly agreed upon and was included in the verification sheet in small print, which may not satisfy the requirement of reasonableness. Therefore, Sparkling Bright cannot successfully resist S&A’s demands for compensation for the ruined laptop and the resumption of weekly cleanings.

### Relevant law:

SZE FUNG ENGINEERING LTD v. TREVI CONSTRUCTION CO LTD [2023] HKCFI 419  
Yun Kwan Construction Engineering Ltd v Shui Tai Construction Engineering Co Ltd [2019] HKCFI 1841

### Major Premise:

1. SZE FUNG ENGINEERING LTD v. TREVI CONSTRUCTION CO LTD [2023] HKCFI 419

   Conditions:
   - The contract attempts to incorporate provisions of another contract or standard terms by reference
   - The reference is sufficiently explicit and clear
   - The terms sought to be incorporated are identifiable and available to the parties

   Consequences:
   - The provisions of the other contract or standard terms may be incorporated into the original contract

   Exceptions:
   - The reference is vague or general
   - The terms cannot be incorporated without modification
   - The terms are not clearly identified or available to the parties

2. Yun Kwan Construction Engineering Ltd v Shui Tai Construction Engineering Co Ltd [2019] HKCFI 1841

   Conditions:
   - There is a reference in a contract to any document containing an arbitration clause
   - The reference is such as to make that clause part of the contract

   Consequences:
   - The arbitration clause is incorporated into the contract

   Exceptions:
   - The reference is not sufficient to make the arbitration clause part of the contract
   - The parties did not intend to incorporate the arbitration clause

### Minor Premise:

1. SZE FUNG ENGINEERING LTD v. TREVI CONSTRUCTION CO LTD [2023] HKCFI 419:
- The contract between Sparkling Bright and S&A is silent on liability for property damage.
- The verification sheet signed by S&A’s office manager contains a reference to the WMA standard conditions.
- The reference to the WMA standard conditions is explicit and clear, stating “All services provided under standard WMA conditions. Copies available on request.”
- The WMA standard conditions are identifiable and available online.

   Exceptions:
   - The reference is not vague or general.
   - The terms can be incorporated without modification.
   - The terms are clearly identified and available to the parties.

2. Yun Kwan Construction Engineering Ltd v Shui Tai Construction Engineering Co Ltd [2019] HKCFI 1841:
- There is no specific reference to an arbitration clause in the scenario.
- Therefore, this case law is not directly applicable to the current issue.

### Conclusion:

The exclusion clause in the WMA standard conditions can be incorporated into the original contract between Sparkling Bright and S&A. Therefore, Sparkling Bright can successfully resist S&A’s demand for compensation for the damaged laptop based on the exclusion clause in the WMA standard conditions. However, the demand to resume weekly cleanings immediately is a separate issue and would depend on the terms of the temporary agreement to reduce the frequency of cleanings, which is not covered by the exclusion clause.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (SZE FUNG ENGINEERING LTD v. TREVI CONSTRUCTION CO LTD)

In the case of SZE FUNG ENGINEERING LTD v. TREVI CONSTRUCTION CO LTD (precedent p), the court was asked to determine whether a "pay-when-paid" clause in a subcontract was sufficiently clear and unambiguous to be enforceable. The court ruled that for such clauses to be enforceable, they must be expressed in clear and precise terms. The court found that Item 18 of the Quotation was clear and unequivocal in providing for payment to be made on a back-to-back basis, meaning that payment to the subcontractor would only be made upon receipt of payment from the main contractor.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in SZE FUNG ENGINEERING LTD v. TREVI CONSTRUCTION CO LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Incorporation of Terms by Reference**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In SZE FUNG, the court examined whether the terms of a subcontract (Clause 18) were incorporated into the agreement through a reference in the Quotation. In our current case, the issue is whether the WMA standard conditions, referenced in the verification sheet, are incorporated into the original contract between Sparkling Bright and S&A.

- **Legal Concept 2: Clarity and Precision of Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** The court in SZE FUNG emphasized that terms must be clear and unambiguous to be enforceable. Similarly, in our current case, the clarity and precision of the reference to the WMA standard conditions in the verification sheet are in question.

- **Legal Concept 3: Post-Contractual Conduct**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In SZE FUNG, the court considered the conduct of the parties after the agreement to support the existence of the disputed term. In our current case, the conduct of Sparkling Bright and S&A, such as the acceptance of reduced cleaning frequency and the subsequent demand for compensation, may be relevant.

- **Legal Concept 4: Reasonableness and Commercial Risk**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** The court in SZE FUNG discussed the reasonableness of a subcontractor assuming commercial risk under a "pay-when-paid" clause. In our current case, the reasonableness of S&A assuming the risk of damage under the WMA standard conditions is at issue.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (SZE FUNG ENGINEERING LTD v. TREVI CONSTRUCTION CO LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern involving the incorporation of terms by reference, the court should decide that such terms are enforceable only if they are expressed in clear and precise terms. This rule was justified in SZE FUNG ENGINEERING LTD v. TREVI CONSTRUCTION CO LTD because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring clarity and certainty in contractual obligations outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially excluding terms that were not clearly communicated to all parties.

Applying this rule to our current case, Sparkling Bright can argue that the reference to the WMA standard conditions in the verification sheet was not sufficiently clear and precise to be incorporated into the original contract with S&A. Therefore, Sparkling Bright can resist S&A’s demand for compensation for the damaged laptop by asserting that the exclusion clause in the WMA standard conditions was not part of the original agreement. Additionally, the demand for resuming weekly cleanings can be resisted on the basis that the temporary reduction was mutually agreed upon and did not alter the original terms of the contract.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (SZE FUNG ENGINEERING LTD v. TREVI CONSTRUCTION CO LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Incorporation of Terms by Reference**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In SZE FUNG, the court examined whether the terms of a subcontract (Clause 18) were incorporated into the agreement through a reference in the Quotation. In our current case, the issue is whether the WMA standard conditions, referenced in the verification sheet, are incorporated into the original contract between Sparkling Bright and S&A.

- **Legal Concept 2: Clarity and Precision of Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** The court in SZE FUNG emphasized that terms must be clear and unambiguous to be enforceable. Similarly, in our current case, the clarity and precision of the reference to the WMA standard conditions in the verification sheet are in question.

- **Legal Concept 3: Post-Contractual Conduct**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In SZE FUNG, the court considered the conduct of the parties after the agreement to support the existence of the disputed term. In our current case, the conduct of Sparkling Bright and S&A, such as the acceptance of reduced cleaning frequency and the subsequent demand for compensation, may be relevant.

- **Legal Concept 4: Reasonableness and Commercial Risk**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** The court in SZE FUNG discussed the reasonableness of a subcontractor assuming commercial risk under a "pay-when-paid" clause. In our current case, the reasonableness of S&A assuming the risk of damage under the WMA standard conditions is at issue.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in SZE FUNG ENGINEERING LTD v. TREVI CONSTRUCTION CO LTD. This decision would be justified because, as in SZE FUNG, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Clarity and Certainty in Contractual Obligations:** Just as in SZE FUNG, enforcing the requirement for clear and precise terms ensures that all parties are fully aware of their obligations and liabilities. This promotes fairness and reduces the likelihood of disputes arising from ambiguous terms.

2. **Protecting Parties from Unfair Surprise:** By requiring that exclusion clauses and other significant terms be clearly communicated, the court protects parties from being unfairly bound by terms they were not adequately informed about. In our case, S&A should not be bound by the WMA standard conditions if they were not clearly incorporated into the original agreement.

3. **Encouraging Proper Contract Drafting:** Upholding the need for clear and precise terms encourages parties to draft their contracts carefully and to ensure that all significant terms are explicitly agreed upon. This leads to better business practices and more reliable contractual relationships.

4. **Balancing Commercial Risks Fairly:** The court's approach in SZE FUNG ensures that commercial risks are allocated fairly and transparently. In our case, it would be unreasonable for S&A to assume the risk of damage without clear and explicit agreement to that effect.

Therefore, Sparkling Bright can successfully resist S&A’s demand for compensation for the damaged laptop by asserting that the exclusion clause in the WMA standard conditions was not part of the original agreement. Additionally, the demand for resuming weekly cleanings can be resisted on the basis that the temporary reduction was mutually agreed upon and did not alter the original terms of the contract.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case SZE FUNG ENGINEERING LTD v. TREVI CONSTRUCTION CO LTD, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the clear and unequivocal language used in Item 18 of the Quotation. This clarity was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—such as ensuring clarity and certainty in contractual obligations—outweighed any potential drawbacks, such as the risk of non-payment to the subcontractor. However, in our current case, this crucial clarity and precision in language is notably absent. The reference to the WMA standard conditions in the verification sheet was printed in small font and was not explicitly discussed or agreed upon by both parties at the time of the original contract. This lack of clear and precise terms makes it difficult to argue that the exclusion clause was effectively incorporated into the original agreement.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—the post-contractual conduct of the parties—that was not present in SZE FUNG ENGINEERING LTD v. TREVI CONSTRUCTION CO LTD. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern. In our case, Sparkling Bright and S&A had subsequent communications and agreements regarding the reduction of cleaning frequency and the specific attention to be given to S&A’s offices. This post-contractual conduct indicates a mutual understanding and agreement that may not align with the original terms of the contract. Due to this post-contractual conduct, applying the same outcome as in SZE FUNG would have more negative consequences, such as undermining the mutual agreements made after the original contract, than positive ones. This is because the subsequent agreements and conduct between Sparkling Bright and S&A suggest a different understanding and expectation regarding the services provided, which should be taken into account.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from SZE FUNG ENGINEERING LTD v. TREVI CONSTRUCTION CO LTD should be stated as: "When both the incorporation of terms by reference and the clarity and precision of those terms are present, the court should decide that such terms are enforceable." Omitting the requirement for clarity and precision from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of parties being bound by terms they were not adequately informed about, leading to unfair surprise and potential disputes. Indeed, the opinion in SZE FUNG ENGINEERING LTD v. TREVI CONSTRUCTION CO LTD explicitly states that the clarity and precision of the terms were crucial to their decision, as the court emphasized the need for clear and unambiguous language to enforce such terms.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in SZE FUNG ENGINEERING LTD v. TREVI CONSTRUCTION CO LTD was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of parties being unfairly bound by ambiguous or unclear terms, which could lead to disputes and uncertainty in contractual obligations. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence occurring because the reference to the WMA standard conditions in the verification sheet was not clear and precise. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—to ensure clarity and prevent unfair surprise—is not relevant to our situation. The lack of clear and precise terms in the current case means that the exclusion clause in the WMA standard conditions should not be considered incorporated into the original contract between Sparkling Bright and S&A.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction

While it's true that our case lacks the clear and precise language (factor m) that was present in the precedent case SZE FUNG ENGINEERING LTD v. TREVI CONSTRUCTION CO LTD, requiring this factor for all similar cases of incorporation of terms by reference would lead to the undesirable consequence of parties being unfairly bound by terms they were not adequately informed about. Conversely, not requiring such clear and precise language would allow for a more equitable outcome, ensuring that parties are only bound by terms they have clearly agreed to, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and transparency in contract law.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution

Although our case lacks the clear and precise language (factor m) that was present in SZE FUNG ENGINEERING LTD v. TREVI CONSTRUCTION CO LTD, we have the additional factor of post-contractual conduct (factor n). This post-contractual conduct, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of incorporation of terms by reference, serves a similar function to the clear and precise language in the precedent case. Given the presence of post-contractual conduct, we submit that the reasoning in SZE FUNG ENGINEERING LTD v. TREVI CONSTRUCTION CO LTD still applies, as the positive effects on ensuring clarity and fairness in contractual obligations would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to SZE FUNG ENGINEERING LTD v. TREVI CONSTRUCTION CO LTD, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in the legal concepts of incorporation of terms by reference, clarity and precision of terms, post-contractual conduct, and reasonableness and commercial risk. However, it also differs in significant ways, notably the lack of clear and precise language in the reference to the WMA standard conditions and the post-contractual conduct between Sparkling Bright and S&A.

The proposed legal rule from SZE FUNG ENGINEERING LTD v. TREVI CONSTRUCTION CO LTD—that terms incorporated by reference must be clear and precise to be enforceable—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in the context of ensuring fairness and transparency in contractual obligations.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the reference to the WMA standard conditions in the verification sheet was not sufficiently clear and precise to be incorporated into the original contract (Step 5), and the counterargument that post-contractual conduct indicates a mutual understanding that may not align with the original terms of the contract (Step 9).

Considering the underlying legal principles of ensuring clarity and certainty in contractual obligations, protecting parties from unfair surprise, and encouraging proper contract drafting, we conclude that Sparkling Bright can successfully resist S&A’s demand for compensation for the damaged laptop. The exclusion clause in the WMA standard conditions was not part of the original agreement due to the lack of clear and precise terms. Additionally, the demand for resuming weekly cleanings can be resisted on the basis that the temporary reduction was mutually agreed upon and did not alter the original terms of the contract.

Therefore, the decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency. The key factors influencing this outcome include the absence of clear and precise language in the reference to the WMA standard conditions and the mutual agreement on the temporary reduction of cleaning frequency.

### Final Conclusion:

Sparkling Bright can successfully resist S&A’s two demands based on the following conclusions:
1. The reduction in cleaning frequency does not constitute a variation of the original contract that requires third-party consent or court intervention.
2. The variation in cleaning frequency is valid as agreed upon by both parties without any special resolution.
3. The WMA standard conditions, referenced in the verification sheet, relieve Sparkling Bright from liability for damages caused by its employees, including the damage to the laptop.

Therefore, Sparkling Bright is not liable for the damage to the laptop and is not obligated to resume weekly cleanings immediately.

Wu Kit Man v Dragonway Group Holdings Limited

### Major Premise:

1. Chong Cheng Lin Courtney v Cathay Pacific Airways Limited

   Conditions:
   - The parties agree to vary the contract of employment by new terms
   - There is adequate consideration to support the agreement to vary

   Consequences:
   - The new terms become part of the contract of employment

   Exceptions:
   - There is no adequate consideration to support the variation

2. Wu Kit Man v Dragonway Group Holdings Limited

   Conditions:
   - There is a variation of terms of employment
   - The employee refrains from resigning
   - The employer obtains a real benefit or obviates a disbenefit
   - The promise is not given as a result of economic duress or fraud

   Consequences:
   - The variation of terms of employment can be supported by consideration

   Exceptions:
   - The variation lacks commercial sense
   - The overall circumstances do not justify the conclusion that the continuance in employment provided a real benefit to the employer

### Minor Premise:

1. Chong Cheng Lin Courtney v Cathay Pacific Airways Limited:
   - Sparkling Bright and S&A agreed to vary the contract by reducing the frequency of deep cleanings to fortnightly.
   - S&A's acceptance of the reduced level of services for the rest of 2020, provided the office remains "spick and span," constitutes adequate consideration as it implies a conditional acceptance based on performance.

   Therefore, the new terms (fortnightly cleaning) become part of the contract of employment.

2. Wu Kit Man v Dragonway Group Holdings Limited:
   - There is a variation of terms of employment (reduction in cleaning frequency).
   - Sparkling Bright refrains from terminating the contract with S&A.
   - Sparkling Bright obtains a real benefit by being able to assure its other long-standing customers that there would be no change to their cleaning schedules.
   - The promise was not given as a result of economic duress or fraud.

   - The variation does not lack commercial sense as it allows Sparkling Bright to manage its resources better.
   - The overall circumstances justify the conclusion that the continuance in employment provided a real benefit to Sparkling Bright.

   Therefore, the variation of terms of employment can be supported by consideration.

### Conclusion:

1. **Reduction in Cleaning Frequency:**
   The reduction in cleaning frequency constitutes a valid variation of the original contract. Sparkling Bright can successfully resist S&A's demand to resume weekly cleanings immediately, as the new terms (fortnightly cleaning) have become part of the contract.

2. **Liability for Damaged Laptop:**
   The term in the verification sheet referring to the WMA conditions, which includes a clause relieving Sparkling Bright from liability for damages, is likely to be considered an unfair term if it was not explicitly agreed upon by S&A at the time of the original contract. Given that the original contract was silent on liability for property damage, and the verification sheet's terms were not clearly communicated or agreed upon, Sparkling Bright may not be able to rely on this clause to avoid liability for the damaged laptop.

   Therefore, Sparkling Bright may not successfully resist S&A's demand for compensation for the laptop.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (CACV 7/2010 BETWEEN CHONG CHENG LIN COURTNEY Plaintiff (Respondent) and CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LIMITED Defendant (Appellant))
In the case of CACV 7/2010 BETWEEN CHONG CHENG LIN COURTNEY Plaintiff (Respondent) and CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LIMITED Defendant (Appellant) (precedent p), the court ruled that the RTB (Retirement Travel Benefits) provisions contained in the 1991 Handbook were intended to have contractual force and were not merely discretionary benefits. The court found that these provisions had been incorporated into the contract of employment through variation, supported by adequate consideration, and thus had contractual force.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in CACV 7/2010 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Variation of Contract**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In CACV 7/2010, the RTB provisions were not part of the original contract but were later included in the 1991 Handbook, which was considered a variation of the original contract.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 in Current Case**: The reduction in cleaning frequency from weekly to fortnightly was agreed upon in November 2020, which can be seen as a variation of the original contract signed on 8 May 2020.
- **Legal Concept 2: Intention to Create Legal Relations**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In CACV 7/2010, the court found that the RTB provisions were intended to have contractual force, indicating an intention to create legal relations.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 in Current Case**: The correspondence between Sparkling Bright and S&A regarding the reduction in cleaning frequency shows an intention to create legal relations, as S&A agreed to the reduced services under specific conditions.
- **Legal Concept 3: Adequate Consideration**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In CACV 7/2010, the court found that the necessary consideration for the variation was supplied by the employee not leaving Cathay.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 in Current Case**: The consideration for the variation in the current case can be seen in S&A's acceptance of reduced cleaning services in exchange for ensuring the office remains clean, which allowed Sparkling Bright to manage its staff shortage.
- **Legal Concept 4: Incorporation of Terms by Reference**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In CACV 7/2010, the RTB provisions were incorporated into the contract through the Handbook.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 in Current Case**: The verification sheet signed by S&A’s office manager included a reference to the WMA standard conditions, which could be argued to incorporate those terms into the contract.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (CACV 7/2010)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern involving a variation of the original contract terms, an intention to create legal relations, and adequate consideration, the court should decide that the new terms have contractual force. This rule was justified in CACV 7/2010 because the positive effects of recognizing the RTB provisions as contractual terms (ensuring fairness and clarity in employment contracts) outweighed any negative effects (such as the potential for disputes over what constitutes adequate consideration).

Applying this rule to the current case, Sparkling Bright can argue that the reduction in cleaning frequency was a valid variation of the original contract, supported by adequate consideration and an intention to create legal relations. Therefore, Sparkling Bright can resist S&A’s demand to resume weekly cleanings immediately, as the variation was agreed upon by both parties.

Regarding the demand for compensation for the damaged laptop, Sparkling Bright can argue that the WMA standard conditions, referenced in the verification sheet, relieve them from liability for damages caused by their employees. However, given the specific circumstances of the damage (caused by an employee's negligent and unauthorized activity), S&A might challenge the applicability of this exclusion clause.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (CACV 7/2010 BETWEEN CHONG CHENG LIN COURTNEY Plaintiff (Respondent) and CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LIMITED Defendant (Appellant)) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Variation of Contract**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In CACV 7/2010, the RTB provisions were not part of the original contract but were later included in the 1991 Handbook, which was considered a variation of the original contract.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 in Current Case**: The reduction in cleaning frequency from weekly to fortnightly was agreed upon in November 2020, which can be seen as a variation of the original contract signed on 8 May 2020.

- **Legal Concept 2: Intention to Create Legal Relations**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In CACV 7/2010, the court found that the RTB provisions were intended to have contractual force, indicating an intention to create legal relations.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 in Current Case**: The correspondence between Sparkling Bright and S&A regarding the reduction in cleaning frequency shows an intention to create legal relations, as S&A agreed to the reduced services under specific conditions.

- **Legal Concept 3: Adequate Consideration**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In CACV 7/2010, the court found that the necessary consideration for the variation was supplied by the employee not leaving Cathay.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 in Current Case**: The consideration for the variation in the current case can be seen in S&A's acceptance of reduced cleaning services in exchange for ensuring the office remains clean, which allowed Sparkling Bright to manage its staff shortage.

- **Legal Concept 4: Incorporation of Terms by Reference**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In CACV 7/2010, the RTB provisions were incorporated into the contract through the Handbook.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 in Current Case**: The verification sheet signed by S&A’s office manager included a reference to the WMA standard conditions, which could be argued to incorporate those terms into the contract.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in CACV 7/2010, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Fairness and Clarity in Contractual Relationships**: Recognizing the variation in cleaning frequency as a valid contractual modification ensures that both parties' agreements are respected and upheld, promoting fairness and clarity in contractual relationships.

2. **Supporting Business Flexibility**: Allowing variations to be recognized when both parties agree and provide adequate consideration supports business flexibility, enabling companies to adapt to changing circumstances without facing undue legal challenges.

3. **Encouraging Clear Communication and Documentation**: By upholding the incorporation of terms by reference, the decision encourages parties to clearly communicate and document their agreements, reducing the likelihood of disputes and misunderstandings.

4. **Balancing Interests of Both Parties**: The decision balances the interests of both parties by recognizing the agreed-upon variation while also considering the specific circumstances of the damage caused by the employee's negligence.

Therefore, Sparkling Bright can successfully resist S&A’s demand to resume weekly cleanings immediately, as the variation was agreed upon by both parties. Additionally, Sparkling Bright can argue that the WMA standard conditions relieve them from liability for the damaged laptop, although S&A might challenge this based on the specific circumstances of the damage.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case CACV 7/2010 BETWEEN CHONG CHENG LIN COURTNEY Plaintiff (Respondent) and CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LIMITED Defendant (Appellant), the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of a formal document (the 1991 Handbook) that clearly outlined the RTB provisions. This formal document was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling (ensuring fairness and clarity in employment contracts) outweighed any potential drawbacks (such as the potential for disputes over what constitutes adequate consideration) because it provided a clear and unambiguous reference point for the terms being incorporated into the contract. However, in our current case, this crucial formal document is notably absent as the variation in cleaning frequency was agreed upon through informal correspondence rather than a formal, detailed document.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the specific circumstances of the damage caused by the employee's negligence (Sam's TikTok video), that was not present in CACV 7/2010. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces an element of gross negligence and unauthorized activity by the employee. Due to this factor, applying the same outcome (resisting liability for damages) in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the accountability of service providers for their employees' actions than positive ones, unlike in CACV 7/2010 because the precedent case did not involve such egregious conduct by an employee.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from CACV 7/2010 BETWEEN CHONG CHENG LIN COURTNEY Plaintiff (Respondent) and CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LIMITED Defendant (Appellant) should be stated as 'When both the intention to create legal relations and adequate consideration are present, and the terms are incorporated through a formal document, the court should decide that the new terms have contractual force.' Omitting the requirement of a formal document from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of increased uncertainty and disputes over what constitutes a valid contractual variation. Indeed, the opinion in CACV 7/2010 explicitly states that the presence of the 1991 Handbook was crucial to their decision, as it provided a clear and unambiguous reference point for the terms being incorporated into the contract.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in CACV 7/2010 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of uncertainty and disputes over contractual terms by ensuring that variations are documented in a formal and clear manner. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence occurring because the variation in cleaning frequency was agreed upon through clear and documented correspondence between Sparkling Bright and S&A. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule strictly requiring a formal document here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—preventing uncertainty and disputes—is not relevant to our situation given the clear agreement between the parties.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the formal document (factor m), which was present in the precedent case CACV 7/2010 BETWEEN CHONG CHENG LIN COURTNEY Plaintiff (Respondent) and CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LIMITED Defendant (Appellant), requiring this factor for all similar cases of contract variation would lead to the undesirable consequence of inflexibility in contractual relationships. Conversely, not requiring a formal document would allow for greater adaptability and responsiveness to changing circumstances, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, such as the freedom to contract and the ability to modify agreements through mutual consent and clear communication.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the formal document (factor m), which was present in CACV 7/2010, we have the additional factor of clear and documented correspondence (factor n). This clear and documented correspondence, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of mutual agreement and adequate consideration, serves a similar function to the formal document in the precedent case. Given the presence of clear and documented correspondence, we submit that the reasoning in CACV 7/2010 still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as fairness, clarity, and flexibility in contractual relationships would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to CACV 7/2010 BETWEEN CHONG CHENG LIN COURTNEY Plaintiff (Respondent) and CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LIMITED Defendant (Appellant), the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the concepts of variation of contract, intention to create legal relations, and adequate consideration. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of a formal document and the specific circumstances of the damage caused by the employee's negligence.

The proposed legal rule of "When both the intention to create legal relations and adequate consideration are present, and the terms are incorporated through a formal document, the court should decide that the new terms have contractual force" finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the need for flexibility in contractual relationships and the importance of clear documentation to prevent disputes.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, clarity, and flexibility in contractual relationships, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Sparkling Bright can successfully resist S&A’s demand to resume weekly cleanings immediately. The variation in cleaning frequency was agreed upon by both parties through clear and documented correspondence, which serves a similar function to a formal document in this context.

Regarding the demand for compensation for the damaged laptop, while the WMA standard conditions referenced in the verification sheet might relieve Sparkling Bright from liability, the specific circumstances of the damage caused by the employee's gross negligence and unauthorized activity (taking a TikTok video) introduce a significant factor that could undermine the applicability of this exclusion clause. Therefore, Sparkling Bright may not be able to successfully resist S&A’s demand for compensation for the laptop.

In conclusion, Sparkling Bright can resist the demand to resume weekly cleanings immediately but may face challenges in resisting the demand for compensation for the damaged laptop due to the specific circumstances of the employee's negligence. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency.

### Minor Premise:

1. Companies Ordinance Cap. 622 Section 247 Subsection 1:
   - Sparkling Bright is an unlisted company.
   - Sparkling Bright and S&A agreed to a variation of the contract to reduce cleaning frequency.
   - There is no indication that the variation agreement was authorized in advance by special resolution.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

2. Companies Ordinance Cap. 622 Section 247 Subsection 2:
   - There is no indication that the authorization for the variation agreement was conferred, varied, revoked, or renewed by special resolution.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

3. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 6 Subsection 1 and 2:
   - There is no indication that a third party may enforce a term of the contract under section 4.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

4. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 6 Subsection 3 and 4:
   - There is no indication of an express term in the contract that provides for rescinding or varying the contract without the third party's consent.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

### Conclusion:

The variation of the contract to reduce cleaning frequency was not supported by consideration as there is no evidence of a special resolution authorizing the variation agreement. Therefore, Sparkling Bright cannot successfully resist S&A’s demand to resume weekly cleanings immediately.

Regarding the demand for compensation for the damaged laptop, the term in the verification sheet referring to WMA conditions, which relieves Sparkling Bright from liability, is likely not enforceable as it was not explicitly agreed upon in the original contract and was introduced unilaterally after the contract was formed. Therefore, Sparkling Bright is likely liable for the damage caused by its employee.

Sparkling Bright should comply with S&A’s demands to resume weekly cleanings and compensate for the damaged laptop.

### Conclusion:

The variation of the contract to reduce cleaning frequency was supported by consideration and is legally binding and enforceable. Therefore, Sparkling Bright can successfully resist S&A’s demand to resume weekly cleanings immediately.

Regarding the demand for compensation for the damaged laptop, Sparkling Bright may rely on the WMA standard conditions, which were incorporated into the contract through the verification sheet signed by S&A’s office manager. These conditions relieve Sparkling Bright from liability for damages caused by its employees. Therefore, Sparkling Bright can also successfully resist S&A’s demand for compensation for the laptop.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (CACV 7/2010 BETWEEN CHONG CHENG LIN COURTNEY Plaintiff (Respondent) and CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LIMITED Defendant (Appellant))
In the case of CACV 7/2010 BETWEEN CHONG CHENG LIN COURTNEY Plaintiff (Respondent) and CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LIMITED Defendant (Appellant) (precedent p), the court ruled that the RTB (Retirement Travel Benefits) provisions in the 1991 Handbook had become part of the contract of employment through variation. The court found that there was sufficient consideration for the variation, as the employee's decision not to leave the company constituted fresh consideration. The court also held that the RTB provisions applied to a dismissed employee who had been terminated with notice or payment in lieu of notice.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in CACV 7/2010 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Variation of Contract**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In CACV 7/2010, the RTB provisions in the 1991 Handbook were argued to have become part of the contract through variation. In our current case, the variation involves reducing the frequency of cleaning services.
- **Legal Concept 2: Consideration for Variation**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In CACV 7/2010, the court found that the employee's decision not to leave the company provided sufficient consideration for the variation. In our current case, S&A's acceptance of reduced cleaning frequency could be seen as consideration.
- **Legal Concept 3: Intention to Create Legal Relations**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In CACV 7/2010, the court examined whether the parties intended the RTB provisions to have contractual force. In our current case, the intention to create legal relations can be inferred from the written communication between Sparkling Bright and S&A regarding the temporary reduction in cleaning frequency.
- **Legal Concept 4: Contractual Terms and Liability**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In CACV 7/2010, the court considered whether the RTB provisions were discretionary or contractual. In our current case, the liability for property damage is in question, particularly whether the WMA conditions, which limit liability, were incorporated into the contract.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (CACV 7/2010)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a variation in contract terms being agreed upon by both parties, supported by fresh consideration, the court should decide that the variation is legally binding. This rule was justified in CACV 7/2010 because the employee's decision not to leave the company provided fresh consideration, and the parties' consistent observance of the RTB provisions indicated an intention to create legal relations.

Applying this rule to our current case:
- **Variation of Contract**: The agreement to reduce the frequency of cleaning services was communicated and accepted by both parties, indicating a mutual agreement to vary the contract.
- **Consideration for Variation**: S&A's acceptance of reduced cleaning frequency, provided the office remained clean, can be seen as fresh consideration, similar to the employee's decision not to leave in CACV 7/2010.
- **Intention to Create Legal Relations**: The written communication between Sparkling Bright and S&A indicates an intention to create legal relations regarding the temporary reduction in cleaning frequency.
- **Contractual Terms and Liability**: The WMA conditions, which limit liability, were referenced in the verification sheet signed by S&A's office manager. This could be seen as an incorporation of those terms into the contract, limiting Sparkling Bright's liability for the damaged laptop.

Therefore, Sparkling Bright can argue that the variation to reduce cleaning frequency was supported by fresh consideration and is legally binding. Additionally, the WMA conditions limiting liability were incorporated into the contract, potentially allowing Sparkling Bright to resist S&A's demand for compensation for the damaged laptop.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (CACV 7/2010 BETWEEN CHONG CHENG LIN COURTNEY Plaintiff (Respondent) and CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LIMITED Defendant (Appellant)) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Variation of Contract**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In CACV 7/2010, the RTB provisions in the 1991 Handbook were argued to have become part of the contract through variation. In our current case, the variation involves reducing the frequency of cleaning services, which was communicated and accepted by both parties.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Consideration for Variation**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In CACV 7/2010, the court found that the employee's decision not to leave the company provided sufficient consideration for the variation. In our current case, S&A's acceptance of reduced cleaning frequency, provided the office remained clean, can be seen as fresh consideration.
  
- **Legal Concept 3: Intention to Create Legal Relations**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In CACV 7/2010, the court examined whether the parties intended the RTB provisions to have contractual force. In our current case, the intention to create legal relations can be inferred from the written communication between Sparkling Bright and S&A regarding the temporary reduction in cleaning frequency.
  
- **Legal Concept 4: Contractual Terms and Liability**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In CACV 7/2010, the court considered whether the RTB provisions were discretionary or contractual. In our current case, the liability for property damage is in question, particularly whether the WMA conditions, which limit liability, were incorporated into the contract.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in CACV 7/2010, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Clarity and Certainty in Contractual Relations**: Just as in CACV 7/2010, recognizing the variation as legally binding provides clarity and certainty in contractual relations. It ensures that parties can rely on agreed variations without fear of them being later contested.

2. **Fairness and Equity**: The decision in CACV 7/2010 upheld the fairness principle by recognizing the employee's continued service as valid consideration. Similarly, in our case, S&A's acceptance of reduced cleaning frequency, provided the office remained clean, should be seen as valid consideration, ensuring fairness to both parties.

3. **Encouragement of Good Faith Negotiations**: By upholding the variation, the court would encourage parties to negotiate in good faith and honor their agreements, fostering a more cooperative and predictable business environment.

4. **Consistency in Legal Application**: Applying the same legal principles consistently across similar cases ensures that the law is applied uniformly, which is crucial for maintaining public confidence in the legal system.

Therefore, Sparkling Bright can argue that the variation to reduce cleaning frequency was supported by fresh consideration and is legally binding. Additionally, the WMA conditions limiting liability were incorporated into the contract, potentially allowing Sparkling Bright to resist S&A's demand for compensation for the damaged laptop. This approach aligns with the principles established in CACV 7/2010 and promotes fairness, clarity, and consistency in contractual relations.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case CACV 7/2010 BETWEEN CHONG CHENG LIN COURTNEY Plaintiff (Respondent) and CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LIMITED Defendant (Appellant), the court's decision was significantly influenced by the factor of "consistent observance of the RTB provisions by both parties." This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as clarity and certainty in contractual relations, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it demonstrated a mutual understanding and acceptance of the RTB provisions as part of the contract. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of "consistent observance" is notably absent as there is no evidence that Sparkling Bright and S&A had a consistent practice of observing the WMA conditions or the reduced cleaning frequency before the dispute arose.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor of "explicit reference to external standard conditions (WMA conditions)" that was not present in CACV 7/2010. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the explicit reference to WMA conditions in the verification sheet signed by S&A's office manager introduces a potential limitation of liability that was not considered in the precedent case. Due to this explicit reference, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as undermining the principle of fairness and potentially allowing Sparkling Bright to evade liability for damages caused by its employees' negligence, unlike in CACV 7/2010. This is because the explicit reference to WMA conditions could be seen as an attempt to unilaterally impose terms that were not mutually agreed upon at the time of the original contract formation.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from CACV 7/2010 BETWEEN CHONG CHENG LIN COURTNEY Plaintiff (Respondent) and CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LIMITED Defendant (Appellant) should be stated as: "When both the fact pattern of a variation in contract terms being agreed upon by both parties, supported by fresh consideration, and the consistent observance of the varied terms by both parties are present, the court should decide that the variation is legally binding." Omitting the consistent observance of the varied terms from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of parties being able to unilaterally impose terms without mutual agreement or consistent practice, thereby undermining the principle of fairness and predictability in contractual relations. Indeed, the opinion in CACV 7/2010 explicitly states that the consistent observance of the RTB provisions by both parties was crucial to their decision, as it demonstrated a mutual understanding and acceptance of the RTB provisions as part of the contract.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in CACV 7/2010 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of parties being able to unilaterally impose terms without mutual agreement or consistent practice, thereby ensuring fairness and predictability in contractual relations. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because the explicit reference to the WMA conditions in the verification sheet signed by S&A's office manager introduces a potential limitation of liability that was not considered in the precedent case. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The explicit reference to WMA conditions should be given due consideration, and the court should recognize that the variation to reduce cleaning frequency was supported by fresh consideration and is legally binding, while also acknowledging the incorporation of the WMA conditions limiting liability.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of "consistent observance of the varied terms by both parties," which was present in the precedent case CACV 7/2010 BETWEEN CHONG CHENG LIN COURTNEY Plaintiff (Respondent) and CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LIMITED Defendant (Appellant), requiring this factor for all similar cases of contract variation would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would mean that any variation in contract terms would only be enforceable if there was a history of consistent observance, which could unfairly disadvantage parties who have mutually agreed to a variation but have not yet had the opportunity to demonstrate consistent observance. Conversely, not requiring consistent observance would allow for a more flexible and fair approach, recognizing mutual agreements to vary contract terms as legally binding even in the absence of a long history of observance. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which emphasize the importance of mutual consent and consideration in forming binding agreements.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of "consistent observance of the varied terms by both parties," which was present in CACV 7/2010, we have the additional factor of "explicit reference to external standard conditions (WMA conditions)." This explicit reference, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of mutual agreement to vary the contract terms, serves a similar function to consistent observance in the precedent case. Given the presence of the explicit reference to WMA conditions, we submit that the reasoning in CACV 7/2010 still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as clarity, fairness, and predictability in contractual relations would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. The explicit reference to WMA conditions provides a clear indication of the parties' intention to incorporate those terms into the contract, thereby supporting the enforceability of the variation and the limitation of liability.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to CACV 7/2010 BETWEEN CHONG CHENG LIN COURTNEY Plaintiff (Respondent) and CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LIMITED Defendant (Appellant), the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in the areas of contract variation, consideration for variation, and the intention to create legal relations. However, it also differs in significant ways, such as the explicit reference to external standard conditions (WMA conditions) and the absence of consistent observance of the varied terms by both parties.

The proposed legal rule that a variation in contract terms, supported by fresh consideration and mutual agreement, should be legally binding finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the explicit reference to WMA conditions in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the explicit reference to WMA conditions introduces a potential limitation of liability that was not considered in the precedent case, and the counterargument that requiring consistent observance for all contract variations could unfairly disadvantage parties who have mutually agreed to a variation but have not yet had the opportunity to demonstrate consistent observance.

Considering the underlying legal principles of mutual consent, consideration, and the intention to create legal relations, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Sparkling Bright can successfully resist S&A’s two demands. The variation to reduce cleaning frequency was supported by fresh consideration and is legally binding. Additionally, the WMA conditions limiting liability were incorporated into the contract, potentially allowing Sparkling Bright to resist S&A's demand for compensation for the damaged laptop.

This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by recognizing mutual agreements to vary contract terms as legally binding, even in the absence of a long history of observance, and by acknowledging the incorporation of explicit terms that limit liability.

   - The right, duty, or liability may be negatived or varied by express agreement, or by the course of dealing between the parties, or by usage if the usage is such as to bind both parties to the contract

   Exceptions:
   - The Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 71) applies
   - An express condition or warranty is inconsistent with an implied condition or warranty

### Minor Premise:

1. Corporate Bodies Contracts Ordinance Cap. 293 Section 2 Subsection 1-5:
   - The contract between Sparkling Bright and S&A was made on behalf of both corporate bodies.
   - The contract was in writing and signed by representatives of both companies.
   - The contract is therefore effectual in law and binds both parties.

2. Corporate Bodies Contracts Ordinance Cap. 293 Section 2 Subsection 3-5:
   - The contract was varied by mutual agreement through written communication (emails) between Sparkling Bright and S&A.
   - The variation was agreed upon in the same manner as the original contract (written communication).
   - The variation is therefore effectual in law and binds both parties.

3. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 57 Subsection 1-2:
   - The original contract was silent on liability for property damage.
   - The verification sheet signed by S&A’s office manager included a reference to WMA standard conditions, which include a term relieving Sparkling Bright from liability for damages.
   - This term may be considered part of the contract by course of dealing or usage, as it was referenced in the verification sheet and the WMA conditions are freely available online.
   - However, the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 71) may apply, and the term may be subject to scrutiny for fairness and reasonableness.

### Conclusion:

1. The variation of the contract to reduce cleaning frequency was agreed upon by both parties and is binding under the Corporate Bodies Contracts Ordinance Cap. 293 Section 2 Subsection 3-5. Therefore, Sparkling Bright can successfully resist S&A’s demand to resume weekly cleanings immediately.

2. The term in the WMA standard conditions relieving Sparkling Bright from liability for damages may be considered part of the contract by course of dealing or usage. However, this term may be subject to scrutiny under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 71) for fairness and reasonableness. If the term is found to be fair and reasonable, Sparkling Bright can successfully resist S&A’s demand for compensation for the damaged laptop. If not, Sparkling Bright may be liable for the damages.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCCT 26/2014)
In the case of HCCT 26/2014 BETWEEN IPSON RENOVATION LIMITED Plaintiff and THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF CONNIE TOWERS Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled on several key issues regarding the power to suspend works, vary the scope of works, and reduce the contract sum. The court found that the IO did not have the power to unilaterally vary the scope of the works or reduce the contract sum without clear contractual authority. The court also held that the IO's actions constituted a repudiatory breach of the contract, which the contractor accepted, thereby terminating the contract.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCCT 26/2014 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Authority to Vary Contract Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (HCCT 26/2014)**: The IO attempted to vary the scope of works and reduce the contract sum without clear contractual authority.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (Current Case)**: Sparkling Bright and S&A agreed to temporarily reduce the frequency of deep cleanings, but the original contract was silent on such variations.

- **Legal Concept 2: Acceptance of Variations**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (HCCT 26/2014)**: The contractor did not accept the IO's proposed variations and instead treated them as a repudiatory breach.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (Current Case)**: S&A accepted the temporary reduction in cleaning frequency, provided the office remained clean.

- **Legal Concept 3: Repudiatory Breach**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (HCCT 26/2014)**: The IO's actions in varying the contract terms without authority were deemed a repudiatory breach.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (Current Case)**: Sparkling Bright's failure to maintain the agreed level of service and the damage caused by its employee could be seen as a breach of contract.

- **Legal Concept 4: Liability for Damages**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (HCCT 26/2014)**: The court considered whether the IO was liable for damages due to its breach.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (Current Case)**: S&A is seeking compensation for the damaged laptop, and the contract is silent on liability for such damages.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCCT 26/2014)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a party attempting to vary contract terms without clear contractual authority and the other party not accepting such variations, the court should decide that the actions constitute a repudiatory breach. This rule was justified in HCCT 26/2014 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring contractual certainty and protecting the rights of the non-breaching party outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially limiting flexibility in contract performance.

Applying this rule to the current case:

1. **Variation of Contract Terms**: The temporary reduction in cleaning frequency was agreed upon by both parties, so it does not constitute a unilateral variation without authority. Therefore, Sparkling Bright can argue that this variation was mutually agreed upon and binding.

2. **Liability for Damages**: The verification sheet signed by S&A's office manager included a reference to the WMA conditions, which limit liability for damages. Sparkling Bright can argue that S&A had constructive notice of these terms, and thus, Sparkling Bright is not liable for the damaged laptop.

3. **Repudiatory Breach**: Sparkling Bright's failure to maintain the agreed level of service and the damage caused by its employee could be seen as a breach. However, since S&A accepted the temporary reduction in cleaning frequency, Sparkling Bright can argue that it did not repudiate the contract.

In conclusion, Sparkling Bright can successfully resist S&A’s demands by arguing that the variation in cleaning frequency was mutually agreed upon and that the WMA conditions limit its liability for the damaged laptop.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCCT 26/2014) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Authority to Vary Contract Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (HCCT 26/2014)**: The IO attempted to vary the scope of works and reduce the contract sum without clear contractual authority.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (Current Case)**: Sparkling Bright and S&A agreed to temporarily reduce the frequency of deep cleanings, but the original contract was silent on such variations.

- **Legal Concept 2: Acceptance of Variations**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (HCCT 26/2014)**: The contractor did not accept the IO's proposed variations and instead treated them as a repudiatory breach.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (Current Case)**: S&A accepted the temporary reduction in cleaning frequency, provided the office remained clean.

- **Legal Concept 3: Repudiatory Breach**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (HCCT 26/2014)**: The IO's actions in varying the contract terms without authority were deemed a repudiatory breach.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (Current Case)**: Sparkling Bright's failure to maintain the agreed level of service and the damage caused by its employee could be seen as a breach of contract.

- **Legal Concept 4: Liability for Damages**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (HCCT 26/2014)**: The court considered whether the IO was liable for damages due to its breach.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (Current Case)**: S&A is seeking compensation for the damaged laptop, and the contract is silent on liability for such damages.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCCT 26/2014. This decision would be justified because, as in HCCT 26/2014, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Contractual Certainty**: Upholding the mutual agreement to temporarily reduce the cleaning frequency ensures that both parties' intentions and agreements are respected, thereby promoting contractual certainty and reliability.

2. **Protection of Rights**: By recognizing the agreed variation, the court would protect the rights of both parties to negotiate and agree on temporary changes without fear of unilateral repudiation claims.

3. **Limitation of Liability**: Enforcing the WMA conditions, which were referenced in the verification sheet signed by S&A’s office manager, would limit Sparkling Bright's liability for the damaged laptop. This aligns with the principle that parties should be bound by the terms they have agreed to, even if those terms are incorporated by reference.

4. **Encouragement of Good Faith**: By acknowledging the temporary reduction in services as mutually agreed and binding, the court would encourage parties to act in good faith and honor their agreements, even when facing unforeseen circumstances.

In conclusion, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns as HCCT 26/2014, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCCT 26/2014, it would have the positive effects of ensuring contractual certainty, protecting the rights of the parties, limiting liability according to agreed terms, and encouraging good faith in contractual dealings.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCCT 26/2014, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the clear lack of contractual authority for the IO to unilaterally vary the scope of works and reduce the contract sum. This lack of authority was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—upholding contractual certainty and protecting the contractor's rights—outweighed any potential drawbacks, such as limiting flexibility in contract performance. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of lacking clear contractual authority is notably absent. The variation in cleaning frequency was mutually agreed upon by both Sparkling Bright and S&A, indicating that there was a consensual modification of the contract terms, unlike the unilateral actions in HCCT 26/2014.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—the inclusion of the WMA conditions referenced in the verification sheet signed by S&A’s office manager—that was not present in HCCT 26/2014. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces a term that limits Sparkling Bright's liability for damages. Due to the presence of the WMA conditions, applying the same outcome (finding a repudiatory breach) in our case would have more negative consequences, such as undermining the agreed-upon terms and the principle of freedom of contract, than positive ones. Unlike in HCCT 26/2014, where the lack of authority to vary the contract was clear, the WMA conditions in our case provide a contractual basis for limiting liability, which should be respected to uphold the parties' agreement.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCCT 26/2014 should be stated as "When both [i*] (attempting to vary contract terms without clear contractual authority) and [m] (mutual agreement to a temporary variation) are present, the court should decide [o] (that the variation is binding and not a repudiatory breach)." Omitting [m] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q] (undermining the principle of freedom of contract and the parties' ability to mutually agree on temporary variations). Indeed, the opinion in HCCT 26/2014 explicitly states that the lack of clear contractual authority was crucial to their decision, highlighting the importance of mutual agreement in contract variations.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCCT 26/2014 was clearly designed to prevent [undesirable consequence u] (unilateral variations of contract terms without authority, leading to uncertainty and potential exploitation). However, in our current case, there's no risk of [u] occurring because the variation in cleaning frequency was mutually agreed upon by both Sparkling Bright and S&A. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The mutual agreement between Sparkling Bright and S&A ensures that the variation was consensual and does not constitute a repudiatory breach.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of "attempting to vary contract terms without clear contractual authority" (factor m), which was present in the precedent case HCCT 26/2014, requiring this factor for all similar cases of "mutual agreement to a temporary variation" (fact pattern i*) would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would undermine the principle of freedom of contract and the parties' ability to mutually agree on temporary variations. Conversely, not requiring factor m would allow for a desirable outcome, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area. This would promote contractual flexibility and respect the parties' autonomy to negotiate and agree on temporary changes without fear of unilateral repudiation claims.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of "attempting to vary contract terms without clear contractual authority" (factor m), which was present in HCCT 26/2014, we have the additional factor of "inclusion of the WMA conditions referenced in the verification sheet" (factor n). This factor n, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of "mutual agreement to a temporary variation" (fact pattern i*), serves a similar function to factor m in the precedent case. Given the presence of factor n, we submit that the reasoning in HCCT 26/2014 still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as upholding contractual certainty, protecting the rights of the parties, and encouraging good faith in contractual dealings, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCCT 26/2014, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in the context of authority to vary contract terms and the acceptance of variations. However, it also differs in significant ways, such as the mutual agreement to temporarily reduce the cleaning frequency and the inclusion of the WMA conditions referenced in the verification sheet.

The proposed legal rule from HCCT 26/2014, which emphasizes the need for clear contractual authority to vary contract terms, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the mutual agreement between Sparkling Bright and S&A and the WMA conditions limiting liability.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the mutual agreement to reduce cleaning frequency was consensual and binding, and the counterargument that the WMA conditions should limit liability for the damaged laptop. Considering the underlying legal principles of contractual certainty, protection of parties' rights, and the encouragement of good faith in contractual dealings, we conclude that Sparkling Bright can successfully resist S&A’s demands.

1. **Variation of Contract Terms**: The temporary reduction in cleaning frequency was mutually agreed upon by both parties, making it binding and not a unilateral variation without authority. This aligns with the principle of freedom of contract and respects the parties' autonomy to negotiate and agree on temporary changes.

2. **Liability for Damages**: The WMA conditions, referenced in the verification sheet signed by S&A’s office manager, limit Sparkling Bright's liability for the damaged laptop. This term was incorporated by reference and should be respected to uphold the parties' agreement.

In conclusion, Sparkling Bright can successfully resist S&A’s demands by arguing that the variation in cleaning frequency was mutually agreed upon and that the WMA conditions limit its liability for the damaged laptop. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency, ensuring that contractual agreements and limitations of liability are respected.


# Contract Law: Whether Sparkling Bright's failure to resume weekly cleanings immediately upon S&A's request constitutes a breach of contract

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 8 Subsections 1, 2, and 3
Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 13 Subsections 1 and 2

### Major Premise:

1. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 8 Subsections 1, 2, and 3

   Conditions:
   - A right, duty or liability would arise under a contract for the supply of a service by virtue of the Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457.
   - The contract is for the supply of a service.
   - The contract is not with a party who deals as a consumer.

   Consequences:
   - The right, duty or liability may be negatived or varied by express agreement, or by the course of dealing between the parties, or by such usage as binds both parties to the contract.

   Exceptions:
   - The express term is inconsistent with the implied term.
   - The contract is with a party who deals as a consumer, in which case the other party cannot exclude or restrict any liability arising under the contract by virtue of the Ordinance.

2. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 13 Subsection 1

   Conditions:
   - A contract term has to satisfy the requirement of reasonableness.
   - The contract has been terminated either by breach or by a party electing to treat it as repudiated.

   Consequences:
   - The contract term may still be found to satisfy the requirement of reasonableness and be given effect accordingly.

   Exceptions:
   - None.

3. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 13 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - A contract term has to satisfy the requirement of reasonableness.
   - On a breach, the contract is nevertheless affirmed by a party entitled to treat it as repudiated.

   Consequences:
   - The requirement of reasonableness in relation to any contract term is not excluded.

   Exceptions:
   - None.

### Minor Premise:

1. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 8 Subsections 1, 2, and 3:
- A right, duty or liability would arise under the contract for the supply of cleaning services by virtue of the Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457.
- The contract between Sparkling Bright and S&A is for the supply of cleaning services.
- S&A is not a party who deals as a consumer.

   - The liability for property damage (the laptop) may be negatived or varied by express agreement or by the course of dealing between the parties, or by such usage as binds both parties to the contract.
   - The verification sheet signed by S&A’s office manager included a reference to the WMA standard conditions, which relieve service providers from liability for damages or losses caused by their employees.
   - This express term is not inconsistent with any implied term under the Ordinance.
   - Therefore, Sparkling Bright can rely on the WMA standard conditions to negate liability for the damaged laptop.

2. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 13 Subsection 1:
- The term in the WMA standard conditions that excludes liability must satisfy the requirement of reasonableness.
- The contract has not been terminated by breach or by a party electing to treat it as repudiated.

   - The term may still be found to satisfy the requirement of reasonableness and be given effect accordingly.
   - Given that the term is a standard industry practice and was referenced in the verification sheet, it is likely to be considered reasonable.

3. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 13 Subsection 2:
- The term in the WMA standard conditions that excludes liability must satisfy the requirement of reasonableness.
- On the breach (damage to the laptop), the contract was nevertheless affirmed by S&A by continuing to request services.

   - The requirement of reasonableness in relation to the contract term is not excluded.
   - The term is likely to be considered reasonable given the industry standards and the course of dealing between the parties.

### Conclusion:

Sparkling Bright can successfully resist S&A’s demand for compensation for the damaged laptop by relying on the WMA standard conditions, which exclude liability for damages caused by their employees. The term is likely to be considered reasonable under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71.

Regarding the demand to resume weekly cleanings immediately, Sparkling Bright's failure to do so may constitute a breach of contract. However, given the temporary agreement to reduce the frequency of cleanings and the lack of immediate repudiation by S&A, Sparkling Bright may argue that the breach is not material and that they are willing to resume weekly cleanings as requested.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK)

In the case of KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK [2021] HKCFI 2529; HCA 1254/2020 (precedent p), the court dealt with a dispute over the performance and payment under consultancy agreements. The plaintiff (P) claimed that the defendant (D) had breached the agreements by failing to pay the service fees, while the defendant argued that the plaintiff had provided inadequate services, justifying non-payment. The court ruled that summary judgment should only be granted in clear cases where there is no real or bona fide defence or triable issue. The court found that there were factual disputes and triable issues regarding the quality of services provided and the terms of the agreements, thus denying the summary judgment.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Contractual Obligations and Performance**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (p):** Dispute over the adequacy of services provided under a consultancy agreement.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (c):** Dispute over the adequacy of cleaning services provided under a cleaning agreement.

- **Legal Concept 2: Modification of Contract Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (p):** Agreement to reduce service fees due to alleged inadequate performance.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (c):** Agreement to reduce the frequency of cleaning services due to staff shortages.

- **Legal Concept 3: Breach of Contract and Remedies**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (p):** Alleged breach of contract due to non-payment and inadequate services.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (c):** Alleged breach of contract due to property damage and failure to resume weekly cleanings.

- **Legal Concept 4: Incorporation of Terms by Reference**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (p):** Terms of the agreement were broad and vague, leading to disputes over responsibilities.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (c):** Terms of the agreement were silent on liability for property damage, with additional terms referenced in a verification sheet.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK)

This suggests a general rule that when we see disputes over the adequacy of services provided under a contract, modifications to contract terms, and alleged breaches of contract, the court should decide that summary judgment is inappropriate if there are factual disputes and triable issues. This rule was justified in KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring a fair trial and thorough examination of the facts outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially delaying the resolution of the dispute. The court emphasized the importance of not granting summary judgment in cases where the defendant has shown a real or bona fide defence or where there exists a triable issue, thus upholding the principles of justice and fairness in contractual disputes.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Contractual Obligations and Performance**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (p):** Dispute over the adequacy of services provided under a consultancy agreement.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (c):** Dispute over the adequacy of cleaning services provided under a cleaning agreement.

- **Legal Concept 2: Modification of Contract Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (p):** Agreement to reduce service fees due to alleged inadequate performance.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (c):** Agreement to reduce the frequency of cleaning services due to staff shortages.

- **Legal Concept 3: Breach of Contract and Remedies**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (p):** Alleged breach of contract due to non-payment and inadequate services.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (c):** Alleged breach of contract due to property damage and failure to resume weekly cleanings.

- **Legal Concept 4: Incorporation of Terms by Reference**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (p):** Terms of the agreement were broad and vague, leading to disputes over responsibilities.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (c):** Terms of the agreement were silent on liability for property damage, with additional terms referenced in a verification sheet.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK, which is to deny summary judgment and allow the case to proceed to trial. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring a Fair Trial:** Allowing the case to proceed to trial ensures that all factual disputes and triable issues are thoroughly examined. This upholds the principles of justice and fairness, ensuring that both parties have the opportunity to present their evidence and arguments comprehensively.

2. **Clarification of Contractual Obligations:** A trial would provide a detailed examination of the contractual obligations and performance standards expected from both parties. This is particularly important given the broad and vague terms of the agreement and the incorporation of additional terms by reference.

3. **Assessment of Modifications and Breaches:** The trial would allow for a proper assessment of the modifications to the contract terms and whether these modifications were agreed upon and adhered to by both parties. It would also enable a thorough examination of the alleged breaches of contract, including the property damage and the failure to resume weekly cleanings.

4. **Precedent for Future Cases:** A detailed judgment following a trial would provide valuable precedent for similar cases in the future, offering clearer guidance on how such disputes should be resolved and what constitutes adequate performance and breach of contract in similar contexts.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK, it would ensure a fair trial, clarify contractual obligations, properly assess modifications and breaches, and provide valuable precedent for future cases.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of **detailed affirmations and documentary evidence** provided by both parties. This evidence was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—such as a thorough examination of the facts and ensuring a fair trial—outweighed any potential drawbacks, such as delaying the resolution of the dispute. The detailed affirmations and documentary evidence allowed the court to identify factual disputes and triable issues, justifying the denial of summary judgment.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of **detailed affirmations and documentary evidence** is notably absent. The current case lacks comprehensive affirmations and documentary evidence from both Sparkling Bright and S&A regarding the adequacy of cleaning services, the terms of the agreement, and the circumstances surrounding the property damage. This absence of detailed evidence makes it more challenging to identify clear factual disputes and triable issues, which were pivotal in the precedent case to deny summary judgment.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor **(the incorporation of standard WMA conditions by reference)** that was not present in **KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of contractual obligations and performance. The incorporation of the WMA conditions, which include a term that relieves service providers from liability for any damages or losses caused by their employees, directly impacts the liability for the damaged laptop.

Due to the presence of the WMA conditions, applying the same outcome (denying summary judgment) in our case would have more negative consequences, such as undermining the contractual terms agreed upon by the parties and potentially leading to unjust enrichment of S&A, than positive ones. Unlike in **KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK**, where the terms of the agreement were broad and vague, the current case has a specific term incorporated by reference that addresses liability for damages. This term should be given effect, and Sparkling Bright can argue that it is not liable for the damaged laptop based on the WMA conditions, thus altering the balance of positive and negative effects in favor of resisting S&A's demands.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK** should be stated as "When both [disputes over the adequacy of services provided under a contract] and [detailed affirmations and documentary evidence] are present, the court should decide [to deny summary judgment and allow the case to proceed to trial]." Omitting [detailed affirmations and documentary evidence] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of granting summary judgment without a thorough examination of the facts, potentially resulting in an unjust outcome]. Indeed, the opinion in **KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK** explicitly states that [the presence of detailed affirmations and documentary evidence was crucial to their decision to deny summary judgment].

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of granting summary judgment in cases where there are factual disputes and triable issues, thus ensuring a fair trial]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [granting summary judgment without a thorough examination of the facts] because the incorporation of the WMA conditions by reference provides a clear contractual term addressing liability for property damage. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The presence of the WMA conditions alters the balance of positive and negative effects, justifying Sparkling Bright's resistance to S&A's demands based on the specific contractual terms agreed upon by the parties.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks detailed affirmations and documentary evidence, which was present in the precedent case **KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of disputes over the adequacy of services provided under a contract would lead to the undesirable consequence of potentially dismissing valid defences or claims simply due to the absence of extensive documentation. Conversely, not requiring detailed affirmations and documentary evidence would allow for a more equitable consideration of the parties' arguments and evidence, which better aligns with the underlying principles of justice and fairness in contract law. This approach ensures that parties are not unfairly prejudiced by procedural technicalities and that substantive issues are given due consideration.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks detailed affirmations and documentary evidence, which was present in **KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK**, we have the additional factor of the incorporation of the WMA conditions by reference. This incorporation, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of disputes over the adequacy of services and modifications to contract terms, serves a similar function to detailed affirmations and documentary evidence in the precedent case. Given the presence of the WMA conditions, we submit that the reasoning in **KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK** still applies, as the positive effects on ensuring a fair trial and clarifying contractual obligations would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. The WMA conditions provide a clear contractual term addressing liability for property damage, which justifies Sparkling Bright's resistance to S&A's demands based on the specific terms agreed upon by the parties.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as disputes over the adequacy of services provided under a contract, modifications to contract terms, and alleged breaches of contract. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the incorporation of the WMA conditions by reference, which directly impacts liability for property damage.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case, which suggests that summary judgment should be denied if there are factual disputes and triable issues, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially given the absence of detailed affirmations and documentary evidence in the current case and the presence of the WMA conditions.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of ensuring a fair trial and thorough examination of the facts (as argued in the precedent case) against the specific contractual terms agreed upon by the parties in the current case (as highlighted by the incorporation of the WMA conditions).

Considering the underlying legal principles of justice, fairness, and the need to uphold contractual terms, we conclude that Sparkling Bright can successfully resist S&A’s two demands. The WMA conditions, which were incorporated by reference and relieve Sparkling Bright from liability for damages caused by its employees, provide a clear contractual basis for resisting the demand for compensation for the damaged laptop. Additionally, the agreement to temporarily reduce the frequency of cleanings, accepted by S&A, does not constitute a breach of contract, especially given the lack of detailed evidence to the contrary.

Therefore, Sparkling Bright should not be held liable for the damaged laptop, and the temporary reduction in cleaning frequency should be upheld as per the modified agreement. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by respecting the specific terms agreed upon by the parties.


# Contract Law: Whether Sparkling Bright is liable for the damage to the laptop caused by Sam's negligence

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

1. Occupiers Liability Ordinance Cap. 314 Section 4 Subsection 1 and 2
2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 22 Subsection 2
3. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 2 Subsection 1 and 2

### Major Premise:

1. Occupiers Liability Ordinance Cap. 314 Section 4 Subsection 1 and 2

   Conditions:
   - An occupier of premises is bound by contract to permit persons who are strangers to the contract to enter or use the premises.
   - The duty of care owed to them as visitors cannot be restricted or excluded by that contract.

   Consequences:
   - The duty of care shall include the duty to perform obligations under the contract, whether undertaken for their protection or not, in so far as those obligations go beyond the obligations otherwise involved in that duty.

   Exceptions:
   - The contract expressly provides otherwise.
   - The occupier has taken all reasonable care and is not answerable for dangers due to the faulty execution of any work of construction, maintenance or repair or other like operation by persons other than himself, his servants and persons acting under his direction and control.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 22 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - A contract of service or apprenticeship, or an agreement collateral thereto, contains a provision.
   - The provision has the effect of excluding or limiting any liability of the employer in respect of personal injuries caused to the person employed or apprenticed by the negligence of persons in common employment with him.

   Consequences:
   - The provision shall be void.

   Exceptions:
   - None.

3. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 2 Subsection 1 and 2

   Conditions:
   - A contract term or notice purports to exclude or restrict liability for negligence.
   - The liability arises from the breach of an obligation to take reasonable care or exercise reasonable skill in the performance of the contract, or from a common law duty to take reasonable care or exercise reasonable skill, or from the common duty of care imposed by the Occupiers Liability Ordinance.

   Consequences:
   - The exclusion or restriction of liability is subject to the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance.

   Exceptions:
   - None.

### Minor Premise:

1. Occupiers Liability Ordinance Cap. 314 Section 4 Subsection 1 and 2:
   - Sparkling Bright is bound by contract to permit its employees to enter and clean S&A’s premises.
   - The duty of care owed to S&A as visitors cannot be restricted or excluded by the contract.
   - The duty of care includes the duty to perform obligations under the contract, which includes taking reasonable care to avoid damage to property.
   - The contract does not expressly provide otherwise.
   - Sparkling Bright did not take all reasonable care as the damage was caused by Sam's negligence while performing a TikTok challenge.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 22 Subsection 2:
   - This ordinance is not directly applicable as it pertains to personal injuries caused to employees, not property damage to third parties.

3. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 2 Subsection 1 and 2:
   - The verification sheet contains a term that purports to exclude liability for negligence.
   - The liability arises from Sam's negligence in the performance of the cleaning contract.
   - The exclusion or restriction of liability is subject to the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, which means it must be reasonable to be enforceable.

### Conclusion:

1. **Liability for the Laptop Damage:**
   - Sparkling Bright cannot successfully resist S&A’s demand for compensation for the laptop. The exclusion clause in the verification sheet is subject to the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, and given the circumstances (negligence due to a TikTok challenge), it is unlikely to be considered reasonable and enforceable.

2. **Resumption of Weekly Cleanings:**
   - Sparkling Bright must resume weekly cleanings as per the original contract. The temporary agreement to reduce the frequency was conditional on the office remaining "spick and span," which was not met due to the incident. Therefore, S&A's demand to resume weekly cleanings is valid.

Sparkling Bright is liable for the damage to the laptop and must resume weekly cleanings immediately.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCPI000440/2002)
In the case of HCPI000440/2002 (precedent p), the plaintiffs were passengers on a coach tour organized by Guangdong (H.K.) Tours Company Limited. The coach driver, employed by a subcontractor, negligently caused an accident resulting in injuries and deaths. The court ruled that Guangdong (H.K.) Tours Company Limited was liable for the negligence of the coach driver, despite the driver being employed by a subcontractor. The court held that the tour operator had a non-delegable duty of care to provide services with reasonable skill and care, and could not absolve itself of liability through disclaimers or by merely arranging for services to be provided by others.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCPI000440/2002 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Non-Delegable Duty of Care**: 
  - **Fact Pattern in Precedent**: Guangdong (H.K.) Tours Company Limited had a non-delegable duty of care to ensure the safety of the tour services provided, even if some services were subcontracted.
  - **Fact Pattern in Current Case**: Sparkling Bright has a non-delegable duty of care to ensure the safety and proper execution of the cleaning services provided to S&A, even if the specific task was performed by an employee.

- **Liability for Negligence of Subcontractors or Employees**:
  - **Fact Pattern in Precedent**: The tour operator was held liable for the negligence of the coach driver, who was employed by a subcontractor.
  - **Fact Pattern in Current Case**: Sparkling Bright may be held liable for the negligence of its employee, Sam, who damaged the laptop while performing his cleaning duties.

- **Contractual Obligations and Exemption Clauses**:
  - **Fact Pattern in Precedent**: The court found that the tour operator could not rely on general disclaimers to absolve itself of liability for negligence.
  - **Fact Pattern in Current Case**: The small-font disclaimer on the verification sheet referring to WMA conditions may not be sufficient to absolve Sparkling Bright of liability for negligence, especially if S&A was not explicitly made aware of these terms.

- **Implied Terms of Reasonable Skill and Care**:
  - **Fact Pattern in Precedent**: The court implied a term that the tour operator would provide services with reasonable skill and care.
  - **Fact Pattern in Current Case**: It can be implied that Sparkling Bright is required to provide cleaning services with reasonable skill and care, and failing to do so (e.g., through Sam's negligence) breaches this implied term.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCPI000440/2002)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a service provider having a non-delegable duty of care and an employee or subcontractor acting negligently, the court should decide that the service provider is liable for the negligence. This rule was justified in HCPI000440/2002 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that service providers cannot evade responsibility for the safety and proper execution of their services outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially imposing a higher burden on these providers. This promotes accountability and ensures that clients receive the standard of care they are entitled to under the contract. 

Applying this rule to the current case, Sparkling Bright is likely to be held liable for the damage to the laptop caused by Sam's negligence, as they have a non-delegable duty of care to provide cleaning services with reasonable skill and care. The small-font disclaimer referring to WMA conditions is unlikely to be sufficient to absolve them of this liability, especially if S&A was not explicitly made aware of these terms.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCPI000440/2002) are present:

- **Non-Delegable Duty of Care**:
  - **Fact Pattern in Precedent**: Guangdong (H.K.) Tours Company Limited had a non-delegable duty of care to ensure the safety of the tour services provided, even if some services were subcontracted.
  - **Fact Pattern in Current Case**: Sparkling Bright has a non-delegable duty of care to ensure the safety and proper execution of the cleaning services provided to S&A, even if the specific task was performed by an employee.

- **Liability for Negligence of Subcontractors or Employees**:
  - **Fact Pattern in Precedent**: The tour operator was held liable for the negligence of the coach driver, who was employed by a subcontractor.
  - **Fact Pattern in Current Case**: Sparkling Bright may be held liable for the negligence of its employee, Sam, who damaged the laptop while performing his cleaning duties.

- **Contractual Obligations and Exemption Clauses**:
  - **Fact Pattern in Precedent**: The court found that the tour operator could not rely on general disclaimers to absolve itself of liability for negligence.
  - **Fact Pattern in Current Case**: The small-font disclaimer on the verification sheet referring to WMA conditions may not be sufficient to absolve Sparkling Bright of liability for negligence, especially if S&A was not explicitly made aware of these terms.

- **Implied Terms of Reasonable Skill and Care**:
  - **Fact Pattern in Precedent**: The court implied a term that the tour operator would provide services with reasonable skill and care.
  - **Fact Pattern in Current Case**: It can be implied that Sparkling Bright is required to provide cleaning services with reasonable skill and care, and failing to do so (e.g., through Sam's negligence) breaches this implied term.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCPI000440/2002. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Promoting Accountability**: Holding Sparkling Bright liable for the negligence of its employee ensures that service providers cannot evade responsibility for the safety and proper execution of their services. This promotes a higher standard of care and diligence in the performance of contractual obligations.

2. **Consumer Protection**: Ensuring that service providers are liable for the actions of their employees protects clients from suffering losses due to negligence. This aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which aim to provide remedies for breaches and uphold the expectations of the contracting parties.

3. **Encouraging Proper Risk Management**: By holding service providers liable, it encourages them to implement better training, supervision, and risk management practices. This can lead to overall improvements in service quality and safety standards.

4. **Fairness and Justice**: It would be unfair to allow Sparkling Bright to escape liability through a small-font disclaimer that S&A may not have been explicitly aware of. This ensures that disclaimers and exemption clauses are clearly communicated and agreed upon by both parties, promoting transparency and fairness in contractual relationships.

Therefore, Sparkling Bright is likely to be held liable for the damage to the laptop caused by Sam's negligence, and the small-font disclaimer referring to WMA conditions is unlikely to absolve them of this liability. Additionally, Sparkling Bright should resume weekly cleanings as per the original agreement, especially given S&A's specific request and the importance of maintaining the agreed-upon service standards.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the presence of a disclaimer referring to WMA conditions, that was not present in HCPI000440/2002. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of non-delegable duty of care and liability for negligence.

In HCPI000440/2002, there was no specific disclaimer that attempted to limit the liability of the tour operator for the negligence of subcontractors or employees. The court found that the tour operator had a non-delegable duty of care and could not absolve itself of liability through general disclaimers.

However, in our current case, Sparkling Bright included a disclaimer on the verification sheet referring to WMA conditions, which explicitly relieve service providers from liability for any damages or losses caused by their employees. This disclaimer, although printed in small font, was part of the documentation provided to S&A, and the WMA conditions are freely available online.

Due to the presence of this disclaimer, applying the same outcome as in HCPI000440/2002 would have more negative consequences than positive ones. Specifically, it would undermine the principle of freedom of contract, where parties are allowed to agree on terms and conditions, including limitations of liability. Ignoring the disclaimer could set a precedent that diminishes the enforceability of contractual terms, leading to uncertainty and potential unfairness in commercial relationships.

Therefore, the presence of the disclaimer in our current case significantly alters the balance of positive and negative effects, making it inappropriate to apply the same outcome as in HCPI000440/2002. Sparkling Bright may have a stronger argument to resist liability for the damaged laptop based on the disclaimer, provided it can be shown that S&A was or should have been aware of the WMA conditions.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCPI000440/2002 should be stated as "When both a non-delegable duty of care and a specific disclaimer attempting to limit liability are present, the court should decide that the service provider is liable for negligence unless the disclaimer is clearly communicated and agreed upon by both parties." Omitting the requirement for the disclaimer to be clearly communicated and agreed upon could lead to the undesirable consequence of service providers routinely including hidden or obscure disclaimers to evade liability, thereby undermining consumer protection and fairness in contractual relationships.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCPI000440/2002 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of service providers evading responsibility for the safety and proper execution of their services through general disclaimers or by merely arranging for services to be provided by others. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring if the disclaimer referring to WMA conditions was clearly communicated and agreed upon by S&A. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation where a specific disclaimer was included, albeit in small font. The focus should be on whether S&A was or should have been aware of the WMA conditions, rather than automatically holding Sparkling Bright liable.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the explicit absence of a disclaimer, which was present in the precedent case HCPI000440/2002, requiring this factor for all similar cases of non-delegable duty of care and liability for negligence would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would allow service providers to routinely include hidden or obscure disclaimers to evade liability, thereby undermining consumer protection and fairness in contractual relationships. Conversely, not requiring the explicit absence of a disclaimer would allow for a more balanced approach where the focus is on whether the disclaimer was clearly communicated and agreed upon by both parties. This better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, which aim to ensure accountability, transparency, and fairness in contractual obligations.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the explicit absence of a disclaimer, which was present in HCPI000440/2002, we have the additional factor of the small-font disclaimer referring to WMA conditions. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of non-delegable duty of care and liability for negligence, serves a similar function to the absence of a disclaimer in the precedent case. Given the presence of this small-font disclaimer, we submit that the reasoning in HCPI000440/2002 still applies, as the positive effects on consumer protection, accountability, and fairness would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. The focus should be on whether S&A was or should have been aware of the WMA conditions, rather than automatically holding Sparkling Bright liable.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCPI000440/2002, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of a non-delegable duty of care and liability for negligence of employees or subcontractors. However, it also differs in a significant way: the presence of a small-font disclaimer referring to WMA conditions in the current case.

The proposed legal rule from HCPI000440/2002, which holds that a service provider has a non-delegable duty of care and is liable for negligence even if services are subcontracted, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the disclaimer present in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides. On one hand, the precedent emphasizes the importance of holding service providers accountable for the actions of their employees or subcontractors to ensure consumer protection and fairness. On the other hand, the presence of a disclaimer in the current case raises questions about the enforceability of contractual terms and the principle of freedom of contract.

Considering the underlying legal principles of non-delegable duty of care, consumer protection, and the enforceability of contractual terms, we conclude that Sparkling Bright is likely to be held liable for the damage to the laptop caused by Sam's negligence. The small-font disclaimer referring to WMA conditions is unlikely to absolve them of this liability, especially if S&A was not explicitly made aware of these terms. The disclaimer's effectiveness is diminished by its lack of clear communication and agreement between the parties.

Additionally, Sparkling Bright should resume weekly cleanings as per the original agreement, given S&A's specific request and the importance of maintaining the agreed-upon service standards.

Therefore, the final decision is that Sparkling Bright cannot successfully resist S&A’s demands for compensation for the damaged laptop and the resumption of weekly cleanings. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by ensuring accountability and fairness in contractual relationships.


# Contract Law: Whether Sam's conduct in taking a TikTok video while working constitutes gross negligence or wilful misconduct

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 7 Subsection 1-3
Marine Insurance Ordinance Cap. 329 Section 55 Subsection 2(a)

### Major Premise:

1. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 7 Subsection 1-3

   Conditions:
   - A person cannot by reference to any contract term or to a notice given to persons generally or to particular persons exclude or restrict his liability for death or personal injury resulting from negligence.
   - In the case of other loss or damage, a person cannot so exclude or restrict his liability for negligence except in so far as the term or notice satisfies the requirement of reasonableness.
   - Where a contract term or notice purports to exclude or restrict liability for negligence, a person’s agreement to or awareness of it is not of itself to be taken as indicating his voluntary acceptance of any risk.

   Consequences:
   - The exclusion or restriction of liability for negligence is not valid unless it satisfies the requirement of reasonableness.

   Exceptions:
   - None

2. Marine Insurance Ordinance Cap. 329 Section 55 Subsection 2(a)

   Conditions:
   - The insurer is not liable for any loss attributable to the wilful misconduct of the assured.
   - Unless the policy otherwise provides, he is liable for any loss proximately caused by a peril insured against, even though the loss would not have happened but for the misconduct or negligence of the master or crew.

   Consequences:
   - The insurer is not liable for any loss attributable to the wilful misconduct of the assured.

   Exceptions:
   - Unless the policy otherwise provides.

### Minor Premise:

1. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 7 Subsection 1-3:
- Sparkling Bright and S&A entered into a contract for cleaning services.
- The contract was silent on liability for property damage.
- The verification sheet signed by S&A’s office manager included a reference to WMA standard conditions, which exclude liability for damages caused by the service provider’s employees.
- The exclusion clause in the WMA standard conditions must satisfy the requirement of reasonableness to be valid.
- The clause was not explicitly agreed upon in the main contract and was only referenced in a verification sheet signed after the services were rendered.
- Therefore, the exclusion clause may not satisfy the requirement of reasonableness and may not be valid.

2. Marine Insurance Ordinance Cap. 329 Section 55 Subsection 2(a):
- Sam, an employee of Sparkling Bright, caused damage to S&A’s laptop by spilling soap water while taking a TikTok video.
- Sam’s conduct in taking a TikTok video while working could be considered wilful misconduct.
- If Sam’s conduct is deemed wilful misconduct, Sparkling Bright may not be liable for the loss under the principle that an insurer is not liable for any loss attributable to the wilful misconduct of the assured.
- However, this principle applies to insurance contracts and may not directly apply to the contract between Sparkling Bright and S&A.

### Conclusion:

1. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 7 Subsection 1-3 applies, and the exclusion clause in the WMA standard conditions may not be valid as it may not satisfy the requirement of reasonableness. Therefore, Sparkling Bright may not successfully resist S&A’s demand for compensation for the laptop.

2. Marine Insurance Ordinance Cap. 329 Section 55 Subsection 2(a) does not directly apply to the contract between Sparkling Bright and S&A. However, if Sam’s conduct is deemed wilful misconduct, Sparkling Bright may argue that it should not be liable for the loss. This argument may not be strong enough to resist S&A’s demand for compensation.

Therefore, Sparkling Bright is unlikely to successfully resist S&A’s demand for compensation for the laptop. As for the demand to resume weekly cleanings, Sparkling Bright should comply with this request as it was a condition agreed upon by both parties.

### Relevant law:

IQ EQ (NTC) Trustees Asia (Jersey) Limited and Another v. Bruno Arboit and Roderick John Sutton and Another [2019] HKCFA 45; FACV 2/2019 (22 November 2019)

### Major Premise:

1. IQ EQ (NTC) Trustees Asia (Jersey) Limited and Another v. Bruno Arboit and Roderick John Sutton and Another [2019] HKCFA 45; FACV 2/2019 (22 November 2019)

   Conditions:
   - There is an exculpatory clause in the contract that protects the trustees from liability for any acts or omissions falling short of fraud, wilful misconduct, or gross negligence.
   - The trustees' conduct does not amount to gross negligence or wilful misconduct.

   Consequences:
   - The trustees are protected from liability for the acts or omissions.

   Exceptions:
   - The conduct amounts to gross negligence or wilful misconduct.

### Minor Premise:

1. There is an exculpatory clause in the WMA standard conditions that relieves service providers from liability for any damages or losses the client might suffer as a result of any act or omission, however caused, by the service provider’s employees, servants, or agents.
2. Sam, a sanitary engineer employed by Sparkling Bright, accidentally spilt soap water on a laptop while taking a TikTok video for the “Mop on Head” challenge.
3. Taking a TikTok video while balancing a large pail of water on the narrow steps of a ladder constitutes a significant deviation from the standard of care expected of a reasonable person in the same situation.
4. This conduct likely amounts to gross negligence or wilful misconduct because it involves a reckless disregard for the safety of the property being cleaned.

### Conclusion:

The exculpatory clause in the WMA standard conditions does not protect Sparkling Bright from liability because Sam's conduct amounts to gross negligence or wilful misconduct. Therefore, Sparkling Bright cannot successfully resist S&A’s demand for compensation for the laptop.

Regarding the demand to resume weekly cleanings immediately, the agreement between Sparkling Bright and S&A was modified by mutual consent to reduce the frequency of cleanings to fortnightly. However, S&A's request to resume weekly cleanings due to the upcoming important guests can be seen as a reasonable request under the circumstances. Sparkling Bright should comply with this request to maintain good business relations and avoid potential breach of contract claims.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA 1185/2008 and HCA 1429/2012)
In the case of HCA 1185/2008 and HCA 1429/2012 (precedent p), the court ruled that the Plaintiff, Igal Dafni, was not in breach of any fiduciary duties and that the Defendant, CMA CGM SA, was aware of the Plaintiff’s actions and connections with Starship Agencies. The court found that the Defendant’s complaints were contrived and that there was no evidence of wilful misconduct or conflict of interest on the Plaintiff’s part. The court also held that the Defendant was estopped from relying on these matters to justify the termination of the Plaintiff’s employment. The Plaintiff was awarded compensation as per the terms of the Head of Agreement (HOA).

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA 1185/2008 and HCA 1429/2012 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Awareness and Acceptance of Conduct**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (p)**: The Defendant was aware of the Plaintiff’s connections and actions but did not raise any complaints until after the termination.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (c)**: S&A was aware of the standard WMA conditions but did not raise any objections until after the damage occurred.

- **Legal Concept 2: Wilful Misconduct**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (p)**: The court found no evidence of wilful misconduct by the Plaintiff, as there was no intentional or reckless wrongdoing.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (c)**: Sam’s conduct in taking a TikTok video while working could be argued as gross negligence rather than wilful misconduct, as it was not an intentional act to cause damage.

- **Legal Concept 3: Estoppel**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (p)**: The Defendant was estopped from relying on the Plaintiff’s actions to justify termination because they were aware of these actions beforehand.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (c)**: S&A could be estopped from demanding compensation if they were aware of the WMA conditions and did not object to them initially.

- **Legal Concept 4: Contractual Terms and Liability**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (p)**: The court upheld the terms of the HOA, including the compensation clause, as there was no breach of fiduciary duty or wilful misconduct.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (c)**: The WMA conditions, which limit liability for damages, were part of the contractual terms agreed upon by S&A when they signed the verification sheet.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA 1185/2008 and HCA 1429/2012)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of awareness and acceptance of conduct, absence of wilful misconduct, estoppel, and adherence to contractual terms, the court should decide in favor of the party accused of wrongdoing. This rule was justified in HCA 1185/2008 and HCA 1429/2012 because the positive effects of upholding contractual terms and preventing contrived complaints outweigh the negative effects of potential negligence claims. The court emphasized the importance of clear evidence of wilful misconduct and the necessity of raising objections in a timely manner. 

Therefore, Sparkling Bright can argue that:
1. S&A was aware of the WMA conditions and did not object, thus estopping them from demanding compensation.
2. Sam’s conduct, while negligent, does not rise to the level of wilful misconduct as defined in the precedent.
3. The contractual terms, including the WMA conditions, should be upheld, limiting Sparkling Bright’s liability for the damaged laptop.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA 1185/2008 and HCA 1429/2012) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Awareness and Acceptance of Conduct**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (p)**: The Defendant was aware of the Plaintiff’s connections and actions but did not raise any complaints until after the termination.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (c)**: S&A was aware of the standard WMA conditions but did not raise any objections until after the damage occurred.

- **Legal Concept 2: Wilful Misconduct**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (p)**: The court found no evidence of wilful misconduct by the Plaintiff, as there was no intentional or reckless wrongdoing.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (c)**: Sam’s conduct in taking a TikTok video while working could be argued as gross negligence rather than wilful misconduct, as it was not an intentional act to cause damage.

- **Legal Concept 3: Estoppel**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (p)**: The Defendant was estopped from relying on the Plaintiff’s actions to justify termination because they were aware of these actions beforehand.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (c)**: S&A could be estopped from demanding compensation if they were aware of the WMA conditions and did not object to them initially.

- **Legal Concept 4: Contractual Terms and Liability**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (p)**: The court upheld the terms of the HOA, including the compensation clause, as there was no breach of fiduciary duty or wilful misconduct.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (c)**: The WMA conditions, which limit liability for damages, were part of the contractual terms agreed upon by S&A when they signed the verification sheet.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCA 1185/2008 and HCA 1429/2012. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Contractual Terms**: Enforcing the WMA conditions would reinforce the importance of adhering to agreed contractual terms, providing certainty and predictability in commercial relationships.
2. **Preventing Contrived Complaints**: By estopping S&A from raising objections after the fact, the court would discourage parties from making contrived complaints to avoid their contractual obligations.
3. **Clarifying Wilful Misconduct**: Distinguishing between gross negligence and wilful misconduct ensures that only truly egregious conduct is penalized, maintaining a fair balance between the rights and responsibilities of both parties.
4. **Encouraging Timely Objections**: Requiring parties to raise objections in a timely manner promotes transparency and good faith in contractual dealings.

Therefore, Sparkling Bright can successfully resist S&A’s demands for compensation for the laptop and the immediate resumption of weekly cleanings by arguing that:

1. S&A was aware of the WMA conditions and did not object, thus estopping them from demanding compensation.
2. Sam’s conduct, while negligent, does not rise to the level of wilful misconduct as defined in the precedent.
3. The contractual terms, including the WMA conditions, should be upheld, limiting Sparkling Bright’s liability for the damaged laptop.

In conclusion, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA 1185/2008 and HCA 1429/2012, it would have the positive effects of upholding contractual terms, preventing contrived complaints, clarifying the standard for wilful misconduct, and encouraging timely objections.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA 1185/2008 and HCA 1429/2012, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the factor of **estoppel**. Estoppel was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as upholding contractual terms and preventing contrived complaints, outweighed any potential drawbacks because the Defendant was aware of the Plaintiff’s actions and connections but did not raise any complaints until after the termination. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of **estoppel** is notably absent as there is no clear evidence that S&A was aware of the specific conduct (i.e., the TikTok video) that led to the damage before it occurred. Therefore, S&A might not be estopped from demanding compensation for the damaged laptop.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor of **gross negligence** that was not present in HCA 1185/2008 and HCA 1429/2012. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because Sam’s conduct in taking a TikTok video while working could be argued as gross negligence, which is a higher degree of negligence than what was considered in the precedent case. Due to this factor of gross negligence, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the standard of care expected in professional services and potentially encouraging reckless behavior among employees, unlike in HCA 1185/2008 and HCA 1429/2012 because the precedent case did not involve such a high degree of negligence.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA 1185/2008 and HCA 1429/2012 should be stated as: "When both the fact pattern of awareness and acceptance of conduct, absence of wilful misconduct, estoppel, and adherence to contractual terms (i*) and the factor of gross negligence (m) are present, the court should decide in favor of the party accused of wrongdoing (o)." Omitting the factor of gross negligence (m) from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence (q) of undermining the standard of care expected in professional services and potentially encouraging reckless behavior among employees. Indeed, the opinion in HCA 1185/2008 and HCA 1429/2012 explicitly states that the absence of wilful misconduct was crucial to their decision, emphasizing that only truly egregious conduct should be penalized.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA 1185/2008 and HCA 1429/2012 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence (u) of parties making contrived complaints to avoid their contractual obligations. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence (u) occurring because the issue at hand involves gross negligence, which is a higher degree of negligence than what was considered in the precedent case. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—preventing contrived complaints—is not relevant to our situation where the focus is on the standard of care and gross negligence.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of **estoppel**, which was present in the precedent case HCA 1185/2008 and HCA 1429/2012, requiring this factor for all similar cases of **awareness and acceptance of conduct, absence of wilful misconduct, and adherence to contractual terms** would lead to the undesirable consequence of undermining the enforceability of contractual terms and allowing parties to avoid their obligations by raising objections only after an issue arises. Conversely, not requiring **estoppel** would allow for the desirable outcome of upholding the agreed-upon contractual terms and ensuring that parties cannot retroactively contest terms they were aware of and accepted, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, such as certainty, predictability, and good faith in commercial dealings.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of **estoppel**, which was present in HCA 1185/2008 and HCA 1429/2012, we have the additional factor of **gross negligence**. This **gross negligence**, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of **awareness and acceptance of conduct, absence of wilful misconduct, and adherence to contractual terms**, serves a similar function to **estoppel** in the precedent case. Given the presence of **gross negligence**, we submit that the reasoning in HCA 1185/2008 and HCA 1429/2012 still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as upholding the standard of care in professional services and discouraging reckless behavior among employees would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA 1185/2008 and HCA 1429/2012, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the awareness and acceptance of conduct, absence of wilful misconduct, and adherence to contractual terms. However, it also differs significantly in the presence of gross negligence, which was not a factor in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule of upholding contractual terms and preventing contrived complaints finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of maintaining the standard of care in professional services and the necessity of timely objections to contractual terms.

Considering the underlying legal principles of contract law, such as certainty, predictability, and good faith in commercial dealings, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Sparkling Bright can successfully resist S&A’s demands for compensation for the laptop and the immediate resumption of weekly cleanings. This decision is based on the following key factors:

1. **Awareness and Acceptance of Conduct**: S&A was aware of the WMA conditions and did not object, thus estopping them from demanding compensation.
2. **Absence of Wilful Misconduct**: Sam’s conduct, while negligent, does not rise to the level of wilful misconduct as defined in the precedent.
3. **Adherence to Contractual Terms**: The WMA conditions, which limit liability for damages, were part of the contractual terms agreed upon by S&A when they signed the verification sheet.

While the factor of gross negligence is present, it does not outweigh the importance of upholding the agreed-upon contractual terms and ensuring that parties cannot retroactively contest terms they were aware of and accepted. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency.


# Contract Law: Whether S&A's acceptance of reduced cleaning frequency affects its right to demand immediate resumption of weekly cleanings

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK)
In the case of KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK [2021] HKCFI 2529; HCA 1254/2020 (precedent p), the court ruled on a summary judgment application concerning the alleged breach of a consultancy service agreement. The plaintiff sought summary judgment for outstanding service fees and loss of future income. The court considered whether there were triable issues that warranted a full trial. The court ultimately found that there were factual disputes and triable issues, particularly regarding the duties under the service agreements, the quality of performance, and the alleged breaches, which necessitated a full trial rather than summary judgment.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Contractual Duties and Performance**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (p)**: The dispute involved the specific duties and performance under the consultancy service agreements.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (c)**: The dispute involves the specific duties and performance under the cleaning service agreement between Sparkling Bright and S&A.

- **Legal Concept 2: Modification of Contract Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (p)**: There was an amendment to the service fee in the consultancy agreement, which was a point of contention.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (c)**: There was a temporary modification to the cleaning frequency agreed upon by S&A and Sparkling Bright.

- **Legal Concept 3: Breach of Contract and Remedies**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (p)**: The plaintiff claimed a breach of contract and sought remedies for outstanding fees and future losses.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (c)**: S&A claims a breach of contract due to property damage and demands compensation and resumption of weekly cleanings.

- **Legal Concept 4: Triable Issues and Summary Judgment**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (p)**: The court found that there were triable issues that required a full trial.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (c)**: The current case involves potential triable issues regarding the interpretation of the contract and the liability for damages.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK)
This suggests a general rule that when we see fact pattern i* (disputes over contractual duties, performance, modifications, and alleged breaches), the court should decide that there are triable issues requiring a full trial rather than summary judgment. This rule was justified in KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring a thorough examination of the facts and contractual terms outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially delaying resolution. This approach upholds the underlying values of fairness and thoroughness in contract law, ensuring that all relevant facts and interpretations are fully considered before reaching a final decision.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Contractual Duties and Performance**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (p)**: The dispute involved the specific duties and performance under the consultancy service agreements.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (c)**: The dispute involves the specific duties and performance under the cleaning service agreement between Sparkling Bright and S&A.

- **Legal Concept 2: Modification of Contract Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (p)**: There was an amendment to the service fee in the consultancy agreement, which was a point of contention.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (c)**: There was a temporary modification to the cleaning frequency agreed upon by S&A and Sparkling Bright.

- **Legal Concept 3: Breach of Contract and Remedies**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (p)**: The plaintiff claimed a breach of contract and sought remedies for outstanding fees and future losses.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (c)**: S&A claims a breach of contract due to property damage and demands compensation and resumption of weekly cleanings.

- **Legal Concept 4: Triable Issues and Summary Judgment**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (p)**: The court found that there were triable issues that required a full trial.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (c)**: The current case involves potential triable issues regarding the interpretation of the contract and the liability for damages.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome, which is to recognize that there are triable issues requiring a full trial rather than summary judgment. This decision would be justified because, as in KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Thorough Examination of Facts and Contractual Terms**: Just as in the precedent case, a full trial would allow for a comprehensive examination of the specific duties and performance under the cleaning service agreement, the nature of the temporary modification, and the circumstances surrounding the alleged breach. This thorough examination is crucial for ensuring that justice is served based on a complete understanding of the facts.

2. **Fairness in Adjudication**: By allowing a full trial, the court ensures that both parties have the opportunity to present their evidence and arguments in detail. This upholds the principle of fairness in adjudication, as it prevents a premature judgment based on incomplete information.

3. **Clarification of Contractual Obligations**: A full trial would provide clarity on the contractual obligations of both parties, particularly regarding the liability for property damage and the terms of the temporary modification. This would help in setting a clear precedent for similar cases in the future, promoting consistency and predictability in contract law.

4. **Balancing Interests of Both Parties**: Recognizing the triable issues and proceeding to a full trial balances the interests of both Sparkling Bright and S&A. It ensures that Sparkling Bright has the opportunity to defend against the claims of property damage and the demand for immediate resumption of weekly cleanings, while also allowing S&A to seek redress for the alleged breach.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK, it would have the positive effects of ensuring a thorough examination of the facts, upholding fairness in adjudication, clarifying contractual obligations, and balancing the interests of both parties.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of detailed affirmations and evidence provided by both parties, which highlighted the specific duties and performance under the consultancy service agreements. This detailed evidence was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—such as a thorough examination of the facts and contractual terms—outweighed any potential drawbacks, like delaying resolution. However, in our current case, this crucial detailed evidence and affirmations are notably absent. The current case lacks the same level of detailed documentation and affirmations regarding the specific duties and performance under the cleaning service agreement between Sparkling Bright and S&A. This absence of detailed evidence makes it more challenging to establish clear triable issues that would necessitate a full trial.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—the presence of a standard condition clause from the Waste Management Association (WMA) that relieves service providers from liability for damages caused by their employees—that was not present in **KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of contractual duties and performance. Because of this WMA clause, applying the same outcome (recognizing triable issues requiring a full trial) in our case would have more negative consequences, such as undermining the enforceability of industry-standard liability clauses and creating uncertainty for service providers, than positive ones. Unlike in **KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK**, where the focus was on the detailed examination of duties and performance, the presence of the WMA clause in our case provides a clear contractual term that limits liability, which should be respected to maintain contractual certainty and industry standards.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK** should be stated as: "When both [i*] (disputes over contractual duties, performance, modifications, and alleged breaches) and [m] (detailed evidence and affirmations regarding the specific duties and performance under the agreement) are present, the court should decide [o] (that there are triable issues requiring a full trial rather than summary judgment)." Omitting [m] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q] (premature judgments based on incomplete information, which could result in unfair outcomes and undermine the thoroughness and fairness of the judicial process). Indeed, the opinion in **KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK** explicitly states that the detailed affirmations and evidence provided by both parties were crucial to their decision to recognize triable issues and proceed to a full trial.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK** was clearly designed to prevent [undesirable consequence u] (unfair outcomes due to a lack of thorough examination of the facts and contractual terms). However, in our current case, there's no risk of [u] occurring because the presence of the WMA clause provides a clear contractual term that limits liability, which should be respected to maintain contractual certainty and industry standards. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The WMA clause offers a clear and specific term that addresses liability, thus negating the need for a full trial to determine the duties and performance under the agreement.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the detailed evidence and affirmations regarding the specific duties and performance under the agreement (factor m), which was present in the precedent case **KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of disputes over contractual duties, performance, modifications, and alleged breaches (fact pattern i*) would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would result in premature judgments based on incomplete information, which could result in unfair outcomes and undermine the thoroughness and fairness of the judicial process. Conversely, not requiring detailed evidence and affirmations would allow for a more flexible approach that considers the presence of clear contractual terms, such as the WMA clause in our case, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, including the enforcement of agreed-upon terms and the maintenance of contractual certainty.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the detailed evidence and affirmations regarding the specific duties and performance under the agreement (factor m), which was present in **KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK**, we have the additional factor of the WMA clause that relieves service providers from liability for damages caused by their employees (factor n). This WMA clause, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of disputes over contractual duties, performance, modifications, and alleged breaches (fact pattern i*), serves a similar function to the detailed evidence and affirmations in the precedent case. Given the presence of the WMA clause, we submit that the reasoning in **KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK** still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as upholding contractual certainty and industry standards, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations:

1. **Key Similarities**:
   - Both cases involve disputes over contractual duties, performance, modifications, and alleged breaches.
   - Both cases require an examination of the specific duties and performance under the agreements.
   - Both cases involve claims of breach of contract and the seeking of remedies.

2. **Key Differences**:
   - The precedent case had detailed evidence and affirmations regarding the specific duties and performance under the consultancy service agreements, which is absent in the current case.
   - The current case involves a standard condition clause from the Waste Management Association (WMA) that relieves service providers from liability for damages caused by their employees, which was not present in the precedent case.

3. **Proposed Legal Rule**:
   - The rule from **KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK** suggests that when there are disputes over contractual duties, performance, modifications, and alleged breaches, and detailed evidence and affirmations are present, the court should recognize triable issues requiring a full trial rather than summary judgment.

4. **Arguments from Both Sides**:
   - **For Applying the Precedent**: The precedent supports a thorough examination of the facts and contractual terms to ensure fairness and justice. This approach would allow both parties to present their evidence and arguments in detail.
   - **Against Applying the Precedent**: The presence of the WMA clause in the current case provides a clear contractual term that limits liability, which should be respected to maintain contractual certainty and industry standards. This clause negates the need for a full trial to determine the duties and performance under the agreement.

5. **Relevant Legal Principles**:
   - **Fairness in Adjudication**: Ensuring that both parties have the opportunity to present their evidence and arguments.
   - **Contractual Certainty**: Upholding agreed-upon terms and maintaining industry standards.
   - **Thorough Examination of Facts**: Ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the facts and contractual terms before reaching a decision.

### Final Decision

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness in adjudication, contractual certainty, and the thorough examination of facts, we conclude that Sparkling Bright can successfully resist S&A’s two demands based on the presence of the WMA clause. This clause provides a clear contractual term that limits liability for damages caused by Sparkling Bright’s employees, which should be respected to maintain contractual certainty and industry standards.

**Key Factors Influencing the Outcome**:
- The WMA clause explicitly relieves Sparkling Bright from liability for damages caused by its employees, which is a significant contractual term that should be upheld.
- The absence of detailed evidence and affirmations regarding the specific duties and performance under the cleaning service agreement makes it challenging to establish clear triable issues that would necessitate a full trial.
- Upholding the WMA clause aligns with the principles of contractual certainty and industry standards, ensuring that agreed-upon terms are respected and enforced.

Therefore, Sparkling Bright should not be held liable for the damages to the laptop, and the temporary modification to the cleaning frequency agreed upon by S&A should be respected, meaning that S&A cannot demand an immediate resumption of weekly cleanings without further negotiation or agreement.

### Major Premise:

1. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 8 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - A person deals as a consumer or on the other’s written standard terms of business
   - The other party is in breach of contract
   - The other party attempts to exclude or restrict liability for the breach by reference to any contract term

### Minor Premise:

1. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 8 Subsection 2:
   - S&A deals with Sparkling Bright on Sparkling Bright’s written standard terms of business (WMA conditions).
   - Sparkling Bright is in breach of contract by damaging S&A’s laptop.
   - Sparkling Bright attempts to exclude liability for the breach by reference to the WMA conditions.
   - The WMA conditions do not satisfy the requirement of reasonableness as they attempt to exclude all liability for any damages or losses caused by the service provider’s employees, servants, or agents, which is overly broad and not reasonable.

2. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 7 Subsections 1 and 2:
   - Sparkling Bright cannot exclude or restrict liability for negligence resulting in death or personal injury.
   - The liability here is for property damage (the laptop), not death or personal injury.
   - Sparkling Bright can exclude or restrict liability for negligence for property damage only if the term satisfies the requirement of reasonableness.
   - The WMA conditions do not satisfy the requirement of reasonableness as they attempt to exclude all liability for any damages or losses caused by the service provider’s employees, servants, or agents, which is overly broad and not reasonable.

3. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 8 Subsections 1 and 2:
   - A contract for the supply of a service (cleaning) is made between Sparkling Bright and S&A.
   - S&A deals as a consumer.
   - Sparkling Bright cannot exclude or restrict any liability arising under the contract by virtue of the Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance.
   - The WMA conditions attempt to exclude liability, but this is subject to the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, which requires reasonableness.

### Conclusion:

Sparkling Bright cannot successfully resist S&A’s demand for compensation for the laptop because the exclusion clause in the WMA conditions does not satisfy the requirement of reasonableness under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 8 Subsection 2 and Section 7 Subsections 1 and 2. Therefore, Sparkling Bright is liable for the damage to the laptop.

Regarding the demand to resume weekly cleanings, Sparkling Bright must comply with the original terms of the contract, as the temporary agreement to reduce the frequency of cleanings was conditional on the office remaining "spick and span," which S&A now disputes. Therefore, Sparkling Bright must resume weekly cleanings as per the original contract.

## Deductive Reasoning: cfa

### Relevant law:

Bewise Motors Co. Ltd. v Hoi Kong Container Services Ltd.

### Major Premise:

1. Bewise Motors Co. Ltd. v Hoi Kong Container Services Ltd.

   Conditions:
   - A bailee is found to have been negligent in any way
   - The bailee negligently allows the article to be stolen
   - The theft is committed by a stranger or by a servant or agent whether entrusted with the article or otherwise

   Consequences:
   - The bailee is liable for the loss or damage

   Exceptions:
   - There are modifying terms that exempt the bailee from liability

### Minor Premise:

1. Bewise Motors Co. Ltd. v Hoi Kong Container Services Ltd.:
- Sparkling Bright is a bailee of S&A's property during the cleaning service.
- Sam, an employee of Sparkling Bright, negligently spilt soap water on a laptop while performing his duties.
- The negligence occurred because Sam was balancing a large pail of water on a narrow ladder while taking a TikTok video, which is clearly negligent behavior.
- Therefore, Sparkling Bright, as the bailee, is liable for the loss or damage to the laptop.

   Exceptions:
   - The agreement between Sparkling Bright and S&A was silent as to liability for property damaged in the course of cleaning.
   - However, the verification sheet signed by S&A’s office manager included a statement that services were provided under standard WMA conditions, which include a term that relieves service providers from liability for any damages or losses caused by the service provider’s employees, servants, or agents.
   - This term could be considered a modifying term that exempts Sparkling Bright from liability.

### Conclusion:

Sparkling Bright can successfully resist S&A’s demand for compensation for the laptop based on the modifying term in the WMA conditions, which exempts them from liability for damages caused by their employees' negligence.

### Additional Issue:

Regarding S&A's demand to resume weekly cleanings immediately:

- The original agreement provided for weekly cleaning, but S&A agreed to a temporary reduction to fortnightly cleanings for the rest of 2020.
- S&A's demand to resume weekly cleanings immediately is a modification of the temporary agreement.
- Given the temporary nature of the reduction and the specific condition that the office remains "spick and span," S&A has the right to request a return to the original terms if the condition is not met or if circumstances change.

### Conclusion:

Sparkling Bright should comply with S&A’s demand to resume weekly cleanings immediately, as it aligns with the original terms of the agreement and the temporary modification was conditional.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (Bewise Motors Company Limited v Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd)
In the case of Bewise Motors Company Limited v Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd (precedent p), the plaintiff, an exporter of motor vehicles, delivered four cars to the defendant's container yard for shipping. The cars were stolen from the yard, and the plaintiff sought damages. The court ruled that the defendant was liable for the theft because the plaintiff was not bound by the defendant's standard terms and conditions, which included limitation and Himalaya clauses, as these terms were not adequately brought to the plaintiff's attention. The court also found that the defendant's employees were involved in the theft, which further negated the limitation clauses.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in Bewise Motors Company Limited v Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Incorporation of Standard Terms and Conditions**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In Bewise Motors, the standard terms and conditions were not adequately brought to the plaintiff's attention. Similarly, in our current case, the standard WMA conditions were only mentioned in small print on a verification sheet, which may not have been adequately brought to S&A's attention.
- **Legal Concept 2: Liability for Negligence**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In Bewise Motors, the defendant was found negligent as a bailee of the cars. In our current case, Sparkling Bright's employee, Sam, was negligent in handling the cleaning equipment, leading to the damage of S&A's laptop.
- **Legal Concept 3: Employee Involvement in the Incident**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In Bewise Motors, the defendant's employees were found to be the source of information leading to the theft. In our current case, the damage was directly caused by Sparkling Bright's employee, Sam, while performing his duties.
- **Legal Concept 4: Reasonableness of Limitation Clauses**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In Bewise Motors, the court considered whether the limitation clauses were reasonable and fair under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance. In our current case, the reasonableness of the WMA conditions, which limit liability for damages caused by the service provider's employees, is in question.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (Bewise Motors Company Limited v Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of standard terms and conditions not being adequately brought to the attention of the contracting party, the court should decide that those terms are not incorporated into the contract, and the service provider cannot rely on them to limit liability. This rule was justified in Bewise Motors Company Limited v Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that parties are fully aware of and consent to contractual terms outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially increased liability for service providers. This promotes transparency and fairness in contractual relationships, ensuring that parties are not unfairly bound by terms they were not adequately informed about.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (Bewise Motors Company Limited v Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Incorporation of Standard Terms and Conditions**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In Bewise Motors, the standard terms and conditions were not adequately brought to the plaintiff's attention. Similarly, in our current case, the standard WMA conditions were only mentioned in small print on a verification sheet, which may not have been adequately brought to S&A's attention.

- **Legal Concept 2: Liability for Negligence**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In Bewise Motors, the defendant was found negligent as a bailee of the cars. In our current case, Sparkling Bright's employee, Sam, was negligent in handling the cleaning equipment, leading to the damage of S&A's laptop.

- **Legal Concept 3: Employee Involvement in the Incident**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In Bewise Motors, the defendant's employees were found to be the source of information leading to the theft. In our current case, the damage was directly caused by Sparkling Bright's employee, Sam, while performing his duties.

- **Legal Concept 4: Reasonableness of Limitation Clauses**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In Bewise Motors, the court considered whether the limitation clauses were reasonable and fair under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance. In our current case, the reasonableness of the WMA conditions, which limit liability for damages caused by the service provider's employees, is in question.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in Bewise Motors Company Limited v Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd. This decision would be justified because, as in Bewise Motors, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Transparency and Fairness**: By not incorporating the WMA conditions due to inadequate notice, the court would promote transparency and fairness in contractual relationships. This ensures that parties are not unfairly bound by terms they were not adequately informed about.

2. **Encouraging Proper Notice of Terms**: This outcome would encourage service providers to ensure that their standard terms and conditions are clearly communicated and brought to the attention of their clients, fostering better business practices.

3. **Protecting Clients from Unfair Terms**: By holding that the limitation clauses are not incorporated, the court would protect clients from potentially unfair terms that they did not explicitly agree to, thereby upholding the principles of contract law.

4. **Maintaining Accountability for Negligence**: The decision would ensure that service providers remain accountable for the negligent actions of their employees, promoting a higher standard of care in the performance of their duties.

Therefore, Sparkling Bright should not be able to rely on the WMA conditions to limit its liability for the damage to S&A's laptop. Additionally, Sparkling Bright should resume weekly cleanings as per the original agreement, as the temporary reduction was conditional and S&A has now requested the resumption of the original service level.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case Bewise Motors Company Limited v Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the defendant's employees were found to be involved in the theft of the cars. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—holding the defendant liable for the theft—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it established a direct link between the defendant's negligence and the loss suffered by the plaintiff. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of employee involvement in the incident is notably absent as there is no evidence to suggest that Sparkling Bright's employees were involved in any intentional wrongdoing or theft. The damage to the laptop was caused by an accident due to negligence, not a deliberate act.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—the explicit mention of standard terms and conditions on the verification sheet—that was not present in Bewise Motors Company Limited v Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of inadequate notice of terms. Because the verification sheet in our current case explicitly mentioned that services were provided under standard WMA conditions and that copies were available on request, it can be argued that S&A had a reasonable opportunity to inquire about these terms. Due to this explicit mention, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as undermining the enforceability of standard terms and conditions that are reasonably brought to the attention of the contracting party, than positive ones. Unlike in Bewise Motors, where the terms were not adequately communicated, the explicit mention in our case provides a stronger basis for arguing that the terms were incorporated into the contract.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from Bewise Motors Company Limited v Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd should be stated as: "When both the fact pattern of standard terms and conditions not being adequately brought to the attention of the contracting party and the involvement of the defendant's employees in the incident are present, the court should decide that those terms are not incorporated into the contract, and the service provider cannot rely on them to limit liability." Omitting the involvement of the defendant's employees from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of service providers being able to escape liability for negligence simply by including standard terms in small print, even when those terms are not adequately communicated to the client. Indeed, the opinion in Bewise Motors Company Limited v Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd explicitly states that the involvement of the defendant's employees was crucial to their decision, as it negated the limitation clauses.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in Bewise Motors Company Limited v Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of service providers escaping liability for negligence through inadequately communicated standard terms and conditions, especially when their employees are involved in the incident. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence occurring because the standard WMA conditions were explicitly mentioned on the verification sheet, providing S&A with a reasonable opportunity to inquire about these terms. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—preventing service providers from escaping liability through hidden terms—is not relevant to our situation where the terms were reasonably communicated.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the involvement of the defendant's employees in intentional wrongdoing (factor m), which was present in the precedent case Bewise Motors Company Limited v Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd, requiring this factor for all similar cases of inadequate notice of standard terms and conditions would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would allow service providers to escape liability for negligence simply by including standard terms in small print, even when those terms are not adequately communicated to the client. Conversely, not requiring the involvement of employees in intentional wrongdoing would allow for a more consistent application of the principle that standard terms and conditions must be adequately communicated to be enforceable. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which emphasize fairness, transparency, and informed consent in contractual relationships.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the involvement of the defendant's employees in intentional wrongdoing (factor m), which was present in Bewise Motors Company Limited v Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd, we have the additional factor of explicit mention of standard terms and conditions on the verification sheet (factor n). This factor n, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of inadequate notice of terms (fact pattern i*), serves a similar function to factor m in the precedent case. Given the presence of factor n, we submit that the reasoning in Bewise Motors Company Limited v Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as fairness, transparency, and informed consent would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. Therefore, Sparkling Bright should not be able to rely on the WMA conditions to limit its liability for the damage to S&A's laptop, and it should resume weekly cleanings as per the original agreement.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to Bewise Motors Company Limited v Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the issue of whether standard terms and conditions were adequately brought to the attention of the contracting party and the negligence of the service provider's employees. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the explicit mention of standard terms and conditions on the verification sheet in the current case, which was not present in the precedent.

The proposed legal rule from Bewise Motors Company Limited v Hoi Kong Container Services Co Ltd—that standard terms and conditions not adequately brought to the attention of the contracting party should not be incorporated into the contract—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the explicit mention of terms in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the argument that the explicit mention of standard terms on the verification sheet provides a reasonable opportunity for the client to inquire about these terms, and the counterargument that the terms were still not adequately communicated.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, transparency, and informed consent in contractual relationships, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Sparkling Bright should not be able to rely on the WMA conditions to limit its liability for the damage to S&A's laptop. The explicit mention of terms on the verification sheet, while a step towards better communication, does not fully meet the standard of adequately bringing those terms to the client's attention, especially given the small font and the context in which it was presented.

Therefore, Sparkling Bright is liable for the damage to the laptop caused by its employee's negligence. Additionally, Sparkling Bright should resume weekly cleanings as per the original agreement, as the temporary reduction was conditional and S&A has now requested the resumption of the original service level.

This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by ensuring that parties are fully aware of and consent to contractual terms, thereby promoting transparency and fairness in contractual relationships.

### Minor Premise:

1. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 8 Subsection 1:
   - S&A is not dealing as a consumer but as a business entity.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

2. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 7 Subsections 1 and 2:
   - The term in the WMA conditions attempts to exclude liability for negligence.
   - The exclusion clause does not satisfy the requirement of reasonableness as it was not explicitly agreed upon in the main contract and was only mentioned in small print on a verification sheet.
   - Therefore, Sparkling Bright cannot exclude or restrict its liability for the damage to the laptop.

3. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 7 Subsection 3:
   - The term in the WMA conditions purports to exclude liability for negligence.
   - S&A’s office manager’s agreement to or awareness of the verification sheet is not of itself to be taken as indicating voluntary acceptance of any risk.
   - Therefore, this section supports that the exclusion clause is not valid.

4. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 13 Subsection 1:
   - The contract term (WMA conditions) has to satisfy the requirement of reasonableness.
   - The contract has not been terminated by breach or by a party electing to treat it as repudiated.

### Conclusion:

Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 7 Subsections 1, 2, and 3 apply. Sparkling Bright cannot successfully rely on the exclusion clause to resist S&A's demand for compensation for the laptop. Therefore, Sparkling Bright must compensate S&A for the damaged laptop. Additionally, Sparkling Bright must resume weekly cleanings as per the original agreement, as the temporary reduction was conditional and the condition (office remaining spick and span) was not met.

Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited

### Major Premise:

1. Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited

   Conditions:
   - The contract contains an exclusion clause.
   - The exclusion clause is clear and unambiguous.
   - The exclusion clause does not negate the primary purpose of the contract.
   - The exclusion clause is construed in the context of the contract as a whole.

   Consequences:
   - The exclusion clause may be effective in exempting the party from liability.

   Exceptions:
   - The exclusion clause is ambiguous.
   - The exclusion clause negates the primary purpose of the contract.
   - The exclusion clause is not clear and unambiguous.

2. Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited

   Conditions:
   - An exemption clause is included in a contract.
   - The clause is clear and unambiguous in its language.
   - The clause is construed in the context of the contract as a whole, taking into account its nature and purpose.
   - The clause does not negate the primary contractual purpose.

   Consequences:
   - The exemption clause may be effective in excluding liability for certain breaches.

   Exceptions:
   - The clause is ambiguous.
   - The clause negates the primary contractual purpose.
   - The clause is not clear and unambiguous.

### Minor Premise:

1. Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited:

   - The contract between Sparkling Bright and S&A did not explicitly contain an exclusion clause.
   - The verification sheet signed by S&A’s office manager referred to standard WMA conditions, which include an exclusion clause.
   - The exclusion clause in the WMA conditions is clear and unambiguous in its language.
   - The exclusion clause does not negate the primary purpose of the contract, which is to provide cleaning services.
   - The exclusion clause is construed in the context of the contract as a whole, considering the reference to WMA conditions on the verification sheet.

   Therefore, the exclusion clause may be effective in exempting Sparkling Bright from liability for the damaged laptop.

2. Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited:

   - An exemption clause is included in the WMA conditions, which are referenced in the verification sheet.
   - The clause is clear and unambiguous in its language.
   - The clause is construed in the context of the contract as a whole, taking into account its nature and purpose.
   - The clause does not negate the primary contractual purpose, which is to provide cleaning services.

   Therefore, the exemption clause may be effective in excluding liability for the damaged laptop.

### Conclusion:

The exclusion clause referenced in the WMA conditions is clear and unambiguous, does not negate the primary purpose of the contract, and is construed in the context of the contract as a whole. Therefore, Sparkling Bright can successfully rely on the exclusion clause to resist S&A's demand for compensation for the laptop.

Regarding the demand to resume weekly cleanings immediately, this is a separate issue from the exclusion clause. The agreement to reduce the frequency of cleanings was conditional on the office remaining "spick and span." Given the damage incident and the upcoming important guests, S&A may argue that the condition was not met. Sparkling Bright should negotiate with S&A to address their concerns and possibly resume weekly cleanings to maintain the business relationship.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA 2310/2014 BETWEEN CHAU KEI MAN RAYMAN Plaintiff and CHATERS AUCTION LIMITED Defendant)

In the case of HCA 2310/2014 BETWEEN CHAU KEI MAN RAYMAN Plaintiff and CHATERS AUCTION LIMITED Defendant (precedent p), the plaintiff, Chau Kei Man Rayman, claimed that the defendant, Chater's Auction Limited, was negligent in handling his teapots, resulting in damage to four of the five teapots. The court ruled that the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff and was in breach of this duty by not taking reasonable care to avoid damage to the teapots. The court also found that the exemption clauses in the contract were not clear enough to exempt the defendant from liability for negligence and that the defendant failed to discharge its burden of proving that the exemption clauses were fair and reasonable under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap 71). Therefore, the court held the defendant liable for the damage to the teapots and ordered the return of the teapots to the plaintiff.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in HCA 2310/2014 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Duty of Care**: In HCA 2310/2014, the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff to handle the teapots with reasonable care. Similarly, in our current case, Sparkling Bright owes a duty of care to S&A to handle their property, including the laptop, with reasonable care during the cleaning services.
- **Breach of Duty**: In HCA 2310/2014, the defendant breached the duty of care by not taking reasonable care to avoid damage to the teapots. In our current case, Sparkling Bright's sanitary engineer, Sam, breached the duty of care by negligently spilling soap water on the laptop while performing a TikTok challenge.
- **Exemption Clauses**: In HCA 2310/2014, the court found that the exemption clauses were not clear enough to exempt the defendant from liability for negligence. In our current case, Sparkling Bright is attempting to rely on an exemption clause in the WMA standard conditions to avoid liability for the damaged laptop.
- **Reasonableness Test**: In HCA 2310/2014, the court applied the reasonableness test under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap 71) to determine the validity of the exemption clauses. In our current case, the reasonableness of the exemption clause in the WMA standard conditions will also be a key factor in determining whether Sparkling Bright can rely on it to avoid liability.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA 2310/2014)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a duty of care being breached and an unclear or unreasonable exemption clause, the court should decide that the exemption clause does not exempt the defendant from liability for negligence. This rule was justified in HCA 2310/2014 because the positive effects (E+) of holding the defendant liable for negligence, such as upholding the duty of care and ensuring fair treatment of the plaintiff, outweighed the negative effects (E-) of allowing the defendant to escape liability through unclear or unreasonable exemption clauses.

Applying this rule to our current case, Sparkling Bright cannot successfully rely on the exemption clause in the WMA standard conditions to avoid liability for the damaged laptop. The clause is not clear and unambiguous enough to exempt Sparkling Bright from liability for negligence, and it is unlikely to pass the reasonableness test under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap 71). Therefore, Sparkling Bright should be held liable for the damage to the laptop and cannot resist S&A's demand for compensation. Additionally, Sparkling Bright should resume weekly cleanings as per the original agreement, as the temporary reduction was conditional on maintaining the office in a satisfactory condition, which was not met due to the incident.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA 2310/2014 BETWEEN CHAU KEI MAN RAYMAN Plaintiff and CHATERS AUCTION LIMITED Defendant) are present:

- **Duty of Care**: Sparkling Bright owes a duty of care to S&A to handle their property, including the laptop, with reasonable care during the cleaning services. This is similar to the duty of care owed by Chater's Auction Limited to Chau Kei Man Rayman to handle the teapots with reasonable care.
- **Breach of Duty**: Sparkling Bright's sanitary engineer, Sam, breached the duty of care by negligently spilling soap water on the laptop while performing a TikTok challenge. This mirrors the breach of duty by Chater's Auction Limited in not taking reasonable care to avoid damage to the teapots.
- **Exemption Clauses**: Sparkling Bright is attempting to rely on an exemption clause in the WMA standard conditions to avoid liability for the damaged laptop. In the precedent case, the court found that the exemption clauses were not clear enough to exempt the defendant from liability for negligence.
- **Reasonableness Test**: The reasonableness of the exemption clause in the WMA standard conditions will be a key factor in determining whether Sparkling Bright can rely on it to avoid liability. In the precedent case, the court applied the reasonableness test under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap 71) to determine the validity of the exemption clauses.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in the precedent case. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA 2310/2014, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding the Duty of Care**: Holding Sparkling Bright liable for the damage to the laptop would reinforce the importance of maintaining a duty of care in contractual relationships, ensuring that service providers act responsibly and diligently.
2. **Ensuring Fair Treatment**: By not allowing Sparkling Bright to escape liability through an unclear or unreasonable exemption clause, the court would ensure fair treatment of S&A, who entrusted their property to Sparkling Bright.
3. **Promoting Clarity in Contracts**: This decision would encourage parties to draft clear and unambiguous exemption clauses, promoting transparency and reducing the likelihood of disputes over contractual terms.
4. **Consumer Protection**: Applying the reasonableness test under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap 71) would protect consumers from unfair contract terms, ensuring that exemption clauses are fair and reasonable in all circumstances.

Therefore, Sparkling Bright cannot successfully rely on the exemption clause in the WMA standard conditions to avoid liability for the damaged laptop. The clause is not clear and unambiguous enough to exempt Sparkling Bright from liability for negligence, and it is unlikely to pass the reasonableness test under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap 71). Consequently, Sparkling Bright should be held liable for the damage to the laptop and cannot resist S&A's demand for compensation. Additionally, Sparkling Bright should resume weekly cleanings as per the original agreement, as the temporary reduction was conditional on maintaining the office in a satisfactory condition, which was not met due to the incident.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the presence of a verification sheet signed by S&A’s office manager, that was not present in HCA 2310/2014 BETWEEN CHAU KEI MAN RAYMAN Plaintiff and CHATERS AUCTION LIMITED Defendant. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of duty of care and exemption clauses.

In the precedent case, there was no equivalent document signed by the plaintiff that acknowledged the terms and conditions under which the service was provided. The verification sheet in our current case, signed by S&A’s office manager, explicitly references the WMA standard conditions, which include an exemption clause. This signed document could be interpreted as an acknowledgment and acceptance of those terms by S&A, thereby potentially strengthening Sparkling Bright's position.

Because of this signed verification sheet, applying the same outcome as in the precedent case would have more negative consequences, such as undermining the principle of contractual freedom and the enforceability of agreed terms, than positive ones. Unlike in HCA 2310/2014, where the exemption clause was not clearly communicated or agreed upon, the signed verification sheet in our case suggests that S&A had an opportunity to review and accept the WMA standard conditions, including the exemption clause. Therefore, the presence of this signed document significantly impacts the balance of positive and negative effects, making it less straightforward to hold Sparkling Bright liable in the same manner as Chater's Auction Limited was held liable in the precedent case.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from HCA 2310/2014 BETWEEN CHAU KEI MAN RAYMAN Plaintiff and CHATERS AUCTION LIMITED Defendant should be stated as: "When both a duty of care is breached and an exemption clause is not clearly communicated or agreed upon, the court should decide that the exemption clause does not exempt the defendant from liability for negligence." Omitting the presence of a signed verification sheet (m) from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of undermining the principle of contractual freedom and the enforceability of agreed terms. Indeed, the opinion in HCA 2310/2014 explicitly states that the exemption clauses were not clear enough to exempt the defendant from liability for negligence, highlighting the importance of clear communication and agreement on such clauses.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in HCA 2310/2014 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of service providers escaping liability through unclear or unreasonable exemption clauses, thereby ensuring fair treatment of the plaintiff and upholding the duty of care. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because the signed verification sheet suggests that S&A had an opportunity to review and accept the WMA standard conditions, including the exemption clause. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—preventing unfair surprise and ensuring clear communication of exemption clauses—is not relevant to our situation where the terms were arguably communicated and acknowledged by S&A.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the explicit absence of a signed verification sheet, which was present in the precedent case HCA 2310/2014 BETWEEN CHAU KEI MAN RAYMAN Plaintiff and CHATERS AUCTION LIMITED Defendant, requiring this factor for all similar cases of duty of care and exemption clauses would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would undermine the principle of contractual freedom and the enforceability of agreed terms. Conversely, not requiring the absence of a signed verification sheet would allow for a more balanced approach that considers the context and the parties' understanding of the terms, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and reasonableness in contract law. This approach ensures that exemption clauses are not used to unfairly absolve parties from their duty of care while still respecting the parties' autonomy to agree on terms.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the explicit absence of a signed verification sheet, which was present in HCA 2310/2014, we have the additional factor of the signed verification sheet that references the WMA standard conditions. This signed verification sheet, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of duty of care and exemption clauses, serves a similar function to the absence of clear communication in the precedent case. Given the presence of the signed verification sheet, we submit that the reasoning in HCA 2310/2014 still applies, as the positive effects on upholding the duty of care and ensuring fair treatment would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. The signed verification sheet indicates that S&A had an opportunity to review and accept the terms, which strengthens Sparkling Bright's position but does not entirely absolve them from their duty of care. Therefore, Sparkling Bright should still be held liable for the damage to the laptop, and the exemption clause should be scrutinized for its clarity and reasonableness.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA 2310/2014 BETWEEN CHAU KEI MAN RAYMAN Plaintiff and CHATERS AUCTION LIMITED Defendant, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of a duty of care, a breach of that duty, and the reliance on an exemption clause. However, it also differs in a significant way: the presence of a signed verification sheet referencing the WMA standard conditions, which was not present in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case—that when both a duty of care is breached and an exemption clause is not clearly communicated or agreed upon, the court should decide that the exemption clause does not exempt the defendant from liability for negligence—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the signed verification sheet in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides. A strong point from the initial analogy is that the duty of care and the reasonableness of exemption clauses are crucial in ensuring fair treatment and upholding contractual obligations. On the other hand, a strong point from the rebuttal is that the signed verification sheet suggests that S&A had an opportunity to review and accept the WMA standard conditions, which could imply acceptance of the exemption clause.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, reasonableness, and the importance of clear communication in contractual terms, we conclude that Sparkling Bright cannot entirely rely on the exemption clause to avoid liability for the damaged laptop. The clause, while referenced in the signed verification sheet, still needs to pass the reasonableness test under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap 71). Given the circumstances, including the negligent act of the sanitary engineer, it is unlikely that the exemption clause would be deemed fair and reasonable.

Therefore, Sparkling Bright should be held liable for the damage to the laptop and cannot resist S&A's demand for compensation. Additionally, Sparkling Bright should resume weekly cleanings as per the original agreement, as the temporary reduction was conditional on maintaining the office in a satisfactory condition, which was not met due to the incident.

This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency, ensuring that exemption clauses are not used to unfairly absolve parties from their duty of care.

   - S&A is not dealing as a consumer but as a business entity.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

7. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 9 Subsection 1:
   - S&A is not dealing as a consumer but as a business entity.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

### Conclusion:

None of the sections from the Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 or the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 apply because S&A is not dealing as a consumer but as a business entity. Therefore, Sparkling Bright can successfully resist S&A’s demands based on the exclusion clause in the WMA standard conditions.

## Deductive Reasoning: ca

### Relevant law:

Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (CECO)

### Major Premise:

1. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (CECO)

   Conditions:
   - The clauses in question are provisions which exclude or restrict the relevant obligation or duty of the service provider.
   - The service provider seeks to rely on these clauses to avoid liability for negligence.

   Consequences:
   - The clauses would not be effective to exclude or restrict liability for negligence unless they satisfied the requirement of reasonableness in the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (CECO).

   Exceptions:
   - The clauses are fair and reasonable ones to be included having regard to the circumstances of the case.

   Citation:
   - Chang Pui Yin v Bank of Singapore Limited

### Minor Premise:

1. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (CECO):
   - The clause in the WMA standard conditions is a provision that excludes or restricts the relevant obligation or duty of Sparkling Bright (the service provider).
   - Sparkling Bright seeks to rely on this clause to avoid liability for the damage caused to S&A's laptop due to negligence.
   - The clause would not be effective to exclude or restrict liability for negligence unless it satisfies the requirement of reasonableness under CECO.
   - The clause must be fair and reasonable to be included, having regard to the circumstances of the case.

### Analysis:

- The agreement between Sparkling Bright and S&A was silent on liability for property damage.
- The exclusion clause was not explicitly brought to S&A's attention at the time of contract formation but was included in the verification sheet signed after the first cleaning service.
- The clause in the WMA standard conditions attempts to exclude liability for "any damages or losses the client might suffer as a result of any act or omission, however caused, by the service provider’s employees, servants or agents."
- The damage to the laptop was caused by the negligence of Sparkling Bright's employee, Sam, who was engaging in a TikTok challenge while performing his duties.
- The reasonableness of the exclusion clause must be assessed under CECO, considering factors such as the bargaining power of the parties, whether the clause was brought to the attention of S&A, and the nature of the negligence involved.

### Conclusion:

Given the circumstances, it is unlikely that the exclusion clause in the WMA standard conditions would satisfy the requirement of reasonableness under CECO. The clause was not explicitly brought to S&A's attention at the time of contract formation, and the negligence involved was significant (engaging in a TikTok challenge while working). Therefore, Sparkling Bright cannot successfully rely on the exclusion clause to resist S&A's demand for compensation for the damaged laptop.

Regarding the demand to resume weekly cleanings, the temporary reduction in cleaning frequency was agreed upon by both parties, with the condition that the office remains "spick and span." Given the importance of the upcoming guests and the agreement's terms, Sparkling Bright should comply with S&A's request to resume weekly cleanings immediately.

### Final Conclusion:

Sparkling Bright cannot successfully resist S&A's demand for compensation for the damaged laptop. Additionally, Sparkling Bright should comply with S&A's request to resume weekly cleanings immediately.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited)
In the case of Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited (precedent p), the court ruled that a carrier of goods shipped under a straight bill of lading is potentially liable for breach of contract or in conversion if it releases those goods without production of the original bill of lading. The court emphasized that the presentation rule, which requires the production of the bill of lading for delivery of goods, is a cardinal purpose of the contract and cannot be negated by an exclusion clause unless the clause is clear and unambiguous.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Exclusion Clauses**: In both cases, there is an attempt to rely on an exclusion clause to avoid liability.
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In Carewins, the carrier relied on an exclusion clause to avoid liability for misdelivery. In our current case, Sparkling Bright relies on the WMA standard conditions to avoid liability for damage to the laptop.
- **Legal Concept 2: Clarity and Ambiguity of Exclusion Clauses**: The court in Carewins emphasized that exclusion clauses must be clear and unambiguous to be enforceable.
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In Carewins, the exclusion clause was scrutinized for clarity and ambiguity. In our current case, the WMA standard conditions were not explicitly agreed upon in the initial contract and were only referenced in small print on a verification sheet.
- **Legal Concept 3: Fundamental Purpose of the Contract**: The court in Carewins highlighted that exclusion clauses should not negate the fundamental purpose of the contract.
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In Carewins, the fundamental purpose was the delivery of goods against the presentation of the bill of lading. In our current case, the fundamental purpose is the provision of cleaning services without causing damage to property.
- **Legal Concept 4: Incorporation of Terms by Reference**: The court in Carewins considered whether terms referenced in a document were effectively incorporated into the contract.
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In Carewins, the terms were part of the bill of lading. In our current case, the WMA standard conditions were referenced in the verification sheet signed after the initial agreement.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern where an exclusion clause is relied upon to avoid liability, the court should decide that the exclusion clause is enforceable only if it is clear, unambiguous, and does not negate the fundamental purpose of the contract. This rule was justified in Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that exclusion clauses do not undermine the core obligations of the contract outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially limiting the scope of exclusion clauses in commercial agreements.

Applying this rule to our current case, Sparkling Bright may face difficulty in successfully resisting S&A’s demands for the following reasons:
1. **Clarity and Ambiguity**: The WMA standard conditions were not explicitly agreed upon in the initial contract and were only referenced in small print on a verification sheet. This may not meet the requirement of being clear and unambiguous.
2. **Fundamental Purpose**: The fundamental purpose of the contract is to provide cleaning services without causing damage to property. The exclusion clause in the WMA standard conditions, if enforced, would negate this fundamental purpose.
3. **Incorporation by Reference**: The WMA standard conditions were referenced after the initial agreement, which may not be sufficient for their incorporation into the contract.

Therefore, Sparkling Bright may not be able to rely on the WMA standard conditions to avoid liability for the damaged laptop and may need to resume weekly cleanings as per S&A’s demand.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Exclusion Clauses**: In both cases, there is an attempt to rely on an exclusion clause to avoid liability.
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In Carewins, the carrier relied on an exclusion clause to avoid liability for misdelivery. In our current case, Sparkling Bright relies on the WMA standard conditions to avoid liability for damage to the laptop.

- **Legal Concept 2: Clarity and Ambiguity of Exclusion Clauses**: The court in Carewins emphasized that exclusion clauses must be clear and unambiguous to be enforceable.
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In Carewins, the exclusion clause was scrutinized for clarity and ambiguity. In our current case, the WMA standard conditions were not explicitly agreed upon in the initial contract and were only referenced in small print on a verification sheet.

- **Legal Concept 3: Fundamental Purpose of the Contract**: The court in Carewins highlighted that exclusion clauses should not negate the fundamental purpose of the contract.
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In Carewins, the fundamental purpose was the delivery of goods against the presentation of the bill of lading. In our current case, the fundamental purpose is the provision of cleaning services without causing damage to property.

- **Legal Concept 4: Incorporation of Terms by Reference**: The court in Carewins considered whether terms referenced in a document were effectively incorporated into the contract.
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In Carewins, the terms were part of the bill of lading. In our current case, the WMA standard conditions were referenced in the verification sheet signed after the initial agreement.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited. This decision would be justified because, as in Carewins, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Clarity and Certainty in Contracts**: By requiring exclusion clauses to be clear and unambiguous, the court would promote transparency and certainty in contractual relationships. This would ensure that parties are fully aware of their rights and obligations, thereby reducing the likelihood of disputes.

2. **Protecting Fundamental Contractual Purposes**: By not allowing exclusion clauses to negate the fundamental purpose of the contract, the court would uphold the core obligations that parties have agreed upon. This would ensure that the primary objectives of the contract are met, providing fairness and balance in commercial transactions.

3. **Encouraging Proper Incorporation of Terms**: By scrutinizing the incorporation of terms by reference, the court would encourage parties to explicitly agree on all significant terms at the time of contract formation. This would prevent parties from unilaterally imposing additional terms after the contract has been signed, thereby protecting the interests of both parties.

4. **Promoting Accountability and Responsibility**: By holding service providers accountable for damages caused by their employees, the court would promote a culture of responsibility and diligence. This would incentivize service providers to take necessary precautions to prevent harm, thereby enhancing the overall quality of services provided.

Therefore, Sparkling Bright may not be able to rely on the WMA standard conditions to avoid liability for the damaged laptop and may need to resume weekly cleanings as per S&A’s demand. This decision would be justified because it aligns with the principles established in Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited and promotes fairness, clarity, and accountability in contractual relationships.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the **presentation rule**. The presentation rule was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling (ensuring the proper delivery of goods only against the production of the bill of lading) outweighed any potential drawbacks (limiting the scope of exclusion clauses) because it upheld the fundamental purpose of the contract and provided clarity and certainty in commercial transactions. However, in our current case, this crucial **presentation rule** is notably absent as the contract between Sparkling Bright and S&A does not involve the delivery of goods against a bill of lading but rather the provision of cleaning services.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor **(the reference to WMA standard conditions in the verification sheet)** that was not present in **Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern **(incorporation of terms by reference)** because the WMA standard conditions were referenced after the initial agreement and were not explicitly agreed upon at the time of contract formation. Due to **the reference to WMA standard conditions in the verification sheet**, applying the same outcome (holding the exclusion clause unenforceable) in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the principle of freedom of contract and the ability of parties to agree on terms post-contract formation than positive ones, unlike in **Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited** because the reference to WMA standard conditions introduces an element of post-contractual agreement that was not present in the precedent case.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited** should be stated as 'When both **[exclusion clauses]** and **[the fundamental purpose of the contract]** are present, the court should decide **[the exclusion clause is enforceable only if it is clear, unambiguous, and does not negate the fundamental purpose of the contract]**.' Omitting **[the fundamental purpose of the contract]** from this rule could lead to **[the undesirable consequence of allowing exclusion clauses to undermine the core obligations of the contract, thereby creating uncertainty and unfairness in contractual relationships]**. Indeed, the opinion in **Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited** explicitly states that **the fundamental purpose of the contract was crucial to their decision**.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited** was clearly designed to prevent **the undesirable consequence of undermining the fundamental purpose of the contract by allowing broad exclusion clauses to negate core obligations**. However, in our current case, there's no risk of **undermining the fundamental purpose of the contract** occurring because the reference to the WMA standard conditions in the verification sheet introduces an element of post-contractual agreement that was not present in the precedent case. Therefore, applying **the precedent's rule** here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the **presentation rule**, which was present in the precedent case **Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of **exclusion clauses** would lead to the undesirable consequence of allowing service providers to evade liability for damages caused by their negligence or misconduct, thereby undermining the fundamental purpose of the contract. Conversely, not requiring the **presentation rule** would allow for the desirable outcome of holding service providers accountable for their actions, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, such as fairness, accountability, and the protection of contractual obligations.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the **presentation rule**, which was present in **Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited**, we have the additional factor of **the reference to WMA standard conditions in the verification sheet**. This **reference to WMA standard conditions**, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of **exclusion clauses**, serves a similar function to the **presentation rule** in the precedent case. Given the presence of **the reference to WMA standard conditions**, we submit that the reasoning in **Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited** still applies, as the positive effects on **clarity, accountability, and the protection of fundamental contractual purposes** would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the reliance on an exclusion clause to avoid liability and the need for clarity and unambiguity in such clauses. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of the presentation rule and the post-contractual reference to the WMA standard conditions.

The proposed legal rule of "the exclusion clause is enforceable only if it is clear, unambiguous, and does not negate the fundamental purpose of the contract" finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the need for clarity and certainty in contracts (as emphasized in **Carewins**) and the potential for undermining the fundamental purpose of the contract if broad exclusion clauses are allowed (as argued in the current case).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, accountability, and the protection of fundamental contractual purposes, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Sparkling Bright may not be able to rely on the WMA standard conditions to avoid liability for the damaged laptop. The exclusion clause referenced in the verification sheet is not sufficiently clear and unambiguous, and enforcing it would negate the fundamental purpose of the contract, which is to provide cleaning services without causing damage to property.

Therefore, Sparkling Bright should be held liable for the damage to the laptop and should resume weekly cleanings as per S&A’s demand. This decision aligns with the principles established in **Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited** and promotes fairness, clarity, and accountability in contractual relationships.

### Minor Premise:

1. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 7 Subsection 2:
- S&A deals as a consumer with Sparkling Bright.
- The WMA standard conditions purport to exclude or restrict liability for negligence.
- The term does not satisfy the requirement of reasonableness as it was not explicitly agreed upon in the original contract and was only mentioned in small print on a verification sheet after the contract was signed.
- Therefore, Sparkling Bright cannot exclude or restrict its liability for negligence.

2. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 7 Subsection 3:
- The WMA standard conditions purport to exclude or restrict liability for negligence.
- S&A’s office manager’s agreement to or awareness of the term on the verification sheet is not of itself to be taken as indicating voluntary acceptance of any risk.
- Therefore, S&A’s agreement to the term does not indicate voluntary acceptance of the risk.

3. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 9 Subsection 1:
- S&A deals as a consumer with Sparkling Bright.
- The WMA standard conditions purport to indemnify Sparkling Bright in respect of liability for negligence.
- The term does not satisfy the requirement of reasonableness as it was not explicitly agreed upon in the original contract and was only mentioned in small print on a verification sheet after the contract was signed.
- Therefore, S&A cannot be made to indemnify Sparkling Bright in respect of liability for negligence.

4. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 8 Subsection 1:
- S&A deals as a consumer with Sparkling Bright.
- The WMA standard conditions purport to exclude or restrict any liability arising under the contract by virtue of the Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance.
- Therefore, Sparkling Bright cannot exclude or restrict any liability arising under the contract by virtue of the Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance.

### Conclusion:

Sparkling Bright cannot successfully resist S&A’s demands for compensation for the damaged laptop and the resumption of weekly cleanings. The exclusion clause in the WMA standard conditions is not enforceable as it does not satisfy the requirement of reasonableness and was not explicitly agreed upon in the original contract.

## Deductive Reasoning: ca

### Relevant law:

Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (CECO) and Unconscionable Contracts Ordinance (UCO)

### Major Premise:

1. Chang Pui Yin & Ors v Bank of Singapore Limited

   Conditions:
   - The clauses in question are provisions which exclude or restrict the relevant obligation or duty of the service provider.
   - The clauses do not satisfy the requirement of reasonableness under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (CECO).
   - The service provider's conduct misleads the client into believing that the service provider will act in their best interest and according to their investment objectives and risk appetite.

   Consequences:
   - The clauses will be deemed unconscionable and the service provider cannot rely on those clauses to avoid liabilities.

   Exceptions:
   - The service provider clearly informs the client that they are only acting as a salesperson and the recommendations might not be consistent with the client's objectives.
   - The service provider takes reasonable steps to ensure the client understands the risk level of the products recommended.

2. Chang Pui Yin v Bank of Singapore Limited

   Conditions:
   - The terms of a contract are unconscionable in the circumstances relating to the contract at the time it was made, considering factors such as the relative strengths of the bargaining positions of the consumer and the other party, whether the consumer was required to comply with conditions that were not reasonably necessary for the protection of the legitimate interests of the other party, whether the consumer was able to understand any documents relating to the supply or possible supply of the goods or services, whether any undue influence or pressure was exerted on, or any unfair tactics were used against, the consumer, and the amount for which, and the circumstances under which, the consumer could have acquired identical or equivalent goods or services from a person other than the other party.

   Consequences:
   - The court may find the contract or part of the contract to be unconscionable and may exercise its power to limit the application of such terms to avoid the unconscionable result.

   Exceptions:
   - The circumstances leading to the unconscionability were not reasonably foreseeable at the time the contract was made.

3. Chang Pui Yin v Bank of Singapore Limited

   Conditions:
   - The terms relied upon by the Bank are standard terms in the Services Agreements and the Risk Disclosure Statements.
   - The court finds that the terms are unconscionable in the circumstances relating to the contract at the time it was made.
   - The court has regard to all circumstances relevant to the determination if a part of a contract is unconscionable, including the non-exhaustive list of factors in Section 6(1) of the UCO.

   Consequences:
   - The court may grant relief in respect of the contract, including the enforcement of the contract without the unconscionable part or limit the application of, or revise or alter, any unconscionable part so as to avoid any unconscionable result.

   Exceptions:
   - The circumstances that are claimed to make the contract unconscionable were not reasonably foreseeable at the time the contract was made.

### Minor Premise:

1. Chang Pui Yin & Ors v Bank of Singapore Limited:
   - The clause in the WMA standard conditions excludes or restricts the relevant obligation or duty of Sparkling Bright.
   - The clause does not satisfy the requirement of reasonableness under the CECO because it completely absolves Sparkling Bright from any liability for damages or losses caused by its employees, which is likely to be deemed unreasonable.
   - Sparkling Bright's conduct did not mislead S&A into believing that Sparkling Bright would act in their best interest and according to their investment objectives and risk appetite, as this is a cleaning service contract, not an investment service.

   Therefore, this section does not apply.

2. Chang Pui Yin v Bank of Singapore Limited:
   - The terms of the WMA standard conditions are unconscionable in the circumstances relating to the contract at the time it was made, considering:
     * The relative strengths of the bargaining positions of S&A and Sparkling Bright.
     * S&A was not required to comply with conditions that were not reasonably necessary for the protection of Sparkling Bright's legitimate interests.
     * S&A may not have been able to understand the small print on the verification sheet.
     * No undue influence or pressure was exerted on S&A, but the term was hidden in small print.
     * S&A could have acquired cleaning services from another provider without such an exclusion clause.

   Therefore, this section applies.

3. Chang Pui Yin v Bank of Singapore Limited:
   - The terms relied upon by Sparkling Bright are standard terms in the WMA conditions.
   - The court would likely find that the terms are unconscionable in the circumstances relating to the contract at the time it was made.
   - The court would have regard to all circumstances relevant to the determination if a part of a contract is unconscionable, including the non-exhaustive list of factors in Section 6(1) of the UCO.

   Therefore, this section applies.

### Conclusion:

The exclusion clause in the WMA standard conditions is likely to be deemed unconscionable under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (CECO) and the Unconscionable Contracts Ordinance (UCO). Sparkling Bright cannot successfully rely on this clause to avoid liability for the damaged laptop. Therefore, Sparkling Bright cannot resist S&A’s demand for compensation for the laptop. However, the demand to resume weekly cleanings immediately is a separate contractual issue and would depend on the specific terms of the agreement and any subsequent modifications agreed upon by both parties.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE)
In the case of HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE (precedent p), the plaintiffs alleged negligence and breach of duty in the safekeeping and proper delivery of cargo. The court ruled that the defendants could not rely on an exclusion clause to avoid liability for negligence unless they could show that they had exercised reasonable diligence. The court also emphasized that exclusion clauses must be construed contra proferentem, meaning any ambiguity should be resolved against the party seeking to rely on the clause.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Exclusion Clauses**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the service provider included an exclusion clause in the contract to limit or exclude liability for damages.
- **Legal Concept 2: Contra Proferentem Rule**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: The exclusion clause was not clearly communicated or was ambiguous, leading to the application of the contra proferentem rule.
- **Legal Concept 3: Reasonable Diligence**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: The service provider's liability hinged on whether they exercised reasonable diligence in performing their duties.
- **Legal Concept 4: Public Policy and Unconscionability**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: The court considered whether the exclusion clause was unconscionable or contrary to public policy.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of an exclusion clause that is ambiguous or not clearly communicated (fact pattern i*), the court should decide that the clause cannot be relied upon to exclude liability unless the service provider can show they exercised reasonable diligence (outcome o). This rule was justified in HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that service providers cannot easily escape liability for negligence outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially limiting the enforceability of exclusion clauses. This approach upholds the principles of fairness and accountability in contractual relationships.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Exclusion Clauses**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: Sparkling Bright included an exclusion clause in the verification sheet, which refers to the WMA standard conditions that limit liability for damages caused by the service provider's employees, servants, or agents.

- **Legal Concept 2: Contra Proferentem Rule**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: The exclusion clause was not clearly communicated to S&A. It was printed in small font at the bottom of the verification sheet and was not explicitly brought to S&A's attention at the time of signing the agreement.

- **Legal Concept 3: Reasonable Diligence**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: The liability of Sparkling Bright hinges on whether they exercised reasonable diligence in performing their cleaning duties. The accident involving Sam spilling soap water on the laptop while performing a TikTok challenge suggests a lack of reasonable diligence.

- **Legal Concept 4: Public Policy and Unconscionability**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: The court must consider whether the exclusion clause is unconscionable or contrary to public policy, especially given that it attempts to exclude liability for damages caused by the service provider's negligence.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Fairness and Accountability**: Ensuring that service providers cannot easily escape liability for negligence promotes fairness and accountability in contractual relationships. Sparkling Bright should not be allowed to rely on an exclusion clause that was not clearly communicated to S&A and that attempts to exclude liability for negligent acts.

2. **Consumer Protection**: Protecting clients from unfair exclusion clauses that they were not adequately informed about upholds consumer rights and prevents service providers from taking advantage of their clients.

3. **Encouraging Diligence**: Requiring service providers to exercise reasonable diligence in performing their duties ensures that they maintain high standards of care and professionalism, which benefits all parties involved.

4. **Public Policy**: Exclusion clauses that attempt to absolve service providers from liability for their own negligence are generally viewed as contrary to public policy. Allowing such clauses to stand would undermine the principles of justice and equity in contractual dealings.

Therefore, Sparkling Bright cannot successfully resist S&A’s demands for compensation for the damaged laptop and the resumption of weekly cleanings. The exclusion clause in the WMA standard conditions is likely to be deemed unenforceable due to its lack of clear communication and its attempt to exclude liability for negligence, which is contrary to public policy.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the explicit reference to the WMA standard conditions in the verification sheet, that was not present in HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of an ambiguous or not clearly communicated exclusion clause. Because the verification sheet explicitly mentions the WMA standard conditions and states that copies are available on request, it provides a clearer indication of the exclusion clause's existence compared to the precedent case.

Due to this explicit reference, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as undermining the principle of freedom of contract, than positive ones, unlike in HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE. In our case, the explicit reference to the WMA standard conditions suggests that S&A had an opportunity to inquire about and review these conditions, thereby making the exclusion clause less unconscionable and more enforceable. This factor shifts the balance towards upholding the exclusion clause, provided that it was reasonably accessible to S&A, and thus alters the legal analysis and potential outcome.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE should be stated as 'When both [an exclusion clause that is ambiguous or not clearly communicated] and [the explicit reference to the exclusion clause in a document provided to the client] are present, the court should decide [that the exclusion clause cannot be relied upon to exclude liability unless the service provider can show they exercised reasonable diligence].' Omitting [the explicit reference to the exclusion clause in a document provided to the client] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of service providers being able to rely on exclusion clauses that were not adequately communicated to clients, thereby undermining fairness and accountability in contractual relationships]. Indeed, the opinion in HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE explicitly states that [the exclusion clause must be clearly communicated and any ambiguity should be resolved against the party seeking to rely on the clause].

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of service providers escaping liability for negligence through ambiguous or inadequately communicated exclusion clauses]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [this undesirable consequence occurring] because the verification sheet explicitly mentioned the WMA standard conditions and stated that copies were available on request. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The explicit reference to the WMA standard conditions provided S&A with an opportunity to inquire about and review these conditions, making the exclusion clause less unconscionable and more enforceable.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the explicit reference to the exclusion clause in the main agreement, which was present in the precedent case HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE, requiring this factor for all similar cases of ambiguous or not clearly communicated exclusion clauses would lead to the undesirable consequence of allowing service providers to escape liability through fine print or obscure references. Conversely, not requiring the explicit reference in the main agreement would allow for a more equitable outcome, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and accountability in contractual relationships. This approach ensures that exclusion clauses are clearly communicated and understood by all parties, thereby preventing service providers from taking advantage of their clients through hidden terms.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the explicit reference to the exclusion clause in the main agreement, which was present in HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE, we have the additional factor of the explicit mention of the WMA standard conditions in the verification sheet. This explicit mention, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of an ambiguous or not clearly communicated exclusion clause, serves a similar function to the explicit reference in the main agreement in the precedent case. Given the presence of this explicit mention in the verification sheet, we submit that the reasoning in HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE still applies, as the positive effects on fairness and accountability would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. This ensures that exclusion clauses are not used to unfairly limit liability without clear communication and understanding by all parties involved.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of an exclusion clause and the application of the contra proferentem rule. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the explicit mention of the WMA standard conditions in the verification sheet provided to S&A.

The proposed legal rule that exclusion clauses must be clearly communicated and any ambiguity should be resolved against the party seeking to rely on the clause finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the explicit reference to the WMA standard conditions in the verification sheet in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the exclusion clause was not clearly communicated to S&A (supporting the application of the contra proferentem rule) and the counterargument that the explicit mention of the WMA standard conditions provided S&A with an opportunity to inquire about and review these conditions (making the exclusion clause less unconscionable and more enforceable).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, accountability, and the need for clear communication in contractual relationships, we conclude that Sparkling Bright cannot successfully resist S&A’s demands for compensation for the damaged laptop. The exclusion clause in the WMA standard conditions is likely to be deemed unenforceable due to its lack of clear communication and its attempt to exclude liability for negligence, which is contrary to public policy.

However, regarding the demand for the resumption of weekly cleanings, Sparkling Bright should comply with this request as it aligns with the original terms of the agreement and the temporary reduction was only accepted by S&A under specific conditions that are no longer applicable.

Therefore, Sparkling Bright should compensate S&A for the damaged laptop and resume weekly cleanings immediately. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by ensuring that exclusion clauses are not used to unfairly limit liability without clear communication and understanding by all parties involved.
