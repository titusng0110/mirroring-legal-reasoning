## Deductive Reasoning: ca

### Relevant law:

Vember Lord Ltd v. The Swatch Group (Hong Kong) Ltd [2023] HKCA 371

### Major Premise:

1. Vember Lord Ltd v. The Swatch Group (Hong Kong) Ltd [2023] HKCA 371

   Conditions:
   - There is a contract between the parties.
   - A supervening event occurs which is not the fault of either party.
   - The event significantly changes the nature of the contractual obligations from what was agreed upon.
   - The event was not foreseeable by the parties at the time of contract formation.

   Consequences:
   - The contract may be discharged under the doctrine of frustration.

   Exceptions:
   - The contract contains provisions that allocate the risk of the event.
   - The event merely makes the contract more expensive or difficult to perform without fundamentally changing the nature of the performance.

### Minor Premise:

1. Luke's Contract:
   - There is a contract between Luke and the Yorkshire Dales Railway for the restoration of the Hamilton Flyer.
   - The Hamilton Flyer was destroyed in an explosion, a supervening event not attributable to any party.
   - The destruction of the Hamilton Flyer significantly changes the nature of Luke's contractual obligations, as the train no longer exists to be restored.
   - The explosion was not foreseeable by the parties at the time of contract formation.
   - The contract is silent on the issue of risk and damage, so no provisions allocate the risk of the event.
   - The event does not merely make the contract more expensive or difficult to perform; it fundamentally changes the nature of the performance as the subject matter of the contract no longer exists.

   Therefore, the conditions for the doctrine of frustration are satisfied, and no exceptions apply.

2. Peter's Contract:
   - There is a contract between Peter and the Yorkshire Dales Railway for the purchase of tickets for a trip on the Hamilton Flyer.
   - The Hamilton Flyer was destroyed in an explosion, a supervening event not attributable to any party.
   - The destruction of the Hamilton Flyer significantly changes the nature of Peter's contractual obligations, as the specific train he booked for the trip no longer exists.
   - The explosion was not foreseeable by the parties at the time of contract formation.
   - The contract is silent on the issue of risk and damage, so no provisions allocate the risk of the event.
   - The event does not merely make the contract more expensive or difficult to perform; it fundamentally changes the nature of the performance as the specific experience Peter sought (riding the Hamilton Flyer) is no longer possible.

   Therefore, the conditions for the doctrine of frustration are satisfied, and no exceptions apply.

### Conclusion:

The doctrine of frustration applies to discharge both Luke's and Peter's contracts with the Yorkshire Dales Railway due to the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer. Luke is entitled to recover the £5,000 he spent on the restoration work, and Peter is entitled to recover the £100 he paid for the tickets.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD)
In the case of SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD (precedent p), the court ruled that the tenant's claim of frustration due to the COVID-19 pandemic and social unrest did not raise a triable issue. The court found that the pandemic and social unrest did not fundamentally change the nature of the outstanding contractual rights and obligations from what the parties could reasonably have contemplated at the time of the execution of the Tenancy Agreement. Therefore, the doctrine of frustration did not apply to discharge the contract.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Doctrine of Frustration**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, an unforeseen event (COVID-19 pandemic in precedent p and the explosion in the current case) occurred after the contract was formed, which significantly impacted the performance of the contract.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Fundamental Change in Contractual Obligations**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In both cases, the parties argued that the unforeseen event fundamentally changed the nature of the contractual obligations. In precedent p, the tenant argued that the pandemic made it impossible to fulfill the tenancy agreement. In the current case, Luke and Peter argue that the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer makes it impossible to fulfill their respective contracts.
  
- **Legal Concept 3: Impossibility of Performance**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In both cases, the parties claimed that the unforeseen event rendered the performance of the contract impossible. In precedent p, the tenant claimed that the pandemic made it commercially impossible to operate the business. In the current case, the explosion destroyed the Hamilton Flyer, making it physically impossible for Luke to complete the restoration and for Peter to take the planned trip.
  
- **Legal Concept 4: Absence of Fault**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In both cases, the unforeseen event occurred without any fault attributable to either party. In precedent p, the pandemic was an external event beyond the control of the parties. In the current case, the explosion was an accident with no fault attributable to any party.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of an unforeseen event occurring without fault, which significantly impacts the performance of the contract but does not fundamentally change the nature of the outstanding contractual rights and obligations from what the parties could reasonably have contemplated, the court should decide that the doctrine of frustration does not apply to discharge the contract. This rule was justified in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD because the positive effects (E+) of maintaining contractual stability and predictability outweighed the negative effects (E-) of enforcing the contract under changed circumstances. The court emphasized that the doctrine of frustration should not be lightly invoked to relieve parties from imprudent commercial bargains or commercial risks.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case involving Luke and Peter, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Doctrine of Frustration**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: An unforeseen event (the explosion) occurred after the contract was formed, which significantly impacted the performance of the contract.

- **Legal Concept 2: Fundamental Change in Contractual Obligations**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: The parties argue that the unforeseen event fundamentally changed the nature of the contractual obligations. Luke argues that the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer makes it impossible to complete the restoration, and Peter argues that the destruction makes it impossible to take the planned trip.

- **Legal Concept 3: Impossibility of Performance**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: The parties claim that the unforeseen event rendered the performance of the contract impossible. The explosion destroyed the Hamilton Flyer, making it physically impossible for Luke to complete the restoration and for Peter to take the planned trip.

- **Legal Concept 4: Absence of Fault**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: The unforeseen event occurred without any fault attributable to either party. The explosion was an accident with no fault attributable to any party.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD, where the doctrine of frustration did not apply to discharge the contract. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Contractual Stability and Predictability**: Maintaining the contracts despite the unforeseen event would uphold the principle of contractual stability and predictability. Parties entering into contracts would have a clear understanding that they cannot easily escape their obligations due to unforeseen events unless those events fundamentally alter the nature of the contract.

2. **Encouragement of Risk Management**: This outcome would encourage parties to include specific provisions for risk and damage in their contracts, thereby promoting better risk management and foresight in contractual agreements.

3. **Avoidance of Imprudent Commercial Bargains**: The decision would reinforce the notion that the doctrine of frustration should not be lightly invoked to relieve parties from imprudent commercial bargains or commercial risks. This would ensure that parties are more diligent and cautious when entering into contracts.

4. **Equitable Considerations**: While the explosion was an unforeseen event, it did not fundamentally change the nature of the outstanding contractual rights and obligations from what the parties could reasonably have contemplated at the time of the execution of the contracts. Therefore, it would be equitable to hold the parties to their original agreements.

In conclusion, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD. This decision would be justified because it would uphold the principles of contractual stability, encourage better risk management, avoid relieving parties from imprudent commercial bargains, and ensure equitable treatment of the parties involved.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the tenant's business could still operate in some capacity despite the unforeseen events (COVID-19 pandemic and social unrest). This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling (upholding contractual obligations) outweighed any potential drawbacks because it demonstrated that the tenant's obligations were not fundamentally altered, and the tenant could still derive some benefit from the lease. However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as the Hamilton Flyer was completely destroyed in the explosion, making it impossible for Luke to complete the restoration and for Peter to take the planned trip. This total destruction fundamentally changes the nature of the contractual obligations, as the specific subject matter of the contracts no longer exists.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer—that was not present in **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer makes it physically impossible for Luke to complete his restoration work and for Peter to take the planned trip. Due to this complete destruction, applying the same outcome (non-application of the doctrine of frustration) in our case would have more negative consequences such as unjustly holding the parties to obligations that are now impossible to fulfill, unlike in **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD** where the tenant could still operate their business in some capacity. Therefore, the presence of this factor in our current case justifies the application of the doctrine of frustration to discharge the contracts and allow for the recovery of any monies paid or payable.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD** should be stated as: "When both [an unforeseen event occurs without fault] and [the event does not fundamentally change the nature of the outstanding contractual rights and obligations] are present, the court should decide [that the doctrine of frustration does not apply to discharge the contract]." Omitting [the event does not fundamentally change the nature of the outstanding contractual rights and obligations] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of unjustly holding parties to obligations that have become impossible to fulfill]. Indeed, the opinion in **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD** explicitly states that the tenant's business could still operate in some capacity despite the unforeseen events, which was crucial to their decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties easily escaping their contractual obligations due to unforeseen events that do not fundamentally alter the nature of the contract]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [parties escaping their obligations without a fundamental change in the contract]. The complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer fundamentally changes the nature of the contractual obligations, making it impossible for Luke to complete his restoration work and for Peter to take the planned trip. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of the tenant's business being able to operate in some capacity despite the unforeseen events, which was present in the precedent case **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of unforeseen events leading to claims of frustration would lead to the undesirable consequence of unjustly holding parties to obligations that have become impossible to fulfill. Conversely, not requiring the ability to operate in some capacity would allow for a more equitable outcome, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, such as fairness and the prevention of unjust enrichment. This approach ensures that parties are not unfairly penalized for circumstances beyond their control that fundamentally alter the nature of their contractual obligations.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of the tenant's business being able to operate in some capacity, which was present in **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD**, we have the additional factor of the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer. This complete destruction, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of an unforeseen event occurring without fault, serves a similar function to the tenant's ability to operate in the precedent case. Given the presence of the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer, we submit that the reasoning in **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD** still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as fairness and the prevention of unjust enrichment would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the occurrence of an unforeseen event without fault and the significant impact on the performance of the contract. However, it also differs in a crucial aspect: the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer, which fundamentally changes the nature of the contractual obligations.

The proposed legal rule from **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD** suggests that the doctrine of frustration does not apply when an unforeseen event does not fundamentally change the nature of the outstanding contractual rights and obligations. This rule finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer makes it physically impossible for Luke to complete his restoration work and for Peter to take the planned trip, which fundamentally alters the contractual obligations. Conversely, the precedent emphasizes the importance of maintaining contractual stability and predictability, even in the face of unforeseen events.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, the prevention of unjust enrichment, and the need for equitable treatment of the parties, we conclude that the doctrine of frustration should apply in this case. The complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer fundamentally changes the nature of the contractual obligations, making it impossible for Luke and Peter to fulfill their respective contracts. Therefore, the contracts should be discharged, and any monies paid or payable should be recoverable.

This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by recognizing the unique and significant impact of the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer on the contractual obligations.


# Contract Law: Whether Luke can recover the £5,000 he spent working on the Hamilton Flyer prior to its destruction under the doctrine of frustration

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsections 2, 3, and 6

### Major Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - A contract governed by law applicable to the Colony has become impossible of performance or been otherwise frustrated.
   - The parties thereto have for that reason been discharged from the further performance of the contract.

   Consequences:

   Exceptions:
   - None.

### Minor Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2:
- Luke entered into a contract with the Yorkshire Dales Railway to restore the Hamilton Flyer.
- The contract has become impossible of performance due to the destruction of the train in an explosion.
- The parties have been discharged from further performance of the contract.
- Luke has spent £5,000 working on the train prior to its destruction.
- Luke was due to be paid £8,000 on completion of the work.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司)

In the case of CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司 [2022] HKCFI 2646; HCA 133/2021 (precedent p), the Plaintiff claimed damages against the Defendant for breach of a Restructuring Agreement. The court ruled that the Plaintiff was entitled to damages on a reliance loss basis, amounting to HK$7,228,270, for the professional fees incurred in reliance upon the promised performance of the Defendant under the Restructuring Agreement.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Breach of Contract and Reliance Loss**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the claimant incurred expenses in reliance on the contract being performed. In the precedent case, the Plaintiff incurred professional fees; in the current case, Luke spent £5,000 working on the Hamilton Flyer.

- **Legal Concept 2: Doctrine of Frustration**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: Both cases involve situations where the performance of the contract became impossible due to unforeseen events. In the precedent case, the Defendant's withdrawal led to the impossibility of restructuring; in the current case, the explosion destroyed the Hamilton Flyer, making the completion of Luke's work impossible.

- **Legal Concept 3: Recovery of Expenditures**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In both cases, the claimant seeks to recover the expenditures incurred. In the precedent case, the Plaintiff sought to recover professional fees; in the current case, Luke seeks to recover the £5,000 spent on the train.

- **Legal Concept 4: Mitigation of Loss**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: Both cases involve the claimant taking steps to mitigate their losses. In the precedent case, the Plaintiff incurred additional costs in efforts to mitigate the loss; in the current case, Luke may argue that his expenditures were reasonable and necessary in reliance on the contract.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a claimant incurring expenditures in reliance on a contract that becomes impossible to perform due to unforeseen events, the court should decide that the claimant is entitled to recover those expenditures as reliance losses. This rule was justified in CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司 because the positive effects of allowing the claimant to recover reliance losses (E+) include upholding the principle of fairness and ensuring that parties are not left worse off due to reliance on a contract that becomes frustrated. The negative effects (E-) are minimal as the defendant's breach or the unforeseen event is the primary cause of the loss, and the claimant's expenditures were reasonable and foreseeable at the time of contracting.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Breach of Contract and Reliance Loss**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: Luke incurred expenses (£5,000) in reliance on the contract being performed, similar to the Plaintiff in the precedent case who incurred professional fees.

- **Legal Concept 2: Doctrine of Frustration**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: The performance of the contract became impossible due to an unforeseen event (the explosion), akin to the Defendant's withdrawal in the precedent case which made the restructuring impossible.

- **Legal Concept 3: Recovery of Expenditures**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: Luke seeks to recover the expenditures (£5,000) incurred, just as the Plaintiff sought to recover professional fees in the precedent case.

- **Legal Concept 4: Mitigation of Loss**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: Luke's expenditures were reasonable and necessary in reliance on the contract, similar to the Plaintiff's efforts to mitigate losses in the precedent case.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome: Luke should be entitled to recover the £5,000 spent on the Hamilton Flyer as reliance losses. This decision would be justified because, as in CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding the Principle of Fairness**: Allowing Luke to recover his reliance losses ensures that he is not left worse off due to the unforeseen event that frustrated the contract. This aligns with the principle that parties should be placed in the same situation as if the contract had been performed.

2. **Encouraging Reasonable Reliance**: By awarding reliance losses, the court reinforces the expectation that parties can reasonably rely on contracts being performed, thereby promoting trust and stability in contractual relationships.

3. **Mitigating Unjust Enrichment**: Preventing the Yorkshire Dales Railway from retaining the benefit of Luke's work without compensating him for his expenditures avoids unjust enrichment, ensuring that the loss is fairly distributed.

4. **Consistency in Legal Outcomes**: Applying the same legal principles and outcomes to similar fact patterns promotes consistency and predictability in the law, which is crucial for the integrity of the legal system.

Therefore, the court should find that the doctrine of frustration discharges Luke's contract with the Yorkshire Dales Railway and that he is entitled to recover the £5,000 spent on the Hamilton Flyer.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the Defendant had explicitly breached the Restructuring Agreement by withdrawing from the agreement without prior notice, which was a clear and direct breach of contract. This explicit breach was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling (i.e., awarding reliance losses to the Plaintiff) outweighed any potential drawbacks because it was clear that the Defendant's actions directly caused the Plaintiff's losses.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of an explicit breach by the Defendant is notably absent. The destruction of the Hamilton Flyer was due to an unforeseen explosion, and no fault is attributable to any party. Therefore, there is no direct breach of contract by the Yorkshire Dales Railway, which significantly alters the context and justification for awarding reliance losses.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the doctrine of frustration, that was not present in **CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the doctrine of frustration automatically discharges the contract due to an unforeseen event that makes performance impossible, without attributing fault to either party. Due to the doctrine of frustration, applying the same outcome (awarding reliance losses) in our case would have more negative consequences, such as unfairly burdening the Yorkshire Dales Railway with costs arising from an event beyond their control, unlike in **CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司**, where the Defendant's explicit breach justified the award of reliance losses.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司** should be stated as "When both [i*] (claimant incurring expenditures in reliance on a contract that becomes impossible to perform due to unforeseen events) and [m] (explicit breach of contract by the defendant) are present, the court should decide [o] (the claimant is entitled to recover those expenditures as reliance losses)." Omitting [m] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q] (unfairly burdening a party with costs arising from an event beyond their control, where no fault is attributable to them). Indeed, the opinion in **CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司** explicitly states that the Defendant's explicit breach was crucial to their decision to award reliance losses.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司** was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of a party being left worse off due to reliance on a contract that becomes impossible to perform due to the other party's explicit breach. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer was due to an unforeseen explosion, and no fault is attributable to any party. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the explicit breach of contract by the defendant, which was present in the precedent case **CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of a claimant incurring expenditures in reliance on a contract that becomes impossible to perform due to unforeseen events would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would unfairly prevent claimants from recovering their reliance losses in situations where the contract is frustrated by unforeseen events beyond the control of either party. Conversely, not requiring an explicit breach would allow for a more equitable outcome, ensuring that parties who have reasonably relied on a contract are not left worse off due to events outside their control. This better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and the equitable distribution of losses in contract law.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the explicit breach of contract by the defendant, which was present in **CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司**, we have the additional factor of the doctrine of frustration. This doctrine, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of a claimant incurring expenditures in reliance on a contract that becomes impossible to perform due to unforeseen events, serves a similar function to the explicit breach in the precedent case. Given the presence of the doctrine of frustration, we submit that the reasoning in **CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司** still applies, as the positive effects on fairness and equitable distribution of losses would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations:

**Key Similarities:**
1. **Reliance Loss:** Both cases involve claimants who incurred expenditures in reliance on a contract that became impossible to perform due to unforeseen events.
2. **Doctrine of Frustration:** Both cases deal with situations where the performance of the contract became impossible due to unforeseen events, invoking the doctrine of frustration.

**Key Differences:**
1. **Explicit Breach:** In the precedent case, there was an explicit breach of contract by the defendant, whereas in the current case, the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer was due to an unforeseen explosion with no fault attributable to any party.
2. **Nature of the Event:** The precedent case involved a voluntary withdrawal by the defendant, while the current case involves an accidental destruction of the subject matter of the contract.

**Proposed Legal Rule:**
The rule from the precedent case suggests that when a claimant incurs expenditures in reliance on a contract that becomes impossible to perform due to unforeseen events, the court should decide that the claimant is entitled to recover those expenditures as reliance losses, provided there is an explicit breach by the defendant.

**Merits and Flaws of Arguments:**
- **Merits of Initial Analogy:** The initial analogy correctly identifies the shared legal concepts and fact patterns, particularly the reliance loss and the doctrine of frustration.
- **Flaws of Initial Analogy:** The initial analogy overlooks the significance of the explicit breach in the precedent case, which was a crucial factor in the court's decision to award reliance losses.
- **Merits of Rebuttal Arguments:** The rebuttal arguments correctly highlight the absence of an explicit breach in the current case and the presence of the doctrine of frustration, which automatically discharges the contract without attributing fault.
- **Flaws of Rebuttal Arguments:** The rebuttal arguments may overemphasize the need for an explicit breach, potentially overlooking the broader principles of fairness and equitable distribution of losses.

**Final Decision:**
Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, equitable distribution of losses, and the doctrine of frustration, we conclude that Luke should be entitled to recover the £5,000 spent on the Hamilton Flyer as reliance losses. The key factors influencing this decision are:

1. **Doctrine of Frustration:** The unforeseen explosion that destroyed the Hamilton Flyer invokes the doctrine of frustration, which discharges the contract and allows for the recovery of reliance losses.
2. **Fairness and Equitable Distribution:** Allowing Luke to recover his reliance losses ensures that he is not left worse off due to an event beyond his control, aligning with the principles of fairness and equitable distribution of losses.
3. **Consistency in Legal Outcomes:** Applying the same legal principles to similar fact patterns promotes consistency and predictability in the law, even in the absence of an explicit breach.

Therefore, the court should find that the doctrine of frustration discharges Luke's contract with the Yorkshire Dales Railway and that he is entitled to recover the £5,000 spent on the Hamilton Flyer. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR")

In the case of WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" [2022] HKCFI 2036; HCA 954/2020 (precedent p), the defendants (tenants) argued that the plaintiff's (landlord's) actions constituted a breach of the quiet enjoyment covenant and that the contract was frustrated due to extraordinary and unprecedented events, namely social unrest and the COVID-19 pandemic. The court ruled that the doctrine of frustration did not apply because the events did not render the performance of the contract radically different from what was originally contemplated. The court emphasized that the risk of economic downturn or adverse market conditions generally falls on the tenant, and the contract's obligations were not transformed into something radically different.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Doctrine of Frustration**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In both cases, extraordinary and unforeseen events occurred that significantly impacted the parties' ability to perform their contractual obligations. In WHARF REALTY, it was social unrest and the pandemic; in the current case, it is the explosion that destroyed the Hamilton Flyer.

- **Legal Concept 2: Risk Allocation**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** The contracts in both cases were silent on the issue of risk and damage. In WHARF REALTY, the court noted that the risk of economic downturn generally falls on the tenant. In the current case, the contract does not specify who bears the risk of the train's destruction.

- **Legal Concept 3: Performance of Contractual Obligations**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In both cases, the parties were unable to perform their contractual obligations as originally intended. In WHARF REALTY, the tenants could not operate their business as expected; in the current case, Luke cannot complete the restoration work, and Peter cannot experience the Hamilton Flyer as planned.

- **Legal Concept 4: Commercial Expectations**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** Both cases involve commercial expectations that were not met due to unforeseen events. In WHARF REALTY, the expectation was a regular influx of tourists; in the current case, the expectation was the completion and operation of the Hamilton Flyer.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR")

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of extraordinary and unforeseen events impacting the performance of contractual obligations, the court should decide that the doctrine of frustration does not apply if the fundamental nature of the contract has not been radically altered. This rule was justified in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" because the positive effects (E+) of maintaining contractual stability and upholding the original risk allocation outweighed the negative effects (E-) of the unforeseen events on the parties' commercial expectations.

Applying this rule to the current case:

- **Luke's Contract:** The destruction of the Hamilton Flyer does not radically alter the nature of Luke's contractual obligation to restore the train. The risk of the train's destruction, although unforeseen, does not shift the fundamental nature of the contract. Therefore, the doctrine of frustration would not discharge Luke's contract, and he would not be entitled to any portion of the £8,000 payment that was due upon completion.

- **Peter's Contract:** The replacement of the Hamilton Flyer with the Selby Miner does not radically alter the nature of Peter's contract to book seats for a celebratory trip. Although the specific train has changed, the fundamental nature of the service (a train ride) remains the same. Therefore, the doctrine of frustration would not discharge Peter's contract, and he would not be entitled to recover the £100 paid for the tickets.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR") are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Doctrine of Frustration**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In both cases, extraordinary and unforeseen events occurred that significantly impacted the parties' ability to perform their contractual obligations. In WHARF REALTY, it was social unrest and the pandemic; in the current case, it is the explosion that destroyed the Hamilton Flyer.

- **Legal Concept 2: Risk Allocation**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** The contracts in both cases were silent on the issue of risk and damage. In WHARF REALTY, the court noted that the risk of economic downturn generally falls on the tenant. In the current case, the contract does not specify who bears the risk of the train's destruction.

- **Legal Concept 3: Performance of Contractual Obligations**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In both cases, the parties were unable to perform their contractual obligations as originally intended. In WHARF REALTY, the tenants could not operate their business as expected; in the current case, Luke cannot complete the restoration work, and Peter cannot experience the Hamilton Flyer as planned.

- **Legal Concept 4: Commercial Expectations**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** Both cases involve commercial expectations that were not met due to unforeseen events. In WHARF REALTY, the expectation was a regular influx of tourists; in the current case, the expectation was the completion and operation of the Hamilton Flyer.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR." This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Maintaining Contractual Stability:** Upholding the original terms of the contract despite unforeseen events ensures that parties can rely on the stability and predictability of their contractual agreements. This is crucial for commercial certainty and the smooth functioning of business transactions.

2. **Upholding Risk Allocation:** By not invoking the doctrine of frustration, the court respects the implicit risk allocation agreed upon by the parties. In the current case, this means that Luke, as the restorer, bears the risk of the train's destruction, and Peter, as the customer, bears the risk of changes in the service provided.

3. **Encouraging Comprehensive Contract Drafting:** This outcome encourages parties to explicitly address potential risks and contingencies in their contracts. This proactive approach can lead to more thorough and well-considered agreements, reducing the likelihood of disputes.

4. **Preventing Unjust Enrichment:** Allowing Luke to claim a portion of the £8,000 payment or Peter to recover the £100 paid for tickets would result in an unfair advantage, as the fundamental nature of their contractual obligations has not been radically altered. The parties should not be unjustly enriched due to unforeseen events.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR," it would maintain contractual stability, uphold risk allocation, encourage comprehensive contract drafting, and prevent unjust enrichment.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR," the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the tenants' primary obligation was to pay rent and operate their business, and the risk of economic downturn or adverse market conditions generally falls on the tenant. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—maintaining contractual stability and upholding the original risk allocation—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it reinforced the principle that commercial expectations, even if unmet, do not fundamentally alter the nature of the contractual obligations.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as Luke's primary obligation was to restore the Hamilton Flyer, and the explosion that destroyed the train was an unforeseen event that made the completion of his work impossible. Unlike the tenants in WHARF REALTY, Luke's ability to perform his contractual obligation was entirely dependent on the existence of the train, which was destroyed through no fault of his own. Therefore, the risk allocation principle that applied in WHARF REALTY does not directly translate to Luke's situation.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR." This factor is the complete destruction of the subject matter of the contract (the Hamilton Flyer) due to an unforeseen explosion. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it directly impacts the ability to perform the contractual obligations.

Due to the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as unjustly holding Luke to a contract that he cannot possibly fulfill and denying him any compensation for the work already completed. Unlike in WHARF REALTY, where the tenants could still operate their business albeit under more challenging conditions, Luke's situation involves an absolute impossibility of performance. Therefore, the presence of this factor suggests that the doctrine of frustration should apply to discharge Luke's contract, allowing him to recover the £5,000 spent on the restoration work. Similarly, Peter's contract should be considered frustrated as the specific experience he contracted for (a ride on the Hamilton Flyer) is no longer possible, justifying the recovery of the £100 paid for the tickets.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" should be stated as 'When both [extraordinary and unforeseen events impacting the performance of contractual obligations] and [the complete destruction of the subject matter of the contract] are present, the court should decide [that the doctrine of frustration applies to discharge the contract].' Omitting [the complete destruction of the subject matter of the contract] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of unjustly holding a party to a contract that they cannot possibly fulfill and denying them any compensation for work already completed]. Indeed, the opinion in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" explicitly states that the risk of economic downturn generally falls on the tenant, which was crucial to their decision. However, this principle does not directly translate to a situation where the subject matter of the contract is completely destroyed, making performance impossible.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of tenants avoiding their contractual obligations due to economic downturns or adverse market conditions, which are risks generally borne by the tenant. However, in our current case, there's no risk of tenants or contractors avoiding their obligations due to economic downturns. Instead, the issue is the complete destruction of the subject matter of the contract, which makes performance impossible. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The doctrine of frustration should apply to discharge Luke's contract, allowing him to recover the £5,000 spent on the restoration work, and Peter's contract should be considered frustrated, justifying the recovery of the £100 paid for the tickets.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of "economic downturn or adverse market conditions" (factor m), which was present in the precedent case WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR," requiring this factor for all similar cases of "extraordinary and unforeseen events impacting the performance of contractual obligations" (fact pattern i*) would lead to the undesirable consequence of unjustly holding parties to contracts that they cannot possibly fulfill due to the complete destruction of the subject matter. Conversely, not requiring the factor of "economic downturn or adverse market conditions" would allow for a more just outcome, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, such as fairness and the prevention of unjust enrichment. This approach ensures that parties are not unfairly penalized for events entirely beyond their control, which fundamentally alter the nature of their contractual obligations.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of "economic downturn or adverse market conditions" (factor m), which was present in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR," we have the additional factor of "complete destruction of the subject matter of the contract" (factor n). This factor n, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of "extraordinary and unforeseen events impacting the performance of contractual obligations" (fact pattern i*), serves a similar function to factor m in the precedent case. Given the presence of factor n, we submit that the reasoning in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as fairness and the prevention of unjust enrichment, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. This ensures that parties are not unfairly held to contracts that have become impossible to perform due to unforeseen and extraordinary events.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR," the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of extraordinary and unforeseen events impacting the performance of contractual obligations and the silence of the contract on the issue of risk and damage. However, it also differs significantly in that the current case involves the complete destruction of the subject matter of the contract (the Hamilton Flyer), which was not a factor in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case—that the doctrine of frustration does not apply if the fundamental nature of the contract has not been radically altered—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the complete destruction of the subject matter in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point from the initial analogy that maintaining contractual stability and upholding the original risk allocation are crucial for commercial certainty. On the other hand, the rebuttal argument highlights that the complete destruction of the subject matter makes performance impossible, which fundamentally alters the nature of the contractual obligations.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, the prevention of unjust enrichment, and the doctrine of frustration, we conclude that the doctrine of frustration should apply to discharge the contracts in the current case. This decision is justified because the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer makes it impossible for Luke to complete his restoration work and for Peter to experience the specific train ride he contracted for. Therefore, Luke should be entitled to recover the £5,000 spent on the restoration work, and Peter should be entitled to recover the £100 paid for the tickets.

This conclusion aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by ensuring that parties are not unfairly held to contracts that have become impossible to perform due to unforeseen and extraordinary events. The key factors influencing this outcome are the complete destruction of the subject matter and the impossibility of performance, which fundamentally alter the nature of the contractual obligations.

   - A contract to which sections 16 and 18 apply contains any provision which, upon the true construction of the contract, is intended to have effect in the event of circumstances arising which operate, or would but for the said provision operate, to frustrate the contract, or is intended to have effect whether such circumstances arise or not.

   Consequences:
   - The court shall give effect to the said provision and shall only give effect to section 16 to such extent, if any, as appears to the court to be consistent with the said provision.

   Exceptions:
   - None.

### Minor Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 1 and 2:
   - Luke's contract to restore the Hamilton Flyer has become impossible of performance due to the train's destruction.
   - The parties (Luke and Yorkshire Dales Railway) have been discharged from further performance of the contract.
   - Luke has spent £5,000 working on the train prior to its destruction.
   - Luke was due to be paid £8,000 on completion of the work.
   - The £5,000 spent by Luke can be considered as expenses incurred before the time of discharge.
   - The court may allow Luke to recover the £5,000 spent, but not more than that amount.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3:
   - Peter has paid £100 for tickets on the Hamilton Flyer.
   - The contract for the tickets has become impossible of performance due to the train's destruction.
   - Peter has not obtained any valuable benefit from the performance of the contract before the time of discharge.
   - Therefore, Peter is entitled to recover the £100 paid for the tickets.

3. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 17 Subsection 3:
   - The contract does not contain any provision intended to have effect in the event of circumstances arising which operate to frustrate the contract.
   - Therefore, Section 17 Subsection 3 does not apply.

### Conclusion:

The doctrine of frustration applies to discharge both Luke's and Peter's contracts with the Yorkshire Dales Railway. Luke can recover the £5,000 he spent on the restoration work, but he cannot claim the £8,000 that was due upon completion. Peter can recover the £100 he paid for the tickets.

### Major Premise:

1. National Carriers Ltd v Panalpina (Northern) Limited [1981] AC 675

   Conditions:
   - There supervenes an event (without default of either party and for which the contract makes no sufficient provision) which so significantly changes the nature (not merely the expense or onerousness) of the outstanding contractual rights and/or obligations from what the parties could reasonably have contemplated at the time of its execution.
   - It would be unjust to hold them to the literal sense of its stipulations in the new circumstances.

   Consequences:
   - The law declares both parties to be discharged from the further performance.

   Exceptions:
   - The interruption is expected to last for the unexpired term of the lease, or at least for a long period of that unexpired term.

   - The contract is not wide enough to apply to the new situation.

   Consequences:
   - The law declares both parties to be discharged from further performance.

   Exceptions:
   - The contract is wide enough to apply to the new situation.

### Minor Premise:

1. National Carriers Ltd v Panalpina (Northern) Limited [1981] AC 675:
- There supervened an event (the explosion) without default of either party and for which the contract makes no sufficient provision.
- The explosion significantly changed the nature of the outstanding contractual rights and/or obligations from what the parties could reasonably have contemplated at the time of its execution.
- It would be unjust to hold Luke and Peter to the literal sense of the contract in the new circumstances.
- The interruption (destruction of the Hamilton Flyer) is not expected to last for the unexpired term of the lease, as the train is completely destroyed.

2. WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A 'ARMANI JUNIOR' [2022] HKCFI 2036; HCA 954/2020 (15 July 2022):

- The explosion significantly changed the nature of the outstanding contractual rights and/or obligations from what the parties could reasonably have contemplated at the time of its execution that it would be unjust to hold them to the literal sense of its stipulations in the new circumstances.
- The contract is not wide enough to apply to the new situation (the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer).

### Conclusion:

The doctrine of frustration applies to discharge both Luke's and Peter's contracts with the Yorkshire Dales Railway. Luke and Peter are discharged from further performance of their contracts. Luke may recover the £5,000 he spent working on the train, and Peter may recover the £100 he paid for the tickets.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (SILVERCORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD)

In the case of SILVERCORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD [2022] HKCFI 362; [2022] 1 HKLRD 975 ; HCA 268/2021 (precedent p), the court ruled that the doctrine of frustration did not apply to discharge the tenancy agreements between the parties. The court found that the common purpose of the tenancy agreements was not frustrated by the Social Unrest and the COVID-19 Pandemic, as the premises could still be used for their intended purpose, albeit not commercially viable. The court emphasized that commercial viability is not sufficient to cause frustration.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in SILVERCORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Doctrine of Frustration**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In both cases, an unforeseen event (explosion in the current case, Social Unrest and Pandemic in the precedent) occurred that significantly impacted the performance of the contract.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Common Purpose**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** In both cases, the parties had a specific common purpose for entering into the contract (restoration of the Hamilton Flyer for tourist trips in the current case, operation of luxury watch retail stores in the precedent).
  
- **Legal Concept 3: Risk Allocation**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In both cases, the contracts were silent on the issue of risk and damage, leading to a need to determine where the risk of unforeseen events should be allocated.
  
- **Legal Concept 4: Commercial Viability**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** In both cases, the argument was made that the unforeseen event rendered the performance of the contract commercially unviable (Luke's restoration work and Peter's booking for a specific experience).

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (SILVERCORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of an unforeseen event impacting the performance of a contract, the court should decide that the doctrine of frustration does not apply if the common purpose of the contract can still be fulfilled, even if it is not commercially viable. This rule was justified in SILVERCORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD because the positive effects (E+) of maintaining contractual certainty and risk allocation outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potential commercial unviability.

Applying this rule to the current case:

- **Luke's Contract:** The common purpose of Luke's contract was to restore the Hamilton Flyer. Although the train was destroyed, the contract did not specify risk allocation for such an event. Following the precedent, the doctrine of frustration would not discharge Luke's contract, and he may not recover the £5,000 spent, nor the £8,000 due on completion, as the risk of the unforeseen event rests with him.

- **Peter's Contract:** The common purpose of Peter's contract was to book seats on the Hamilton Flyer for a specific experience. Although the Hamilton Flyer was destroyed, the Yorkshire Dales Railway can still provide a similar service with the Selby Miner. Following the precedent, the doctrine of frustration would not discharge Peter's contract, and he may not recover the £100 paid, as the risk of the unforeseen event rests with him, and the railway can still fulfill the general purpose of the contract.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (SILVERCORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Doctrine of Frustration**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** An unforeseen event (explosion in the current case, Social Unrest and Pandemic in the precedent) occurred that significantly impacted the performance of the contract.

- **Legal Concept 2: Common Purpose**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** The parties had a specific common purpose for entering into the contract (restoration of the Hamilton Flyer for tourist trips in the current case, operation of luxury watch retail stores in the precedent).

- **Legal Concept 3: Risk Allocation**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** The contracts were silent on the issue of risk and damage, leading to a need to determine where the risk of unforeseen events should be allocated.

- **Legal Concept 4: Commercial Viability**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** The argument was made that the unforeseen event rendered the performance of the contract commercially unviable (Luke's restoration work and Peter's booking for a specific experience).

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in SILVERCORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Maintaining Contractual Certainty:** Upholding the contracts despite the unforeseen events ensures that parties can rely on the terms they agreed to, promoting stability and predictability in commercial transactions.

2. **Proper Risk Allocation:** By placing the risk of unforeseen events on the party best positioned to manage it (in this case, the tenant or contractor), the court reinforces the principle that parties should bear the risks inherent in their business decisions.

3. **Encouraging Diligence in Contract Drafting:** This outcome incentivizes parties to explicitly address risk allocation in their contracts, leading to more comprehensive and clear agreements.

4. **Avoiding Unjust Enrichment:** Allowing the contracts to be discharged due to frustration could result in one party being unjustly enriched at the expense of the other, particularly if they have already received some benefit from the contract.

Therefore, applying the rule from the precedent case, the court should find that the doctrine of frustration does not discharge Luke's and Peter's contracts with the Yorkshire Dales Railway. Luke may not recover the £5,000 spent or the £8,000 due on completion, and Peter may not recover the £100 paid for the tickets, as the risk of the unforeseen event rests with them, and the railway can still fulfill the general purpose of the contracts.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **SILVERCORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the premises could still be used for their intended purpose, even if not commercially viable. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—maintaining contractual certainty and proper risk allocation—outweighed any potential drawbacks, such as the tenant's commercial unviability. However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as the Hamilton Flyer was completely destroyed in an explosion, making it impossible for Luke to complete the restoration work and for Peter to experience the specific trip he had booked.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—the complete destruction of the subject matter of the contract (the Hamilton Flyer)—that was not present in **SILVERCORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of unforeseen events impacting the performance of a contract. Because of the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as unjustly holding Luke and Peter to contracts that can no longer be performed, than positive ones, unlike in **SILVERCORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD**. The destruction of the Hamilton Flyer fundamentally changes the nature of the contractual obligations, making it impossible to fulfill the common purpose of the contracts.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from **SILVERCORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD** should be stated as: "When both [the fact pattern of an unforeseen event impacting the performance of a contract] and [the ability to still fulfill the common purpose of the contract, albeit not commercially viable] are present, the court should decide [that the doctrine of frustration does not apply]." Omitting [the ability to still fulfill the common purpose of the contract] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of unjustly holding parties to contracts that can no longer be performed due to the complete destruction of the subject matter]. Indeed, the opinion in **SILVERCORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD** explicitly states that [the premises could still be used for their intended purpose, even if not commercially viable, was crucial to their decision].

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in **SILVERCORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties escaping their contractual obligations merely due to commercial unviability]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [parties escaping their contractual obligations merely due to commercial unviability] because the Hamilton Flyer was completely destroyed, making it impossible to fulfill the common purpose of the contracts. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the ability to still fulfill the common purpose of the contract, which was present in the precedent case **SILVERCORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of unforeseen events impacting the performance of a contract would lead to the undesirable consequence of unjustly holding parties to contracts that can no longer be performed due to the complete destruction of the subject matter. Conversely, not requiring the ability to still fulfill the common purpose of the contract would allow for a more equitable outcome, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, such as fairness and the prevention of unjust enrichment.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the ability to still fulfill the common purpose of the contract, which was present in **SILVERCORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD**, we have the additional factor of the complete destruction of the subject matter of the contract (the Hamilton Flyer). This complete destruction, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of an unforeseen event impacting the performance of a contract, serves a similar function to the ability to still fulfill the common purpose in the precedent case. Given the presence of the complete destruction of the subject matter, we submit that the reasoning in **SILVERCORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD** still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as fairness and the prevention of unjust enrichment would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **SILVERCORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the unforeseen event impacting the performance of a contract and the silence of the contract on risk allocation. However, it also differs significantly in that the subject matter of the contract (the Hamilton Flyer) was completely destroyed, making it impossible to fulfill the common purpose of the contracts.

The proposed legal rule from **SILVERCORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD**—that the doctrine of frustration does not apply if the common purpose of the contract can still be fulfilled, even if not commercially viable—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the complete destruction of the subject matter in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point from the precedent that maintaining contractual certainty and proper risk allocation is crucial, and the strong point from the current case that the complete destruction of the subject matter fundamentally changes the nature of the contractual obligations.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, prevention of unjust enrichment, and the need for contractual certainty, we conclude that the doctrine of frustration should apply in the current case due to the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer. This destruction makes it impossible to fulfill the common purpose of the contracts, distinguishing it from the precedent where the premises could still be used for their intended purpose.

Therefore, Luke's contract with the Yorkshire Dales Railway should be discharged under the doctrine of frustration, allowing him to recover the £5,000 spent on the restoration work. Similarly, Peter's contract should also be discharged, allowing him to recover the £100 paid for the tickets, as the specific experience he booked can no longer be provided.

This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency, taking into account the unique circumstances of the complete destruction of the subject matter.


# Contract Law: Whether Peter can recover the £100 he paid in advance for the tickets under the doctrine of frustration

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2 and 3

### Major Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - A contract governed by law applicable to the Colony has become impossible of performance or been otherwise frustrated.
   - The parties thereto have for that reason been discharged from the further performance of the contract.

   Consequences:
   - All sums paid or payable to any party in pursuance of the contract before the time of discharge shall, in the case of sums so paid, be recoverable from him as money received by him for the use of the party by whom the sums were paid.
   - In the case of sums so payable, cease to be so payable.

   Exceptions:
   - The party to whom the sums were so paid or payable incurred expenses before the time of discharge in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, the court may, if it considers it just to do so having regard to all the circumstances of the case, allow him to retain or recover the whole or any part of the sums so paid or payable, not being an amount in excess of the expenses so incurred.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3

   Conditions:
   - Any party to the contract has, by reason of anything done by any other party thereto in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, obtained a valuable benefit (other than a payment of money to which subsection (2) applies) before the time of discharge.

   Consequences:
   - There shall be recoverable from him by the said other party such sum (if any), not exceeding the value of the said benefit to the party obtaining it, as the court considers just, having regard to all the circumstances of the case.

### Minor Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2:
- Peter entered into a contract with the Yorkshire Dales Railway for tickets on the Hamilton Flyer.
- The contract has become impossible of performance due to the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer.
- The parties have been discharged from further performance of the contract.
- Peter paid £100 in advance for the tickets.
- Therefore, Peter can recover the £100 paid as money received by the Yorkshire Dales Railway for his use.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3:
- Peter has not obtained any valuable benefit from the Yorkshire Dales Railway before the time of discharge.
- Therefore, this section does not apply to Peter's case.

### Conclusion:

Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2 applies, and Peter can recover the £100 he paid in advance for the tickets under the doctrine of frustration.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD)

In the case of VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD [2022] HKCFI 279; HCA 1114/2020 (precedent p), the defendant argued that extraordinary circumstances (social unrest and the COVID-19 pandemic) frustrated the contract and sought abatement of rent. The court ruled that the defendant failed to show an arguable defence for abatement of rent based on the provision and that the extraordinary circumstances did not render the premises unfit for use or inaccessible. The court also found that the doctrine of frustration did not apply as the obligations were not "radically different" from those originally undertaken.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Doctrine of Frustration**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the parties argue that extraordinary circumstances (social unrest and pandemic in precedent p; explosion in current case c) have frustrated the contract.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Radical Change in Obligations**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In both cases, the argument hinges on whether the obligations under the contract have become "radically different" due to the supervening event.

- **Legal Concept 3: Commercial Purpose**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In both cases, the parties argue that the commercial purpose of the contract has been frustrated (luxury retail store operation in precedent p; tourist trips on the Hamilton Flyer in current case c).

- **Legal Concept 4: Recovery of Monies Paid**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In both cases, there is a question of whether monies paid in advance can be recovered if the contract is found to be frustrated.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a supervening event causing a significant change in the commercial purpose or obligations under the contract, the court should decide whether the doctrine of frustration applies. This rule was justified in VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD because the court found that the obligations were not "radically different" and that the mere incidence of expense or delay was not sufficient to invoke the doctrine of frustration. The positive effects (E+) of this outcome include maintaining contractual certainty and upholding the principle that contracts should not be lightly set aside. The negative effects (E-) are outweighed by the need to ensure that parties cannot easily escape their contractual obligations due to unforeseen but manageable changes in circumstances.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case involving Luke and Peter, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Doctrine of Frustration**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the parties argue that extraordinary circumstances (social unrest and pandemic in precedent; explosion in current case) have frustrated the contract.

- **Legal Concept 2: Radical Change in Obligations**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In both cases, the argument hinges on whether the obligations under the contract have become "radically different" due to the supervening event.

- **Legal Concept 3: Commercial Purpose**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In both cases, the parties argue that the commercial purpose of the contract has been frustrated (luxury retail store operation in precedent; tourist trips on the Hamilton Flyer in current case).

- **Legal Concept 4: Recovery of Monies Paid**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In both cases, there is a question of whether monies paid in advance can be recovered if the contract is found to be frustrated.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Maintaining Contractual Certainty**: Upholding the principle that contracts should not be lightly set aside ensures that parties can rely on the terms they have agreed upon, promoting stability and predictability in commercial transactions.

2. **Preventing Easy Escape from Obligations**: Ensuring that the doctrine of frustration is not easily invoked prevents parties from using unforeseen but manageable changes in circumstances as an excuse to escape their contractual obligations. This promotes fairness and discourages opportunistic behavior.

3. **Encouraging Proper Risk Allocation**: By not allowing the doctrine of frustration to be easily applied, parties are encouraged to properly allocate risks in their contracts, leading to more thorough and considered contractual arrangements.

4. **Consistency in Legal Application**: Applying the same legal principles consistently across similar cases ensures that the law is applied uniformly, which is a cornerstone of the common law system.

In the case of Luke, the explosion has destroyed the Hamilton Flyer, making it impossible for him to complete the restoration work. However, the doctrine of frustration would not apply because the contract's obligations have not become "radically different"; rather, the subject matter of the contract (the Hamilton Flyer) no longer exists. Luke may seek recovery of his expenses under the principle of restitution for unjust enrichment, but not under the doctrine of frustration.

For Peter, the Hamilton Flyer no longer exists, and the specific purpose of his contract (to celebrate his father's 90th birthday on the Hamilton Flyer) cannot be fulfilled. This situation is more akin to the frustration of purpose seen in Krell v Henry, where the foundation of the contract (the coronation procession) was destroyed. Therefore, Peter may have a stronger argument for the application of the doctrine of frustration, allowing him to recover the £100 paid for the tickets.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would maintain contractual certainty, prevent easy escape from obligations, encourage proper risk allocation, and ensure consistency in legal application.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the premises were still accessible and usable, albeit under more onerous conditions. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—maintaining contractual certainty and preventing easy escape from obligations—outweighed any potential drawbacks because the premises were not rendered completely unfit for use or inaccessible. However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as the Hamilton Flyer has been completely destroyed in an explosion, making it impossible for Luke to complete his restoration work and for Peter to celebrate his father's 90th birthday on the train.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—the complete destruction of the subject matter of the contract (the Hamilton Flyer)—that was not present in **VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer makes the performance of the contract impossible, rather than merely more onerous or less profitable. Due to this complete destruction, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as unfairly holding parties to a contract that cannot be performed, than positive ones, unlike in **VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD**. This is because the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer fundamentally changes the nature of the obligations under the contract, making them "radically different" from those originally undertaken.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD** should be stated as "When both [the fact pattern of a supervening event causing a significant change in the commercial purpose or obligations under the contract] and [the subject matter of the contract remains accessible and usable] are present, the court should decide [that the doctrine of frustration does not apply]." Omitting [the subject matter of the contract remains accessible and usable] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of unfairly holding parties to a contract that cannot be performed due to the complete destruction of the subject matter]. Indeed, the opinion in **VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD** explicitly states that the premises were still accessible and usable, albeit under more onerous conditions, which was crucial to their decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties easily escaping their contractual obligations due to unforeseen but manageable changes in circumstances]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [parties escaping their obligations due to manageable changes] occurring because the Hamilton Flyer has been completely destroyed, making the performance of the contract impossible. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of the subject matter remaining accessible and usable, which was present in the precedent case VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD, requiring this factor for all similar cases of a supervening event causing a significant change in the commercial purpose or obligations under the contract would lead to the undesirable consequence of unfairly holding parties to contracts that have become impossible to perform due to the complete destruction of the subject matter. Conversely, not requiring the subject matter to remain accessible and usable would allow for a more just outcome, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, such as fairness and the prevention of unjust enrichment.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of the subject matter remaining accessible and usable, which was present in VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD, we have the additional factor of the complete destruction of the subject matter (the Hamilton Flyer). This complete destruction, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of a supervening event causing a significant change in the commercial purpose or obligations under the contract, serves a similar function to the subject matter remaining accessible and usable in the precedent case. Given the presence of the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer, we submit that the reasoning in VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as fairness and the prevention of unjust enrichment, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the invocation of the doctrine of frustration due to extraordinary circumstances and the argument that the commercial purpose of the contract has been frustrated. However, it also differs significantly in that the subject matter of the contract (the Hamilton Flyer) has been completely destroyed, making performance impossible.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case, which suggests that the doctrine of frustration does not apply when the subject matter remains accessible and usable, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in scenarios where the subject matter is completely destroyed.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point from the initial analogy that maintaining contractual certainty and preventing easy escape from obligations are crucial, and the strong point from the rebuttal that the complete destruction of the subject matter fundamentally changes the nature of the obligations under the contract, making them "radically different."

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, the prevention of unjust enrichment, and the need for consistency in legal application, we conclude that the doctrine of frustration should apply in the case of Peter but not in the case of Luke.

For **Peter**, the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer means that the specific purpose of his contract (to celebrate his father's 90th birthday on the Hamilton Flyer) cannot be fulfilled. This situation is more akin to the frustration of purpose seen in **Krell v Henry**, where the foundation of the contract was destroyed. Therefore, Peter should be able to recover the £100 paid for the tickets under the doctrine of frustration.

For **Luke**, while the explosion has destroyed the Hamilton Flyer, making it impossible for him to complete the restoration work, the doctrine of frustration would not apply because the contract's obligations have not become "radically different"; rather, the subject matter of the contract no longer exists. Luke may seek recovery of his expenses under the principle of restitution for unjust enrichment, but not under the doctrine of frustration.

In conclusion, the decision reached aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency. The key factors influencing this outcome include the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer and the specific purposes of the contracts involved.


# Contract Law: Whether Peter can claim any additional compensation for the loss of the unique experience of riding in the driver's seat and reliving trips with his father

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsections 2, 3, 4, and 5

### Major Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - A contract governed by law applicable to the Colony has become impossible of performance or been otherwise frustrated.
   - The parties thereto have for that reason been discharged from the further performance of the contract.

   Consequences:
   - All sums paid or payable to any party in pursuance of the contract before the time of discharge shall, in the case of sums so paid, be recoverable from him as money received by him for the use of the party by whom the sums were paid.
   - In the case of sums so payable, cease to be so payable.

   Exceptions:
   - If the party to whom the sums were so paid or payable incurred expenses before the time of discharge in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, the court may, if it considers it just to do so having regard to all the circumstances of the case, allow him to retain or recover the whole or any part of the sums so paid or payable, not being an amount in excess of the expenses so incurred.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3

   Conditions:
   - Any party to the contract has, by reason of anything done by any other party thereto in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, obtained a valuable benefit (other than a payment of money to which subsection (2) applies) before the time of discharge.

   Conditions:
   - In estimating the amount of any expenses incurred by any party to the contract.

   Consequences:
   - The court may, without prejudice to the generality of the said subsections, include such sum as appears to be reasonable in respect of overhead expenses and in respect of any work or services performed personally by the said party.

   Exceptions:
   - None.

### Minor Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2:
- The contract between Luke and the Yorkshire Dales Railway has become impossible of performance due to the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer.
- The parties have been discharged from further performance of the contract.
- Luke has spent £5,000 working on the train prior to its destruction.
- Luke was due to be paid £8,000 on completion of the work.
- Luke can recover the £5,000 spent as money received by the Yorkshire Dales Railway for his use.
- The £8,000 payable to Luke ceases to be payable.
- The court may allow Luke to retain or recover the whole or any part of the sums paid or payable, not exceeding the expenses incurred (£5,000).

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3:
- Peter has paid £100 for tickets on the Hamilton Flyer.
- The contract has become impossible of performance due to the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer.

The doctrine of frustration would discharge the contracts between Luke and the Yorkshire Dales Railway, and between Peter and the Yorkshire Dales Railway. Luke can recover the £5,000 he spent on the train, and the £8,000 payable to him ceases to be payable. Peter can recover the £100 he paid for the tickets. Peter cannot claim any additional compensation for the loss of the unique experience of riding in the driver's seat and reliving trips with his father.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD)

In the case of VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD [2022] HKCFI 279; HCA 1114/2020 (precedent p), the court ruled that the defendant (tenant) failed to show an arguable defence for abatement of rent based on the provision of extraordinary circumstances. The court held that the extraordinary circumstances did not render the premises unfit for use or inaccessible, and thus, the doctrine of frustration did not apply to discharge the contract.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Doctrine of Frustration**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the parties are seeking to discharge their contractual obligations due to extraordinary circumstances that were beyond their control.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Force Majeure and Contractual Obligations**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: Both cases involve the interpretation of whether the extraordinary circumstances fall within the scope of force majeure clauses or similar provisions in the contract.
  
- **Legal Concept 3: Impact on Contractual Performance**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In both cases, the extraordinary circumstances have impacted the ability of the parties to perform their contractual obligations, but the court examines whether this impact is sufficient to invoke the doctrine of frustration.
  
- **Legal Concept 4: Financial Impact vs. Physical Impossibility**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: Both cases involve a distinction between financial hardship or reduced profitability and the physical impossibility of performing the contract.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of extraordinary circumstances impacting contractual performance (fact pattern i*), the court should decide that the doctrine of frustration does not apply unless the circumstances render the performance physically or commercially impossible (outcome o). This rule was justified in VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD because the positive effects (E+) of maintaining contractual obligations despite extraordinary circumstances uphold the underlying values of contractual certainty and fairness, outweighing the negative effects (E-) of potential financial hardship on the parties. 

In the current case, applying this rule means that Luke and Peter's contracts with the Yorkshire Dales Railway would not be discharged under the doctrine of frustration. The destruction of the Hamilton Flyer, while unfortunate, does not render the performance of the contracts physically or commercially impossible, as the service can be replaced by the Selby Miner. Therefore, Luke and Peter would not be entitled to recover any monies paid or payable under the doctrine of frustration.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Doctrine of Frustration**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: Both cases involve parties seeking to discharge their contractual obligations due to extraordinary circumstances beyond their control. In the precedent, the tenant sought to abate rent due to extraordinary circumstances, while in the current case, Luke and Peter are seeking to discharge their contracts due to the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer.

- **Legal Concept 2: Force Majeure and Contractual Obligations**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: Both cases involve the interpretation of whether the extraordinary circumstances fall within the scope of force majeure clauses or similar provisions in the contract. In the precedent, the court examined whether the extraordinary circumstances triggered the force majeure clause. In the current case, the contract is silent on the issue of risk and damage, but the principle remains relevant.

- **Legal Concept 3: Impact on Contractual Performance**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In both cases, the extraordinary circumstances have impacted the ability of the parties to perform their contractual obligations. In the precedent, the court examined whether the circumstances rendered the premises unfit for use or inaccessible. In the current case, the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer impacts the ability to perform the specific service contracted for.

- **Legal Concept 4: Financial Impact vs. Physical Impossibility**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: Both cases involve a distinction between financial hardship or reduced profitability and the physical impossibility of performing the contract. In the precedent, the court found that the extraordinary circumstances did not render the performance physically or commercially impossible. In the current case, the service can be replaced by the Selby Miner, indicating that performance is not physically impossible.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Contractual Certainty**: Maintaining the contractual obligations despite the extraordinary circumstances upholds the principle of contractual certainty. Parties entering into contracts can rely on the terms agreed upon, knowing that they will not be easily discharged due to unforeseen events.

2. **Fairness and Equity**: The decision ensures fairness and equity by not allowing parties to escape their contractual obligations merely due to financial hardship or inconvenience. This prevents parties from using extraordinary circumstances as an excuse to avoid fulfilling their commitments.

3. **Encouraging Risk Management**: By not discharging the contracts under the doctrine of frustration, the decision encourages parties to include clear force majeure clauses and risk management provisions in their contracts. This promotes better planning and risk allocation in future agreements.

4. **Consistency in Legal Application**: Applying the same rule to similar fact patterns ensures consistency in legal application, which is a fundamental principle of common law. This consistency provides predictability and stability in contractual relationships.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD, it would uphold the underlying values of contractual certainty, fairness, and consistency in the application of the law.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of a **force majeure clause** in the contract. This clause was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as upholding contractual certainty and fairness, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided a clear framework for dealing with extraordinary circumstances. However, in our current case, this crucial **force majeure clause** is notably absent as the contract between Luke and the Yorkshire Dales Railway is silent on the issue of risk and damage. This absence means that there is no predefined mechanism to address the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer, which complicates the application of the same legal principles.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor **(the unique and personal nature of Peter's booking)** that was not present in **VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because Peter's booking was made to celebrate his father's 90th birthday and to relive trips made with his father, which is a unique and irreplaceable experience. Due to this personal and sentimental aspect, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as the loss of a once-in-a-lifetime experience, than positive ones, unlike in **VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD**. The precedent case dealt with commercial premises and financial implications, whereas our current case involves a unique personal experience that cannot be replicated by simply substituting the Hamilton Flyer with the Selby Miner. This distinction suggests that the doctrine of frustration might be more appropriately applied in Peter's case to acknowledge the unique nature of his booking and the irreplaceable loss he has suffered.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from **VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD** should be stated as "When both [i*] (extraordinary circumstances impacting contractual performance) and [m] (presence of a force majeure clause or similar provision) are present, the court should decide [o] (the doctrine of frustration does not apply unless the circumstances render the performance physically or commercially impossible)." Omitting [m] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q] (parties being unfairly bound to contracts without any predefined mechanism to address extraordinary circumstances, leading to potential injustice and unpredictability in contractual relationships). Indeed, the opinion in **VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD** explicitly states that the presence of a force majeure clause was crucial to their decision, as it provided a clear framework for dealing with extraordinary circumstances.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in **VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD** was clearly designed to prevent [undesirable consequence u] (parties escaping their contractual obligations merely due to financial hardship or inconvenience, thereby undermining contractual certainty and fairness). However, in our current case, there's no risk of [u] occurring because the unique and personal nature of Peter's booking involves an irreplaceable experience that cannot be mitigated by financial compensation or substitution with another service. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The absence of a force majeure clause and the unique personal nature of Peter's booking suggest that the doctrine of frustration might be more appropriately applied to acknowledge the irreplaceable loss he has suffered.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the presence of a force majeure clause, which was present in the precedent case **VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of extraordinary circumstances impacting contractual performance would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would mean that parties to contracts without such clauses would be unfairly bound to their obligations, even in situations where extraordinary circumstances make performance impossible or fundamentally different. Conversely, not requiring a force majeure clause would allow for a more equitable outcome, where the courts can consider the unique facts and circumstances of each case to determine whether the doctrine of frustration should apply. This approach better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and justice in contract law, ensuring that parties are not unduly penalized for unforeseen events beyond their control.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the presence of a force majeure clause, which was present in **VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD**, we have the additional factor of the unique and personal nature of Peter's booking. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of extraordinary events impacting contractual performance, serves a similar function to the force majeure clause in the precedent case. Given the presence of this unique and personal nature, we submit that the reasoning in **VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD** still applies, as the positive effects on fairness and justice would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. The unique and irreplaceable experience that Peter sought to relive with his father cannot be mitigated by financial compensation or substitution with another service, thus justifying the application of the doctrine of frustration in this instance.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **VEMBER LORD LTD v. THE SWATCH GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the impact of extraordinary circumstances on contractual performance and the examination of whether these circumstances render the performance physically or commercially impossible. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of a force majeure clause in the current case and the unique and personal nature of Peter's booking.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case, which states that the doctrine of frustration does not apply unless the circumstances render the performance physically or commercially impossible, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in situations where the contract lacks a force majeure clause and involves unique personal experiences.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the absence of a force majeure clause in the current case complicates the application of the same legal principles (Step 5) and the counterargument that the unique and irreplaceable nature of Peter's booking justifies the application of the doctrine of frustration (Step 8).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, justice, and contractual certainty, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the doctrine of frustration should apply to Peter's contract with the Yorkshire Dales Railway. The unique and irreplaceable experience that Peter sought to relive with his father cannot be mitigated by financial compensation or substitution with another service, thus justifying the application of the doctrine of frustration in this instance. 

For Luke, however, the absence of a force majeure clause and the fact that the service can be replaced by the Selby Miner indicate that the performance of his contract is not physically or commercially impossible. Therefore, the doctrine of frustration does not apply to Luke's contract, and he would not be entitled to recover any monies paid or payable under this doctrine.

### Final Decision

- **Peter's Contract**: The doctrine of frustration applies, discharging his contract with the Yorkshire Dales Railway. Peter should be entitled to recover the £100 paid for the tickets.
- **Luke's Contract**: The doctrine of frustration does not apply. Luke's contract remains in force, and he is not entitled to recover the £5,000 spent on the train's restoration.

### Relevant law:

Cheung Kit Lai v Rich Prosper Limited and WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A 'ARMANI JUNIOR' [2022] HKCFI 2036

### Major Premise:

1. Cheung Kit Lai v Rich Prosper Limited

   Conditions:
   - It appears from the nature of the contract and the surrounding circumstances that the parties have contracted on the basis that some fundamental thing or state of things will continue to exist, or that some particular person will continue to be available, or that some future event which forms the basis of the contract will take place.
   - Before breach, an event in relation to the matter stipulated above renders performance impossible or only possible in a very different way from that contemplated, but without default of either party.

   Consequences:
   - The doctrine of frustration operates to excuse from further performance of a contract.

   Exceptions:
   - The performance is merely rendered difficult or onerous.
   - The delay is not abnormal in its cause, effects, or expected duration.

2. WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A 'ARMANI JUNIOR' [2022] HKCFI 2036

   Conditions:
   - There supervenes an event (without default of either party and for which the contract makes no sufficient provision) which so significantly changes the nature (not merely the expense or onerousness) of the outstanding contractual rights and/or obligations from what the parties could reasonably have contemplated at the time of its execution.

   Consequences:
   - It would be unjust to hold them to the literal sense of its stipulations in the new circumstances.
   - The law declares both parties to be discharged from further performance.

   Exceptions:
   - The contract is wide enough to apply to the new situation.

### Minor Premise:

1. Cheung Kit Lai v Rich Prosper Limited:
- Luke has a contract to restore the Hamilton Flyer, a specific steam train.
- The Hamilton Flyer was destroyed in an explosion, rendering the performance of the contract impossible.
- The destruction was without default of either party.
- The contract is silent on the issue of risk and damage.
- The performance is not merely rendered difficult or onerous; it is impossible.
- The delay is not relevant as the train is completely destroyed.

2. WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A 'ARMANI JUNIOR' [2022] HKCFI 2036:
- Peter booked seats on the Hamilton Flyer to celebrate his father's 90th birthday.
- The Hamilton Flyer was destroyed in an explosion, and the service will be replaced by the Selby Miner, a different train.
- The destruction was without default of either party, and the contract makes no sufficient provision for such an event.
- The nature of the outstanding contractual rights and obligations has significantly changed, as the Selby Miner is not the same as the Hamilton Flyer.
- The contract is not wide enough to apply to the new situation, as Peter specifically booked the Hamilton Flyer for sentimental reasons.

### Conclusion:

1. For Luke:
The doctrine of frustration applies, discharging Luke from further performance of the contract. Luke can recover the £5,000 he spent on the restoration work under the principle of restitution, as the contract is frustrated.

2. For Peter:
The doctrine of frustration applies, discharging Peter from the contract with the Yorkshire Dales Railway. Peter can recover the £100 paid for the tickets, as the contract is frustrated and the performance (a trip on the Hamilton Flyer) is no longer possible.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD)
In the case of SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD (precedent p), the court ruled that the tenant's claim of frustration due to the COVID-19 pandemic and social unrest did not raise a triable issue. The court found that the pandemic and social unrest did not fundamentally change the nature of the outstanding contractual rights and obligations from what the parties could reasonably have contemplated at the time of the execution of the Tenancy Agreement.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Doctrine of Frustration**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, an unforeseen event (COVID-19 pandemic in precedent p and the explosion in the current case) occurred after the contract was formed, which the parties did not provide for in the contract.

- **Legal Concept 2: Fundamental Change in Contractual Obligations**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In precedent p, the court examined whether the pandemic fundamentally changed the nature of the contractual obligations. Similarly, in the current case, we need to determine whether the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer fundamentally changes the contractual obligations.

- **Legal Concept 3: Performance Rendered Impossible or Radically Different**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In precedent p, the court considered whether the pandemic rendered the performance of the contract impossible or radically different. In the current case, we must assess whether the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer makes the performance of the contract impossible or radically different.

- **Legal Concept 4: Adequacy of Alternative Performance**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In precedent p, the court noted that the tenant could still operate a retail outlet or hair salon despite the closure of the beauty parlour. In the current case, we need to evaluate whether the replacement of the Hamilton Flyer with the Selby Miner constitutes an adequate alternative performance.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of an unforeseen event occurring after the contract was formed, which the parties did not provide for in the contract, and where the event does not fundamentally change the nature of the outstanding contractual rights and obligations, the court should decide that the doctrine of frustration does not apply. This rule was justified in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD because the positive effects (E+) of maintaining contractual stability and predictability outweighed the negative effects (E-) of enforcing the contract despite the unforeseen event. The court emphasized that the pandemic did not fundamentally alter the tenant's ability to perform its contractual obligations, and thus, the contract was not frustrated.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Doctrine of Frustration**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, an unforeseen event (COVID-19 pandemic in precedent and the explosion in the current case) occurred after the contract was formed, which the parties did not provide for in the contract.

- **Legal Concept 2: Fundamental Change in Contractual Obligations**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In precedent, the court examined whether the pandemic fundamentally changed the nature of the contractual obligations. Similarly, in the current case, we need to determine whether the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer fundamentally changes the contractual obligations.

- **Legal Concept 3: Performance Rendered Impossible or Radically Different**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In precedent, the court considered whether the pandemic rendered the performance of the contract impossible or radically different. In the current case, we must assess whether the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer makes the performance of the contract impossible or radically different.

- **Legal Concept 4: Adequacy of Alternative Performance**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In precedent, the court noted that the tenant could still operate a retail outlet or hair salon despite the closure of the beauty parlour. In the current case, we need to evaluate whether the replacement of the Hamilton Flyer with the Selby Miner constitutes an adequate alternative performance.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Contractual Stability and Predictability**: Enforcing the contract despite the unforeseen event maintains the stability and predictability of contractual relationships. Parties can rely on the terms they agreed upon, knowing that minor or temporary disruptions will not discharge their obligations.

2. **Encouragement of Risk Management**: By not allowing the doctrine of frustration to apply too readily, parties are encouraged to include specific provisions for risk and damage in their contracts. This promotes thorough and careful contract drafting.

3. **Economic Efficiency**: Allowing the contract to continue with the Selby Miner as a replacement ensures that the economic activities related to the tourist trips can proceed, albeit in a modified form. This avoids the economic waste that would result from discharging the contract entirely.

4. **Fairness and Equity**: The replacement of the Hamilton Flyer with the Selby Miner, while not identical, still provides a similar service. This ensures that the parties receive a substantial part of the benefit they bargained for, which aligns with principles of fairness and equity.

Therefore, applying the rule from SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD to the current case, the court should find that the doctrine of frustration does not discharge the contracts of Luke and Peter with the Yorkshire Dales Railway. Luke should not be able to recover the £5,000 spent on the train, nor should Peter be able to recover the £100 paid for the tickets, as the performance of the contract has not been rendered impossible or radically different by the unforeseen event.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the tenant could still operate a retail outlet or hair salon despite the closure of the beauty parlour. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling (maintaining contractual stability and predictability) outweighed any potential drawbacks (enforcing the contract despite the unforeseen event) because the tenant's ability to perform its contractual obligations was not fundamentally altered. However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as the Hamilton Flyer was completely destroyed, and the replacement with the Selby Miner does not provide the same unique experience that Peter specifically contracted for, nor does it allow Luke to complete his restoration work on the Hamilton Flyer.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer, that was not present in **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer makes it impossible for Luke to complete his restoration work and for Peter to relive the specific experience he contracted for. Due to the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer, applying the same outcome (non-application of the doctrine of frustration) in our case would have more negative consequences, such as denying Luke compensation for his work and denying Peter the unique experience he paid for, than positive ones. Unlike in **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD**, where the tenant could still perform its contractual obligations in a different form, the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer fundamentally changes the nature of the contractual obligations for both Luke and Peter, making the doctrine of frustration more applicable in this case.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD** should be stated as: "When both [an unforeseen event occurs after the contract was formed, which the parties did not provide for in the contract] and [the unforeseen event does not fundamentally change the nature of the outstanding contractual rights and obligations], the court should decide [that the doctrine of frustration does not apply]." Omitting [the unforeseen event does not fundamentally change the nature of the outstanding contractual rights and obligations] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of enforcing contracts in situations where the performance has become impossible or radically different, thereby causing significant unfairness to the parties]. Indeed, the opinion in **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD** explicitly states that the pandemic did not fundamentally alter the tenant's ability to perform its contractual obligations, and thus, the contract was not frustrated.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties easily escaping their contractual obligations due to minor or temporary disruptions, thereby undermining contractual stability and predictability]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [parties escaping their obligations due to minor disruptions]. The destruction of the Hamilton Flyer is a significant and permanent event that fundamentally changes the nature of the contractual obligations for both Luke and Peter. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The contracts in question have been rendered impossible or radically different due to the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer, justifying the application of the doctrine of frustration.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of the tenant being able to continue operating a different part of their business, which was present in the precedent case **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of unforeseen events leading to potential frustration would lead to the undesirable consequence of denying relief to parties whose contractual obligations have been rendered impossible or radically different due to significant and permanent events. Conversely, not requiring the ability to continue operating a different part of the business would allow for a more equitable outcome, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, such as fairness and the prevention of undue hardship. This approach ensures that parties are not unfairly held to contracts that have become impossible to perform due to unforeseen and significant events.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of the tenant being able to continue operating a different part of their business, which was present in **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD**, we have the additional factor of the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of an unforeseen event occurring after the contract was formed, serves a similar function to the ability to continue operating a different part of the business in the precedent case. Given the presence of the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer, we submit that the reasoning in **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD** still applies, as the positive effects on fairness and the prevention of undue hardship would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. The complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer fundamentally changes the nature of the contractual obligations for both Luke and Peter, justifying the application of the doctrine of frustration in this case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the occurrence of an unforeseen event after the contract was formed and the need to determine whether this event fundamentally changes the nature of the contractual obligations. However, it also differs significantly in that the Hamilton Flyer was completely destroyed, making the performance of the contract impossible or radically different, whereas in the precedent case, the tenant could still perform its contractual obligations in a different form.

The proposed legal rule from **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD**—that the doctrine of frustration does not apply when an unforeseen event does not fundamentally change the nature of the outstanding contractual rights and obligations—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point from the initial analogy that maintaining contractual stability and predictability is crucial, and the counterargument that the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer fundamentally changes the nature of the contractual obligations, justifying the application of the doctrine of frustration.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, prevention of undue hardship, and the doctrine of frustration, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the doctrine of frustration should apply in the current case. The complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer makes it impossible for Luke to complete his restoration work and for Peter to relive the specific experience he contracted for, fundamentally altering the nature of their contractual obligations.

Therefore, the contracts of Luke and Peter with the Yorkshire Dales Railway should be discharged under the doctrine of frustration. Luke should be able to recover the £5,000 spent on the train, and Peter should be able to recover the £100 paid for the tickets, as the performance of the contract has been rendered impossible or radically different by the unforeseen event. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency, ensuring that parties are not unfairly held to contracts that have become impossible to perform due to significant and unforeseen events.

### Major Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - A contract governed by law applicable to the Colony has become impossible of performance or been otherwise frustrated.
   - The parties thereto have for that reason been discharged from the further performance of the contract.

   Consequences:
   - All sums paid or payable to any party in pursuance of the contract before the time when the parties were so discharged shall, in the case of sums so paid, be recoverable from him as money received by him for the use of the party by whom the sums were paid.
   - In the case of sums so payable, cease to be so payable.

   Exceptions:
   - If the party to whom the sums were so paid or payable incurred expenses before the time of discharge in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, the court may, if it considers it just to do so having regard to all the circumstances of the case, allow him to retain or, as the case may be, recover the whole or any part of the sums so paid or payable, not being an amount in excess of the expenses so incurred.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3

   Conditions:
   - Any party to the contract has, by reason of anything done by any other party thereto in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, obtained a valuable benefit (other than a payment of money to which subsection (2) applies) before the time of discharge.

   Consequences:
   - There shall be recoverable from him by the said other party such sum (if any), not exceeding the value of the said benefit to the party obtaining it, as the court considers just, having regard to all the circumstances of the case.

   Exceptions:
   - None.

   Conditions:
   - Any person has assumed obligations under the contract in consideration of the conferring of a benefit by any other party to the contract upon any other person, whether a party to the contract or not.

   Consequences:
   - The court may, if in all the circumstances of the case it considers it just to do so, treat for the purposes of subsection (3) any benefit so conferred as a benefit obtained by the person who has assumed the obligations as aforesaid.

   Exceptions:

### Minor Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2:
   - The contract between Luke and the Yorkshire Dales Railway has become impossible of performance due to the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer.
   - The parties have been discharged from further performance of the contract.
   - Luke has spent £5,000 working on the train prior to its destruction.
   - Luke was due to be paid £8,000 on completion of the work.
   - Luke can recover the £5,000 spent as money received by the Yorkshire Dales Railway for his use.
   - The £8,000 payable to Luke ceases to be payable.
   - However, the court may allow the Yorkshire Dales Railway to retain or recover the whole or any part of the sums paid or payable, not exceeding the expenses incurred, if it considers it just.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3:
   - Peter has paid £100 for tickets on the Hamilton Flyer.
   - The contract has become impossible of performance due to the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer.
   - Peter has not obtained any valuable benefit before the time of discharge.
   - Therefore, Peter can recover the £100 paid for the tickets.

3. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 6:
   - This subsection does not apply to the current scenario as there is no indication that any person has assumed obligations under the contract in consideration of the conferring of a benefit by any other party to the contract upon any other person.

### Conclusion:

The doctrine of frustration would discharge the contracts between Luke and Peter with the Yorkshire Dales Railway. Luke can recover the £5,000 spent on the train, and the £8,000 payable to him ceases to be payable. Peter can recover the £100 paid for the tickets.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR")

In the case of WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" [2022] HKCFI 2036; HCA 954/2020 (precedent p), the court ruled that the defendants were entitled to at least 50% rent abatement due to the premises being rendered unfit for use and occupation by supervening events beyond the control of either party. The court also held that the defendants had plausible counterclaims for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and derogation from grant, which warranted a trial to resolve factual disputes.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Frustration of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, supervening events (social unrest and pandemic in precedent p; explosion in current case c) occurred that were beyond the control of either party and were not contemplated at the time of contract formation.

- **Legal Concept 2: Implied Terms and Expectations**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In both cases, the contracts were based on certain expectations (constant influx of tourists in precedent p; specific experience of riding the Hamilton Flyer in current case c) that were fundamentally altered by the supervening events.

- **Legal Concept 3: Risk Allocation**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: Both cases involve contracts that were silent on the issue of risk and damage, requiring the court to determine the allocation of risk in light of the supervening events.

- **Legal Concept 4: Remedies and Relief**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In both cases, the parties sought relief from their contractual obligations due to the supervening events (rent abatement and counterclaims in precedent p; potential discharge of contract and recovery of monies in current case c).

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR")

This suggests a general rule that when we see a supervening event that fundamentally alters the expectations and obligations under a contract, the court should consider whether the contract is frustrated and whether the parties are entitled to relief from their obligations. This rule was justified in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" because the supervening events (social unrest and pandemic) significantly changed the nature of the contractual obligations, making it unjust to hold the parties to the literal terms of the contract. The positive effects (E+) of this outcome include fairness and justice in contractual relationships, while the negative effects (E-) are minimal as the court ensures that relief is granted only in clear and obvious cases of frustration.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case involving Luke and Peter, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR") are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Frustration of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, supervening events (social unrest and pandemic in the precedent; explosion in the current case) occurred that were beyond the control of either party and were not contemplated at the time of contract formation.

- **Legal Concept 2: Implied Terms and Expectations**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In both cases, the contracts were based on certain expectations (constant influx of tourists in the precedent; specific experience of riding the Hamilton Flyer in the current case) that were fundamentally altered by the supervening events.

- **Legal Concept 3: Risk Allocation**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: Both cases involve contracts that were silent on the issue of risk and damage, requiring the court to determine the allocation of risk in light of the supervening events.

- **Legal Concept 4: Remedies and Relief**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In both cases, the parties sought relief from their contractual obligations due to the supervening events (rent abatement and counterclaims in the precedent; potential discharge of contract and recovery of monies in the current case).

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR", it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Fairness and Justice**: Just as in the precedent case, applying the doctrine of frustration would ensure that neither Luke nor Peter is unfairly held to a contract that has been fundamentally altered by unforeseen events. For Luke, the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer means he can no longer complete his work, and for Peter, the specific experience he contracted for is no longer available.

2. **Risk Allocation**: The court's intervention would appropriately allocate the risk of the unforeseen explosion, which was not contemplated by either party at the time of contract formation. This aligns with the principle that contracts should not bind parties to obligations that have become radically different due to supervening events.

3. **Economic Efficiency**: Allowing Luke to recover his expenses and Peter to get a refund for his tickets would mitigate the economic losses suffered due to the explosion. This would promote economic efficiency by ensuring that parties are not unduly burdened by events beyond their control.

4. **Legal Consistency**: Applying the same legal principles consistently across similar cases ensures predictability and stability in the law, which is crucial for contractual relationships.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR", it would have the positive effects of fairness, appropriate risk allocation, economic efficiency, and legal consistency.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case

In the precedent case **WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR"**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of an **abatement clause** in the tenancy agreement. This abatement clause was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling (rent abatement for the tenant due to premises being unfit for use) outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided a clear contractual mechanism for adjusting rent in the event of supervening circumstances that rendered the premises unfit for use. However, in our current case, this crucial **abatement clause** is notably absent as the contract between Luke and the Yorkshire Dales Railway, and between Peter and the Yorkshire Dales Railway, does not contain any specific provisions addressing the allocation of risk or the consequences of the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case

Our current case involves an important factor **(the specific nature of the Hamilton Flyer experience)** that was not present in **WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR"**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the unique and irreplaceable nature of the Hamilton Flyer experience (including the historical significance and the promise of riding in the driver's seat) is central to Peter's contract. Due to this unique factor, applying the same outcome (discharge of contract due to frustration) in our case would have more negative consequences such as **loss of a unique and irreplaceable experience** and **emotional distress** for Peter, unlike in **WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR"** where the premises could be restored or replaced, and the primary concern was financial loss. Therefore, the presence of this unique factor in our current case necessitates a different approach to ensure that the specific expectations and emotional value attached to the Hamilton Flyer experience are adequately considered.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from **WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR"** should be stated as: "When both [supervening events fundamentally altering the expectations and obligations under a contract] and [the presence of an abatement clause or specific contractual mechanism addressing the consequences of such events] are present, the court should decide [to grant relief from contractual obligations, such as rent abatement or discharge of the contract]." Omitting [the presence of an abatement clause or specific contractual mechanism] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q], which is the potential for unfairness and unpredictability in contractual relationships, as parties would be left without clear guidance on how to handle unforeseen events. Indeed, the opinion in **WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR"** explicitly states that [the abatement clause was crucial to their decision], as it provided a clear mechanism for adjusting rent in the event of supervening circumstances that rendered the premises unfit for use.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in **WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR"** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties being unfairly bound to contracts that have been fundamentally altered by unforeseen events without any contractual mechanism to address such changes]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [this specific undesirable consequence occurring] because the contracts between Luke and the Yorkshire Dales Railway, and between Peter and the Yorkshire Dales Railway, do not contain any specific provisions addressing the allocation of risk or the consequences of the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should consider the unique factors in our case, such as the specific nature of the Hamilton Flyer experience and the absence of any contractual mechanism addressing the consequences of its destruction, to ensure a fair and just outcome.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction

While it's true that our case lacks the abatement clause, which was present in the precedent case WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR", requiring this factor for all similar cases of supervening events fundamentally altering the expectations and obligations under a contract would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would mean that parties to contracts without such clauses would be unfairly bound to their obligations despite unforeseen and uncontrollable events that radically change the nature of the contract. Conversely, not requiring the presence of an abatement clause would allow for a more equitable outcome, ensuring that parties are not unduly penalized for circumstances beyond their control. This better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and justice in contract law, which aim to prevent parties from being held to terms that have become fundamentally different due to unforeseen events.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution

Although our case lacks the abatement clause, which was present in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR", we have the additional factor of the specific and unique nature of the Hamilton Flyer experience. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of supervening events fundamentally altering the expectations and obligations under the contract, serves a similar function to the abatement clause in the precedent case. Given the presence of this unique factor, we submit that the reasoning in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" still applies, as the positive effects on fairness, appropriate risk allocation, and legal consistency would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR"**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the occurrence of supervening events that were beyond the control of either party and not contemplated at the time of contract formation, and the contracts being silent on the issue of risk and damage. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of an abatement clause in the current case and the unique nature of the Hamilton Flyer experience.

The proposed legal rule of granting relief from contractual obligations when supervening events fundamentally alter the expectations and obligations under a contract finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in the absence of specific contractual mechanisms like an abatement clause.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the absence of an abatement clause in the current case necessitates a different approach to ensure fairness and justice, and the counterargument that the unique nature of the Hamilton Flyer experience serves a similar function to the abatement clause in the precedent case.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, appropriate risk allocation, and legal consistency, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the doctrine of frustration should discharge the contracts of both Luke and Peter with the Yorkshire Dales Railway. This decision is justified because the explosion, an unforeseen and uncontrollable event, has fundamentally altered the nature of the contractual obligations, making it unjust to hold the parties to their original terms.

For Luke, the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer means he can no longer complete his work, and he should be entitled to recover the £5,000 he has already spent. For Peter, the specific experience he contracted for is no longer available, and he should be entitled to a refund of the £100 he paid for the tickets.

This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency, ensuring that parties are not unduly penalized for circumstances beyond their control.

### Minor Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 1 and 2:
- Luke's contract with the Yorkshire Dales Railway has become impossible of performance due to the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer.
- The parties have been discharged from further performance of the contract.
- Luke has spent £5,000 working on the train prior to its destruction.
- Luke was due to be paid £8,000 on completion of the work.
- Therefore, Luke can recover the £5,000 spent as money received by the Yorkshire Dales Railway for his use.
- The £8,000 payable to Luke ceases to be payable.
- However, the court may allow Luke to retain or recover the whole or any part of the sums so paid or payable, not being an amount in excess of the expenses so incurred, if it considers it just to do so.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3:
- Peter has paid £100 for tickets on the Hamilton Flyer.
- The contract has been frustrated due to the destruction of the train.
- Peter can recover the £100 paid as money received by the Yorkshire Dales Railway for his use.

### Conclusion:

The doctrine of frustration would discharge both Luke's and Peter's contracts with the Yorkshire Dales Railway. Luke can recover the £5,000 spent on the train, and the £8,000 payable to him ceases to be payable. However, the court may allow Luke to recover the whole or any part of the sums so paid or payable, not being an amount in excess of the expenses so incurred, if it considers it just to do so. Peter can recover the £100 paid for the tickets.

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD)
In the case of SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD (precedent p), the court ruled that the tenant's claim of frustration due to the COVID-19 pandemic and social unrest did not raise a triable issue. The court found that the pandemic and social unrest did not fundamentally change the nature of the outstanding contractual rights and obligations from what the parties could reasonably have contemplated at the time of the execution of the Tenancy Agreement.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Doctrine of Frustration**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, an unforeseen event (COVID-19 pandemic in precedent p and explosion in current case c) occurred after the contract was formed, which the parties did not provide for in the contract.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Fundamental Change in Contractual Obligations**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In both cases, the parties argued that the unforeseen event fundamentally changed the nature of the contractual obligations. In precedent p, the tenant argued that the pandemic made it impossible to fulfill the tenancy agreement. In current case c, Luke and Peter may argue that the explosion made it impossible to fulfill their respective contracts with the Yorkshire Dales Railway.
  
- **Legal Concept 3: Performance of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In both cases, the performance of the contract was interrupted by the unforeseen event. In precedent p, the tenant's business operations were disrupted. In current case c, the Hamilton Flyer was destroyed, preventing Luke from completing his work and Peter from enjoying the booked trip.
  
- **Legal Concept 4: Recovery of Monies Paid**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In both cases, there is a question of whether monies paid or payable can be recovered. In precedent p, the tenant sought relief from rent obligations. In current case c, Luke and Peter may seek to recover the amounts they have paid or are owed.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD)
This suggests a general rule that when we see an unforeseen event that does not fundamentally change the nature of the outstanding contractual rights and obligations from what the parties could reasonably have contemplated at the time of the contract's execution, the court should decide that the doctrine of frustration does not apply, and the contract is not discharged.

This rule was justified in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD because the court found that the COVID-19 pandemic and social unrest, while unforeseen, did not fundamentally alter the tenant's ability to perform the contract. The tenant could still operate a retail outlet or a hair salon, and the mandatory closure of the beauty parlour was temporary and did not affect the tenant's ability to fulfill the primary purpose of the tenancy agreement.

Applying this rule to the current case, the explosion and destruction of the Hamilton Flyer may be seen as fundamentally altering the nature of the contracts with Luke and Peter. Luke cannot complete his restoration work, and Peter cannot enjoy the booked trip on the Hamilton Flyer. Therefore, the doctrine of frustration may apply, potentially discharging their contracts and allowing for the recovery of monies paid or payable.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Doctrine of Frustration**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, an unforeseen event occurred after the contract was formed, which the parties did not provide for in the contract. In precedent p, it was the COVID-19 pandemic and social unrest. In current case c, it is the explosion that destroyed the Hamilton Flyer.

- **Legal Concept 2: Fundamental Change in Contractual Obligations**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In both cases, the parties argued that the unforeseen event fundamentally changed the nature of the contractual obligations. In precedent p, the tenant argued that the pandemic made it impossible to fulfill the tenancy agreement. In current case c, Luke and Peter may argue that the explosion made it impossible to fulfill their respective contracts with the Yorkshire Dales Railway.

- **Legal Concept 3: Performance of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In both cases, the performance of the contract was interrupted by the unforeseen event. In precedent p, the tenant's business operations were disrupted. In current case c, the Hamilton Flyer was destroyed, preventing Luke from completing his work and Peter from enjoying the booked trip.

- **Legal Concept 4: Recovery of Monies Paid**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In both cases, there is a question of whether monies paid or payable can be recovered. In precedent p, the tenant sought relief from rent obligations. In current case c, Luke and Peter may seek to recover the amounts they have paid or are owed.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome: the doctrine of frustration should apply, potentially discharging the contracts and allowing for the recovery of monies paid or payable.

This decision would be justified because, as in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Fairness and Equity**: Applying the doctrine of frustration would ensure that neither Luke nor Peter is unfairly burdened by an unforeseen event that fundamentally alters the nature of their contractual obligations. Luke cannot complete his restoration work, and Peter cannot enjoy the booked trip on the Hamilton Flyer, which was the primary purpose of their contracts.

2. **Legal Consistency**: Consistency in the application of legal principles is crucial for the predictability and stability of the law. By applying the same rule as in the precedent case, the court would uphold the principle that contracts should not be enforced when unforeseen events fundamentally change the nature of the contractual obligations.

3. **Encouragement of Clear Contractual Terms**: This outcome would encourage parties to include clear terms regarding risk and unforeseen events in their contracts, thereby reducing future disputes and promoting better contractual practices.

4. **Economic Efficiency**: Allowing for the recovery of monies paid or payable would mitigate the financial losses suffered by Luke and Peter due to the unforeseen event, promoting economic efficiency and fairness.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD, it would have the positive effects of ensuring fairness, legal consistency, encouraging clear contractual terms, and promoting economic efficiency.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the tenant's business operations were not entirely prevented by the COVID-19 pandemic and social unrest. The tenant could still operate a retail outlet or a hair salon, and the mandatory closure of the beauty parlour was temporary. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—upholding the contract and denying the claim of frustration—outweighed any potential drawbacks because the tenant's ability to perform the primary purpose of the tenancy agreement was not fundamentally altered.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent. The explosion that destroyed the Hamilton Flyer has entirely prevented Luke from completing his restoration work and Peter from enjoying the booked trip on the Hamilton Flyer. Unlike the tenant in the precedent case, Luke and Peter cannot perform any part of their contractual obligations due to the destruction of the subject matter of their contracts. Therefore, the absence of this factor significantly alters the balance of positive and negative effects, making the application of the same outcome inappropriate.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—the complete destruction of the subject matter of the contract (the Hamilton Flyer)—that was not present in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the explosion has rendered it physically and commercially impossible for Luke to complete his restoration work and for Peter to enjoy the booked trip. Due to this factor, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as unfairly burdening Luke and Peter with the financial losses and obligations arising from an event beyond their control, than positive ones, unlike in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD. The complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer fundamentally changes the nature of the outstanding contractual rights and obligations, justifying the application of the doctrine of frustration and allowing for the recovery of monies paid or payable.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD should be stated as: "When both [an unforeseen event occurs after the contract was formed, which the parties did not provide for in the contract] and [the unforeseen event fundamentally changes the nature of the outstanding contractual rights and obligations], the court should decide [that the doctrine of frustration applies, discharging the contract and allowing for the recovery of monies paid or payable]." Omitting [the unforeseen event fundamentally changes the nature of the outstanding contractual rights and obligations] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of parties being unfairly burdened by obligations that have become impossible or radically different to perform due to unforeseen events]. Indeed, the opinion in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD explicitly states that the tenant's ability to perform the primary purpose of the tenancy agreement was not fundamentally altered, which was crucial to their decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties using minor or temporary disruptions as a pretext to escape from their contractual obligations]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [parties using minor or temporary disruptions as a pretext] occurring. The explosion that destroyed the Hamilton Flyer has entirely prevented Luke from completing his restoration work and Peter from enjoying the booked trip, which are not minor or temporary disruptions but rather a complete and permanent destruction of the subject matter of their contracts. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of the tenant's ability to perform the primary purpose of the tenancy agreement despite the unforeseen event, which was present in the precedent case SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD, requiring this factor for all similar cases of unforeseen events fundamentally changing the nature of contractual obligations would lead to the undesirable consequence of parties being unfairly burdened by obligations that have become impossible or radically different to perform due to unforeseen events. Conversely, not requiring this factor would allow for a fairer outcome, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, such as the principle of fairness and the doctrine of frustration, which aims to relieve parties from their contractual obligations when unforeseen events make performance impossible or radically different.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of the tenant's ability to perform the primary purpose of the tenancy agreement despite the unforeseen event, which was present in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD, we have the additional factor of the complete destruction of the subject matter of the contract (the Hamilton Flyer). This complete destruction, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of an unforeseen event fundamentally changing the nature of the contractual obligations, serves a similar function to the tenant's ability to perform the primary purpose in the precedent case. Given the presence of the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer, we submit that the reasoning in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as fairness and the proper application of the doctrine of frustration, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the occurrence of an unforeseen event after the contract was formed and the argument that this event fundamentally changed the nature of the contractual obligations. However, it also differs significantly in that the unforeseen event in the current case—the explosion—completely destroyed the subject matter of the contract (the Hamilton Flyer), making performance impossible.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case, which states that the doctrine of frustration does not apply unless the unforeseen event fundamentally changes the nature of the outstanding contractual rights and obligations, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the argument that the explosion fundamentally altered the contractual obligations in the current case, making it impossible for Luke to complete his restoration work and for Peter to enjoy the booked trip, against the argument that the precedent case involved a situation where the tenant's ability to perform the primary purpose of the tenancy agreement was not fundamentally altered.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, the doctrine of frustration, and the need for legal consistency, we conclude that the doctrine of frustration should apply in the current case. The complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer fundamentally changes the nature of the outstanding contractual rights and obligations, justifying the discharge of the contracts and allowing for the recovery of monies paid or payable.

This decision is reached because the explosion has rendered it physically and commercially impossible for Luke to complete his restoration work and for Peter to enjoy the booked trip, which are not minor or temporary disruptions but rather a complete and permanent destruction of the subject matter of their contracts. Therefore, applying the doctrine of frustration in this case aligns with the principles of fairness and the proper application of the doctrine, ensuring that neither Luke nor Peter is unfairly burdened by an unforeseen event that has made performance impossible.


# Contract Law: Whether the Yorkshire Dales Railway has any liability for the explosion and damage to nearby buildings despite no fault being attributable to any party

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Sections 16, 17, and 18

### Major Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - A contract governed by law applicable to the Colony has become impossible of performance or been otherwise frustrated.
   - The parties thereto have for that reason been discharged from the further performance of the contract.

   Consequences:
   - All sums paid or payable to any party in pursuance of the contract before the time of discharge shall, in the case of sums so paid, be recoverable from him as money received by him for the use of the party by whom the sums were paid.
   - In the case of sums so payable, cease to be so payable.

   Exceptions:
   - If the party to whom the sums were so paid or payable incurred expenses before the time of discharge in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, the court may, if it considers it just to do so having regard to all the circumstances of the case, allow him to retain or recover the whole or any part of the sums so paid or payable, not being an amount in excess of the expenses so incurred.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3

   Conditions:
   - Any party to the contract has, by reason of anything done by any other party thereto in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, obtained a valuable benefit (other than a payment of money to which subsection (2) applies) before the time of discharge.

   Consequences:
   - There shall be recoverable from him by the said other party such sum (if any), not exceeding the value of the said benefit to the party obtaining it, as the court considers just, having regard to all the circumstances of the case.

3. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 17 Subsection 3

   Conditions:
   - Any contract to which this section and sections 16 and 18 apply contains any provision which, upon the true construction of the contract, is intended to have effect in the event of circumstances arising which operate, or would but for the said provision operate, to frustrate the contract, or is intended to have effect whether such circumstances arise or not.

   Consequences:
   - The court shall give effect to the said provision and shall only give effect to section 16 to such extent, if any, as appears to the court to be consistent with the said provision.

4. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 17 Subsection 4

   Conditions:
   - It appears to the court that a part of any contract to which this section and sections 16 and 18 apply can properly be severed from the remainder of the contract, being a part wholly performed before the time of discharge, or so performed except for the payment in respect of that part of the contract of sums which are or can be ascertained under the contract.

   Consequences:
   - The court shall treat that part of the contract as if it were a separate contract and had not been frustrated and shall treat section 16 as only applicable to the remainder of that contract.

5. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 18

   Conditions:
   - Any settlement or agreement between the parties subsequent to date of discharge whereby the rights and liabilities of the contracting parties fell to be determined otherwise than in accordance with sections 16 and 17.

   Consequences:
   - Nothing in sections 16 and 17 shall affect such settlement or agreement.

### Minor Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2:
   - The contract between Luke and the Yorkshire Dales Railway has become impossible of performance due to the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer.
   - The parties have been discharged from further performance of the contract.
   - Luke has spent £5,000 working on the train prior to its destruction.
   - Luke was due to be paid £8,000 on completion of the work.
   - Luke can recover the £5,000 spent as money received by the Yorkshire Dales Railway for his use.
   - The £8,000 payable to Luke ceases to be payable.
   - The court may allow Luke to retain or recover the £5,000 spent, as it is just to do so given the circumstances.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3:
   - Peter has paid £100 for tickets on the Hamilton Flyer.
   - The contract has been frustrated due to the destruction of the train.
   - Peter can recover the £100 paid for the tickets.

### Conclusion:

The doctrine of frustration would discharge the contracts between Luke and Peter with the Yorkshire Dales Railway. Luke can recover the £5,000 spent on the train, and the £8,000 payable to him ceases to be payable. Peter can recover the £100 paid for the tickets.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR")
In the case of WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" [2022] HKCFI 2036; HCA 954/2020 (precedent p), the defendants argued that the plaintiff's actions constituted a breach of the quiet enjoyment covenant and that the contract was frustrated due to extraordinary and unprecedented events (social unrest and the COVID-19 pandemic). The court ruled that the doctrine of frustration did not apply because the events did not render the performance of the contract radically different from what was originally contemplated. The court emphasized that the doctrine of frustration must be kept within very narrow limits and is not to be lightly invoked.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Doctrine of Frustration**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, there were extraordinary and unforeseen events (social unrest and pandemic in precedent p; explosion in current case c) that significantly impacted the performance of the contract.

- **Legal Concept 2: Risk Allocation**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: Both cases involve contracts that are silent on the issue of risk and damage, leaving the court to determine how the risk should be allocated between the parties.

- **Legal Concept 3: Performance of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In both cases, the parties argue that the unforeseen events have made it impossible or radically different to perform the contractual obligations (operation of retail shops in precedent p; restoration and operation of the steam train in current case c).

- **Legal Concept 4: Commercial Expectations**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: Both cases involve commercial expectations that were not met due to the unforeseen events (expectation of tourist customers in precedent p; expectation of operating the Hamilton Flyer in current case c).

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR")
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of extraordinary and unforeseen events significantly impacting the performance of a contract, the court should decide that the doctrine of frustration does not apply unless the performance of the contract has become radically different from what was originally contemplated. This rule was justified in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" because the positive effects (E+) of maintaining contractual obligations and upholding commercial certainty outweighed the negative effects (E-) of the unforeseen events on the parties' expectations and performance. The court emphasized the importance of keeping the doctrine of frustration within narrow limits to avoid undermining the stability and predictability of contractual relationships.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR") are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Doctrine of Frustration**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, there were extraordinary and unforeseen events (social unrest and pandemic in precedent; explosion in current case) that significantly impacted the performance of the contract.

- **Legal Concept 2: Risk Allocation**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: Both cases involve contracts that are silent on the issue of risk and damage, leaving the court to determine how the risk should be allocated between the parties.

- **Legal Concept 3: Performance of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In both cases, the parties argue that the unforeseen events have made it impossible or radically different to perform the contractual obligations (operation of retail shops in precedent; restoration and operation of the steam train in current case).

- **Legal Concept 4: Commercial Expectations**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: Both cases involve commercial expectations that were not met due to the unforeseen events (expectation of tourist customers in precedent; expectation of operating the Hamilton Flyer in current case).

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR". This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Commercial Certainty**: Maintaining the contractual obligations despite unforeseen events ensures that parties can rely on the stability and predictability of their agreements. This is crucial for commercial transactions and long-term planning.

2. **Narrow Application of Frustration Doctrine**: By keeping the doctrine of frustration within narrow limits, the court avoids undermining the principle that contracts should be honored unless performance becomes radically different from what was originally contemplated. This promotes fairness and discourages parties from seeking to escape their obligations due to mere inconvenience or increased difficulty.

3. **Risk Allocation**: The decision reinforces the implicit understanding that parties bear certain risks in commercial contracts. In the current case, just as in the precedent, the risk of economic downturn or unforeseen events affecting business operations is generally borne by the party operating the business (Luke and Peter in the current case).

4. **Encouraging Detailed Contract Drafting**: By not lightly invoking the doctrine of frustration, the court encourages parties to explicitly address risk allocation and contingencies in their contracts. This leads to more comprehensive and clear agreements, reducing the likelihood of disputes.

Therefore, applying the same rule from WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" to the current case, the doctrine of frustration should not discharge Luke's and Peter's contracts with the Yorkshire Dales Railway. The contracts should be upheld, and any monies paid or payable should be addressed according to the original terms of the agreements, unless there is a specific clause that provides otherwise.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR", the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the tenant's business was still operational, albeit under significantly reduced circumstances. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—upholding commercial certainty and maintaining contractual obligations—outweighed any potential drawbacks because the tenant could still operate their business, even if at a loss. However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as the Hamilton Flyer was completely destroyed in an explosion, making it impossible for Luke to complete his restoration work and for Peter to experience the train ride he had booked. The destruction of the train means that the performance of the contract is not just more onerous or less profitable, but entirely impossible.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—the complete destruction of the subject matter of the contract (the Hamilton Flyer)—that was not present in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR". This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it makes the performance of the contract entirely impossible, rather than merely more difficult or less profitable. Due to the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer, applying the same outcome (i.e., not invoking the doctrine of frustration) in our case would have more negative consequences such as unjustly holding the parties to a contract that cannot be performed, unlike in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" where the business could still operate, albeit under reduced circumstances. This would undermine the fairness and reasonableness that the doctrine of frustration aims to uphold.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" should be stated as "When both the fact pattern of extraordinary and unforeseen events significantly impacting the performance of a contract (i*) and the complete destruction of the subject matter of the contract (m) are present, the court should decide that the doctrine of frustration applies (o)." Omitting the complete destruction of the subject matter (m) from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of unjustly holding parties to a contract that cannot be performed, which would undermine the fairness and reasonableness that the doctrine of frustration aims to uphold. Indeed, the opinion in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" explicitly states that the business could still operate, albeit under reduced circumstances, which was crucial to their decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of parties escaping their contractual obligations due to mere inconvenience or increased difficulty. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this occurring because the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer makes the performance of the contract entirely impossible, not just more difficult or less profitable. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of the business still being operational, which was present in the precedent case WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR", requiring this factor for all similar cases of extraordinary and unforeseen events significantly impacting the performance of a contract would lead to the undesirable consequence of unjustly holding parties to contracts that have become impossible to perform. Conversely, not requiring the business to still be operational would allow for a more just and reasonable application of the doctrine of frustration, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area. The doctrine of frustration is intended to release parties from their contractual obligations when unforeseen events make performance radically different from what was originally contemplated, ensuring fairness and preventing undue hardship.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of the business still being operational, which was present in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR", we have the additional factor of the complete destruction of the subject matter of the contract (the Hamilton Flyer). This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of extraordinary and unforeseen events significantly impacting the performance of a contract, serves a similar function to the operational business factor in the precedent case. Given the presence of the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer, we submit that the reasoning in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as fairness and reasonableness would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. The complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer makes the performance of the contract entirely impossible, justifying the application of the doctrine of frustration to discharge the contracts and allowing for the recovery of any monies paid or payable.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR", the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of extraordinary and unforeseen events significantly impacting the performance of a contract and the contracts being silent on the issue of risk and damage. However, it also differs in a crucial aspect: the complete destruction of the subject matter of the contract (the Hamilton Flyer) in the current case, which was not present in the precedent.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case—that the doctrine of frustration does not apply unless the performance of the contract has become radically different from what was originally contemplated—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer, which makes the performance of the contract entirely impossible, not just more difficult or less profitable.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point from the initial analogy that upholding commercial certainty and maintaining contractual obligations are crucial for legal consistency and predictability. On the other hand, the rebuttal's emphasis on the complete destruction of the subject matter as a distinguishing factor that justifies the application of the doctrine of frustration is compelling.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, reasonableness, and the narrow application of the doctrine of frustration, we conclude that the doctrine of frustration should apply in the current case. The complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer makes the performance of the contracts entirely impossible, which aligns with the principle that contracts should not bind parties to obligations that have become radically different from what was originally contemplated.

Therefore, the contracts between Luke, Peter, and the Yorkshire Dales Railway should be discharged under the doctrine of frustration. Luke should be entitled to recover the £5,000 he spent working on the train, and Peter should be entitled to a refund of the £100 he paid for the tickets. This decision serves justice and legal consistency by recognizing the fundamental change in circumstances and ensuring that parties are not unfairly held to impossible obligations.

   Conditions:
   - A contract contains any provision which, upon the true construction of the contract, is intended to have effect in the event of circumstances arising which operate, or would but for the said provision operate, to frustrate the contract, or is intended to have effect whether such circumstances arise or not.

   Consequences:
   - The court shall give effect to the said provision and shall only give effect to section 16 to such extent, if any, as appears to the court to be consistent with the said provision.

   Exceptions:

### Minor Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2:
- The contract between Luke and the Yorkshire Dales Railway has become impossible of performance due to the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer.
- The parties have been discharged from further performance of the contract.
- Luke has spent £5,000 working on the train prior to its destruction.
- Luke was due to be paid £8,000 on completion of the work.
- Luke can recover the £5,000 spent as money received by the Yorkshire Dales Railway for his use.
- The £8,000 payable to Luke ceases to be payable.
- However, the court may allow Luke to retain or recover the whole or any part of the sums paid or payable, not exceeding the expenses incurred (£5,000).

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3:
- Peter has paid £100 for tickets on the Hamilton Flyer.
- The contract has been frustrated due to the destruction of the train.
- Peter has not obtained any valuable benefit before the time of discharge.
- Therefore, this section does not apply to Peter.

3. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 6:
- This section does not apply to Luke or Peter as there is no indication of obligations assumed under the contract in consideration of the conferring of a benefit by any other party.

4. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 17 Subsection 3:
- The contract is silent on the issue of risk and damage.
- Therefore, this section does not apply.

5. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 17 Subsection 4:
- The contract cannot be severed as the work on the Hamilton Flyer was not wholly performed before the time of discharge.
- Therefore, this section does not apply.

### Conclusion:

The doctrine of frustration would discharge the contracts between Luke and the Yorkshire Dales Railway, and Peter and the Yorkshire Dales Railway. Luke can recover the £5,000 spent on the train, and the £8,000 payable to him ceases to be payable. Peter can recover the £100 paid for the tickets.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD)

In the case of SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD (precedent p), the court ruled that the tenant's claim of having accepted a rent reduction offer was not valid because there was no sufficient evidence of acceptance, either orally or by conduct, and the tenant did not comply with the terms of the offer. Additionally, the court found that the tenant's claim of frustration due to the COVID-19 pandemic did not raise a triable issue because the pandemic did not fundamentally change the nature of the contractual obligations.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Acceptance of Contractual Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In SUNBROAD, the tenant did not countersign the rent reduction offer and failed to comply with its terms. In the current case, Luke's contract is silent on the issue of risk and damage, and there is no evidence of any implied acceptance of risk by either party.

- **Legal Concept 2: Doctrine of Frustration**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In SUNBROAD, the tenant argued that the COVID-19 pandemic frustrated the contract, but the court found that the pandemic did not fundamentally change the nature of the contractual obligations. In the current case, the explosion that destroyed the Hamilton Flyer could be argued to frustrate the contracts of both Luke and Peter, as it makes the performance of the contracts impossible.

- **Legal Concept 3: Implied Terms in Contracts**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In SUNBROAD, the court examined the entire course of negotiations to determine if there were any implied terms. In the current case, the court would need to consider whether there are any implied terms regarding risk and damage to the train in Luke's contract.

- **Legal Concept 4: Recovery of Monies Paid**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In SUNBROAD, the court did not address the issue of recovery of monies paid as it was not relevant to the case. In the current case, Peter seeks to recover the £100 paid for the tickets, and Luke seeks to recover the £5,000 spent on the train.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a supervening event that makes the performance of a contract impossible (i*), the court should decide that the doctrine of frustration applies, discharging the contract and allowing for the recovery of monies paid (outcome o). This rule was justified in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD because the court found that the COVID-19 pandemic did not fundamentally change the nature of the contractual obligations, and thus, the doctrine of frustration did not apply. However, in the current case, the explosion that destroyed the Hamilton Flyer fundamentally changes the nature of the contractual obligations, making it impossible for Luke to complete the restoration work and for Peter to enjoy the booked trip. Therefore, applying the doctrine of frustration would discharge their contracts and allow for the recovery of monies paid or payable.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Acceptance of Contractual Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In SUNBROAD, the tenant did not countersign the rent reduction offer and failed to comply with its terms. In the current case, Luke's contract is silent on the issue of risk and damage, and there is no evidence of any implied acceptance of risk by either party.

- **Legal Concept 2: Doctrine of Frustration**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In SUNBROAD, the tenant argued that the COVID-19 pandemic frustrated the contract, but the court found that the pandemic did not fundamentally change the nature of the contractual obligations. In the current case, the explosion that destroyed the Hamilton Flyer could be argued to frustrate the contracts of both Luke and Peter, as it makes the performance of the contracts impossible.

- **Legal Concept 3: Implied Terms in Contracts**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In SUNBROAD, the court examined the entire course of negotiations to determine if there were any implied terms. In the current case, the court would need to consider whether there are any implied terms regarding risk and damage to the train in Luke's contract.

- **Legal Concept 4: Recovery of Monies Paid**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In SUNBROAD, the court did not address the issue of recovery of monies paid as it was not relevant to the case. In the current case, Peter seeks to recover the £100 paid for the tickets, and Luke seeks to recover the £5,000 spent on the train.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Fairness and Equity**: Applying the doctrine of frustration would ensure that neither Luke nor Peter is unfairly burdened by circumstances beyond their control. Luke should not be expected to bear the financial loss of the destroyed train, and Peter should not be deprived of his money for a service that can no longer be provided.

2. **Legal Consistency**: Consistency in the application of legal principles is crucial for the predictability and reliability of the legal system. By applying the doctrine of frustration in this case, the court would reinforce the principle that contracts can be discharged when unforeseen events make performance impossible.

3. **Encouragement of Good Faith**: Recognizing the frustration of the contract would encourage parties to act in good faith and acknowledge when performance is genuinely impossible, rather than attempting to enforce impractical or unjust terms.

4. **Economic Efficiency**: Allowing for the recovery of monies paid or payable would prevent economic waste and ensure that resources are allocated more efficiently. Luke can seek other opportunities for his skills, and Peter can use his funds for alternative arrangements.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD, it would have the positive effects of fairness, legal consistency, encouragement of good faith, and economic efficiency.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the tenant did not comply with the terms of the rent reduction offer and failed to provide sufficient evidence of acceptance, either orally or by conduct. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—such as upholding the integrity of contractual agreements and preventing unjust enrichment—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it demonstrated that the tenant did not meet the necessary legal requirements to claim a rent reduction.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as there is no issue of non-compliance or lack of evidence of acceptance. Instead, the contracts between Luke and the Yorkshire Dales Railway, and Peter and the Yorkshire Dales Railway, are silent on the issue of risk and damage, and the explosion that destroyed the Hamilton Flyer is an unforeseen event that makes the performance of the contracts impossible. Therefore, the absence of non-compliance or lack of evidence of acceptance in the current case means that the same reasoning cannot be directly applied.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—the complete destruction of the subject matter of the contract (the Hamilton Flyer)—that was not present in **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of a supervening event making the performance of a contract impossible. Because of the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer, applying the same outcome (i.e., not recognizing the doctrine of frustration) in our case would have more negative consequences, such as unfairly burdening Luke and Peter with the financial loss and depriving them of the benefit of their contracts, than positive ones. Unlike in **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD**, where the tenant's non-compliance and lack of evidence of acceptance were central to the decision, the current case involves an unforeseen event that fundamentally changes the nature of the contractual obligations, making it justifiable to apply the doctrine of frustration to discharge the contracts and allow for the recovery of monies paid or payable.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD** should be stated as: "When both [a supervening event that makes the performance of a contract impossible] and [the complete destruction of the subject matter of the contract] are present, the court should decide [that the doctrine of frustration applies, discharging the contract and allowing for the recovery of monies paid or payable]." Omitting [the complete destruction of the subject matter of the contract] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of unfairly burdening parties with the financial loss and depriving them of the benefit of their contracts due to circumstances beyond their control]. Indeed, the opinion in **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD** explicitly states that [the tenant's non-compliance and lack of evidence of acceptance were crucial to their decision, highlighting the importance of the specific circumstances in determining the application of the doctrine of frustration].

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of tenants unjustly claiming rent reductions without sufficient evidence of acceptance or compliance with the terms]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [parties unjustly claiming benefits without compliance or evidence of acceptance]. Instead, the current case involves an unforeseen event (the explosion) that fundamentally changes the nature of the contractual obligations, making performance impossible. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The correct application of the doctrine of frustration in this case would ensure fairness and equity, legal consistency, encouragement of good faith, and economic efficiency.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of non-compliance or lack of evidence of acceptance, which was present in the precedent case **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of a supervening event that makes the performance of a contract impossible would lead to the undesirable consequence of unfairly burdening parties with the financial loss and depriving them of the benefit of their contracts due to circumstances beyond their control. Conversely, not requiring non-compliance or lack of evidence of acceptance would allow for the desirable outcome of ensuring fairness and equity, legal consistency, encouragement of good faith, and economic efficiency. This better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, which aim to prevent unjust enrichment and ensure that parties are not unfairly penalized for unforeseen events that make contract performance impossible.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of non-compliance or lack of evidence of acceptance, which was present in **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD**, we have the additional factor of the complete destruction of the subject matter of the contract (the Hamilton Flyer). This complete destruction, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of a supervening event making the performance of a contract impossible, serves a similar function to non-compliance or lack of evidence of acceptance in the precedent case. Given the presence of the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer, we submit that the reasoning in **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD** still applies, as the positive effects on fairness and equity, legal consistency, encouragement of good faith, and economic efficiency would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the application of the doctrine of frustration and the need to consider the entire course of negotiations or circumstances surrounding the contract. However, it also differs significantly in that the current case involves the complete destruction of the subject matter of the contract (the Hamilton Flyer), which was not a factor in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule that "when a supervening event makes the performance of a contract impossible, the court should decide that the doctrine of frustration applies, discharging the contract and allowing for the recovery of monies paid or payable" finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the unique circumstances of the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer fundamentally changes the nature of the contractual obligations, making performance impossible (a point in favor of applying the doctrine of frustration). Conversely, the precedent case emphasized the importance of compliance and evidence of acceptance, which are not directly applicable here.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, equity, legal consistency, encouragement of good faith, and economic efficiency, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the doctrine of frustration should apply in the current case. This decision is justified because the explosion that destroyed the Hamilton Flyer fundamentally changes the nature of the contractual obligations, making it impossible for Luke to complete the restoration work and for Peter to enjoy the booked trip. Therefore, applying the doctrine of frustration would discharge their contracts and allow for the recovery of monies paid or payable.

In summary, the key factors that influenced this outcome are:
1. The complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer, which makes the performance of the contracts impossible.
2. The absence of any implied acceptance of risk by either party in Luke's contract.
3. The need to ensure fairness and equity by not unfairly burdening Luke and Peter with the financial loss due to circumstances beyond their control.
4. The importance of legal consistency and the encouragement of good faith in contractual dealings.

Therefore, the contracts between Luke and the Yorkshire Dales Railway, and Peter and the Yorkshire Dales Railway, should be discharged under the doctrine of frustration, and any monies paid or payable should be recoverable.

### Minor Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2:
- Luke's contract with the Yorkshire Dales Railway has become impossible of performance due to the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer.
- The parties have been discharged from further performance of the contract.
- Luke has spent £5,000 working on the train prior to its destruction.

### Relevant law:

Vember Lord Ltd v. The Swatch Group (Hong Kong) Ltd [2023] HKCA 371

### Major Premise:

1. Vember Lord Ltd v. The Swatch Group (Hong Kong) Ltd [2023] HKCA 371

   Conditions:
   - There is a supervening event that thwarts the commonly held purposes by the parties when they entered into the contract.
   - The contractual obligations are rendered radically or fundamentally different from what was agreed upon in the contract.

   Consequences:
   - The contract may be frustrated.

   Exceptions:
   - The primary obligation to lease has not been rendered impossible by the supervening event.
   - The supervening event does not affect the occupation or use of the premises as a discrete physical space.

### Minor Premise:

1. For Luke:
   - The supervening event is the explosion that destroyed the Hamilton Flyer.
   - The commonly held purpose was the restoration of the Hamilton Flyer.
   - The contractual obligation to restore the Hamilton Flyer is rendered impossible because the train no longer exists.
   - The primary obligation to restore the train has been rendered impossible by the supervening event.
   - The supervening event affects the subject matter of the contract (the Hamilton Flyer).

   Therefore, the conditions for frustration are satisfied, and no exceptions apply.

2. For Peter:
   - The supervening event is the explosion that destroyed the Hamilton Flyer.
   - The commonly held purpose was to provide a nostalgic experience on the Hamilton Flyer.
   - The contractual obligation to provide a ride on the Hamilton Flyer is rendered impossible because the train no longer exists.
   - The primary obligation to provide the ride has been rendered impossible by the supervening event.
   - The supervening event affects the subject matter of the contract (the Hamilton Flyer).

   Therefore, the conditions for frustration are satisfied, and no exceptions apply.

### Conclusion:

The doctrine of frustration applies to both Luke and Peter's contracts with the Yorkshire Dales Railway. The contracts are discharged due to the impossibility of performance caused by the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer. Luke can recover the £5,000 he spent on the restoration work, and Peter can recover the £100 he paid for the tickets.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD)
In the case of SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD (precedent p), the court ruled that the tenant's claim of frustration due to the COVID-19 pandemic and social unrest did not raise a triable issue. The court found that the pandemic and social unrest did not fundamentally change the nature of the outstanding contractual rights and obligations from what the parties could reasonably have contemplated at the time of the execution of the Tenancy Agreement. Therefore, the contract was not discharged by frustration.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Doctrine of Frustration**: In both cases, the parties are arguing that unforeseen events have made the performance of the contract impossible or radically different from what was agreed upon.
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In SUNBROAD, the tenant argued that the COVID-19 pandemic and social unrest frustrated the lease. In the current case, Luke and Peter argue that the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer frustrates their contracts.
- **Legal Concept 2: Impossibility of Performance**: The argument hinges on whether the unforeseen event has made the performance of the contract impossible.
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In SUNBROAD, the tenant could still operate a retail shop despite the pandemic. In the current case, the Hamilton Flyer has been destroyed, making it impossible for Luke to complete the restoration and for Peter to take the planned trip.
- **Legal Concept 3: Allocation of Risk**: The court examines whether the contract makes any provision for the unforeseen event.
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In SUNBROAD, the contract did not provide for a pandemic or social unrest. In the current case, the contract is silent on the issue of risk and damage.
- **Legal Concept 4: Financial Loss and Compensation**: The court considers whether any financial losses incurred due to the unforeseen event can be recovered.
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In SUNBROAD, the tenant sought a rent reduction due to financial losses. In the current case, Luke seeks to recover the £5,000 spent on restoration, and Peter seeks to recover the £100 paid for tickets.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of an unforeseen event making the performance of the contract impossible and the contract being silent on the allocation of risk, the court should decide that the contract is frustrated and discharge the parties from their obligations. This rule was justified in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD because the positive effects (E+) of outcome o on the underlying values and principles of the law, such as fairness and the reasonable expectations of the parties, outweigh the negative effects (E-) in that case. The court emphasized that the doctrine of frustration should not be lightly invoked but should apply when the unforeseen event fundamentally changes the nature of the contractual obligations. 

In the current case, the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer fundamentally changes the nature of the contractual obligations for both Luke and Peter, making it impossible for them to perform their respective contracts. Therefore, applying the rule from the precedent, the contracts should be discharged by frustration, and any monies paid or payable should be recoverable.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Doctrine of Frustration**: In both cases, the parties are arguing that unforeseen events have made the performance of the contract impossible or radically different from what was agreed upon.
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In SUNBROAD, the tenant argued that the COVID-19 pandemic and social unrest frustrated the lease. In the current case, Luke and Peter argue that the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer frustrates their contracts.

- **Legal Concept 2: Impossibility of Performance**: The argument hinges on whether the unforeseen event has made the performance of the contract impossible.
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In SUNBROAD, the tenant could still operate a retail shop despite the pandemic. In the current case, the Hamilton Flyer has been destroyed, making it impossible for Luke to complete the restoration and for Peter to take the planned trip.

- **Legal Concept 3: Allocation of Risk**: The court examines whether the contract makes any provision for the unforeseen event.
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In SUNBROAD, the contract did not provide for a pandemic or social unrest. In the current case, the contract is silent on the issue of risk and damage.

- **Legal Concept 4: Financial Loss and Compensation**: The court considers whether any financial losses incurred due to the unforeseen event can be recovered.
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In SUNBROAD, the tenant sought a rent reduction due to financial losses. In the current case, Luke seeks to recover the £5,000 spent on restoration, and Peter seeks to recover the £100 paid for tickets.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome: the contracts should be discharged by frustration. This decision would be justified because, as in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Fairness**: Discharging the contracts would be fair to both Luke and Peter, as the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer was an unforeseen event that fundamentally changed the nature of their contractual obligations. Holding them to the original terms would be unjust.

2. **Reasonable Expectations**: The parties could not have reasonably contemplated the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer at the time of entering into the contracts. Discharging the contracts aligns with the reasonable expectations of the parties.

3. **Legal Consistency**: Applying the doctrine of frustration consistently ensures that similar cases are treated similarly, promoting legal certainty and predictability.

4. **Mitigation of Loss**: Allowing Luke to recover the £5,000 spent on restoration and Peter to recover the £100 paid for tickets mitigates their financial losses, which were incurred through no fault of their own.

Therefore, the court should discharge the contracts by frustration and allow Luke and Peter to recover their respective financial losses.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the tenant could still operate a retail shop despite the COVID-19 pandemic and social unrest. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling (upholding the contract) outweighed any potential drawbacks because the tenant's ability to continue operating meant that the fundamental nature of the contract was not altered. However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as the Hamilton Flyer has been completely destroyed, making it impossible for Luke to complete the restoration and for Peter to take the planned trip. The destruction of the train fundamentally changes the nature of the contractual obligations, unlike in the precedent case where the tenant could still perform under the contract.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD**: the complete destruction of the subject matter of the contract (the Hamilton Flyer). This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it makes the performance of the contract impossible. Due to the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer, applying the same outcome (upholding the contract) in our case would have more negative consequences such as unjustly holding Luke and Peter to contracts they cannot possibly fulfill, unlike in **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD** where the tenant could still operate a retail shop. The complete destruction of the train means that the contracts should be discharged by frustration, allowing Luke and Peter to recover their respective financial losses.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD** should be stated as "When both [the shared fact pattern of an unforeseen event making the performance of the contract impossible and the contract being silent on the allocation of risk] and [the complete destruction of the subject matter of the contract] are present, the court should decide [that the contract is frustrated and discharge the parties from their obligations]." Omitting [the complete destruction of the subject matter of the contract] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of unjustly holding parties to contracts they cannot possibly fulfill, resulting in significant financial and emotional hardship]. Indeed, the opinion in **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD** explicitly states that [the tenant's ability to continue operating a retail shop despite the pandemic was crucial to their decision, as it did not fundamentally change the nature of the contractual obligations].

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties using minor disruptions as an excuse to escape contractual obligations, thereby undermining the stability and predictability of contractual relationships]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [parties using minor disruptions as an excuse, as the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer is a significant and fundamental change that makes the performance of the contracts impossible]. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of the tenant being able to continue operating a retail shop despite the pandemic, which was present in the precedent case SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD, requiring this factor for all similar cases of unforeseen events making the performance of the contract impossible would lead to the undesirable consequence of unjustly holding parties to contracts they cannot possibly fulfill. Conversely, not requiring the tenant's ability to continue operating would allow for a more just outcome, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, such as fairness and the reasonable expectations of the parties. This approach ensures that parties are not unfairly penalized for circumstances beyond their control that fundamentally alter the nature of their contractual obligations.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of the tenant being able to continue operating a retail shop despite the pandemic, which was present in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD, we have the additional factor of the complete destruction of the subject matter of the contract (the Hamilton Flyer). This complete destruction, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of an unforeseen event making the performance of the contract impossible, serves a similar function to the tenant's ability to continue operating in the precedent case. Given the presence of the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer, we submit that the reasoning in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as fairness and the reasonable expectations of the parties, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the invocation of the doctrine of frustration due to unforeseen events and the silence of the contract on the allocation of risk. However, it also differs significantly in that the subject matter of the contract (the Hamilton Flyer) has been completely destroyed, making performance impossible.

The proposed legal rule that "when an unforeseen event makes the performance of the contract impossible and the contract is silent on the allocation of risk, the court should decide that the contract is frustrated and discharge the parties from their obligations" finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, particularly the need to ensure fairness and the reasonable expectations of the parties.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point from the precedent case that the tenant could still operate a retail shop despite the pandemic, which was crucial in deciding that the contract was not frustrated. Conversely, in the current case, the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer fundamentally changes the nature of the contractual obligations, making performance impossible.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, reasonable expectations, and legal consistency, we conclude that the contracts between Luke, Peter, and the Yorkshire Dales Railway should be discharged by frustration. This decision aligns with the legal precedent while also serving justice by not holding parties to contracts they cannot possibly fulfill due to circumstances beyond their control.

Therefore, Luke should be able to recover the £5,000 spent on restoration, and Peter should be able to recover the £100 paid for tickets. The destruction of the Hamilton Flyer is a significant and fundamental change that justifies the application of the doctrine of frustration, discharging the parties from their contractual obligations and allowing for the recovery of financial losses incurred.

- The contract between Luke and the Yorkshire Dales Railway has become impossible of performance due to the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer.
- The parties have been discharged from further performance of the contract.
- Luke has spent £5,000 working on the train prior to its destruction.
- Luke was due to be paid £8,000 on completion of the work.
- Luke can recover the £5,000 spent as money received by the Yorkshire Dales Railway for his use.
- The £8,000 payable to Luke ceases to be payable.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3:
- Peter has paid £100 for tickets on the Hamilton Flyer.
- The contract has become impossible of performance due to the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer.

### Major Premise:

1. Vember Lord Ltd v. The Swatch Group (Hong Kong) Ltd [2023] HKCA 371

   Conditions:
   - There is a shared common purpose between the parties that is frustrated by a supervening event.
   - The supervening event thwarts the commonly held purposes by the parties when they entered into the contract.
   - The contractual obligations are rendered radically or fundamentally different from what was agreed upon in the contract.

   Consequences:
   - The contract may be discharged under the doctrine of frustration.

   Exceptions:
   - The primary obligation to lease has not been rendered impossible by the supervening event.
   - The supervening event does not affect the occupation or use of the premises as a discrete physical space.

### Minor Premise:

1. Luke's Contract:
   - There is a shared common purpose between Luke and the Yorkshire Dales Railway to restore the Hamilton Flyer.
   - The explosion, a supervening event, destroyed the Hamilton Flyer, thwarting the common purpose of restoring the train.
   - The contractual obligations (restoration of the Hamilton Flyer) are rendered radically different as the train no longer exists.
   - The primary obligation to restore the Hamilton Flyer has been rendered impossible by the supervening event.
   - The supervening event (explosion) does not involve the occupation or use of premises as a discrete physical space.

   Therefore, the contract between Luke and the Yorkshire Dales Railway may be discharged under the doctrine of frustration.

2. Peter's Contract:
   - There is a shared common purpose between Peter and the Yorkshire Dales Railway for Peter to experience a trip on the Hamilton Flyer.
   - The explosion, a supervening event, destroyed the Hamilton Flyer, thwarting the common purpose of experiencing a trip on the Hamilton Flyer.
   - The contractual obligations (providing a trip on the Hamilton Flyer) are rendered radically different as the Hamilton Flyer no longer exists.
   - The primary obligation to provide a trip on the Hamilton Flyer has been rendered impossible by the supervening event.
   - The supervening event (explosion) does not involve the occupation or use of premises as a discrete physical space.

   Therefore, the contract between Peter and the Yorkshire Dales Railway may be discharged under the doctrine of frustration.

### Conclusion:

The contracts between Luke and the Yorkshire Dales Railway, and Peter and the Yorkshire Dales Railway, may be discharged under the doctrine of frustration due to the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer by the explosion. Luke may recover the £5,000 spent on the restoration work, and Peter may recover the £100 paid for the tickets.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD)
In the case of SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD (precedent p), the court ruled that the tenant's claim of frustration due to the COVID-19 pandemic and social unrest did not raise a triable issue. The court found that the pandemic and social unrest did not fundamentally change the nature of the outstanding contractual rights and obligations from what the parties could reasonably have contemplated at the time of the execution of the Tenancy Agreement. Therefore, the contract was not discharged by frustration.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Doctrine of Frustration**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, an unforeseen event (COVID-19 pandemic in precedent p and the explosion in the current case) occurred after the formation of the contract, which was argued to have made the performance of the contract impossible or radically different from what was agreed upon.

- **Legal Concept 2: Impossibility of Performance**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In both cases, the unforeseen event led to a situation where the performance of the contract as originally intended became impossible (operation of a retail shop in precedent p and the operation of the Hamilton Flyer in the current case).

- **Legal Concept 3: Fundamental Change in Contractual Obligations**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: The court in precedent p examined whether the unforeseen event fundamentally changed the nature of the contractual obligations. Similarly, in the current case, we need to assess whether the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer fundamentally changes the nature of the contractual obligations to Luke and Peter.

- **Legal Concept 4: Recovery of Monies Paid**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In both cases, there is a question of whether any monies paid or payable under the contract can be recovered if the contract is found to be frustrated.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of an unforeseen event making the performance of the contract impossible or radically different from what was agreed upon, the court should decide whether the doctrine of frustration applies to discharge the contract. This rule was justified in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that contracts are only discharged in truly exceptional circumstances outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially holding parties to onerous obligations. The court emphasized that the doctrine of frustration should not be lightly invoked to relieve contracting parties of the normal consequences of imprudent commercial bargains or commercial risks.

Applying this rule to the current case:
- For Luke: The destruction of the Hamilton Flyer makes it impossible for him to complete the restoration work. Given that the contract is silent on the issue of risk and damage, and considering the precedent, the contract may be discharged by frustration. Luke may be able to recover the £5,000 spent on the work under the principle of restitution.
- For Peter: The destruction of the Hamilton Flyer makes it impossible for the Yorkshire Dales Railway to provide the specific experience he contracted for. The contract may be discharged by frustration, and Peter should be entitled to recover the £100 paid for the tickets.

Therefore, the doctrine of frustration would likely discharge both contracts with the Yorkshire Dales Railway, and the monies paid or payable could be recovered.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Doctrine of Frustration**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, an unforeseen event (COVID-19 pandemic in the precedent and the explosion in the current case) occurred after the formation of the contract, which was argued to have made the performance of the contract impossible or radically different from what was agreed upon.

- **Legal Concept 2: Impossibility of Performance**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In both cases, the unforeseen event led to a situation where the performance of the contract as originally intended became impossible (operation of a retail shop in the precedent and the operation of the Hamilton Flyer in the current case).

- **Legal Concept 3: Fundamental Change in Contractual Obligations**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: The court in the precedent examined whether the unforeseen event fundamentally changed the nature of the contractual obligations. Similarly, in the current case, we need to assess whether the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer fundamentally changes the nature of the contractual obligations to Luke and Peter.

- **Legal Concept 4: Recovery of Monies Paid**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In both cases, there is a question of whether any monies paid or payable under the contract can be recovered if the contract is found to be frustrated.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Fairness and Justice**: The doctrine of frustration is designed to prevent injustice where an unforeseen event makes the performance of the contract impossible or radically different from what was agreed upon. Applying this doctrine in the current case would ensure that neither Luke nor Peter is unfairly held to a contract that cannot be performed due to circumstances beyond their control.

2. **Encouraging Clear Contractual Terms**: By discharging the contracts due to frustration, the court reinforces the importance of including clear terms regarding risk and damage in contracts. This encourages parties to anticipate and address potential unforeseen events in their agreements, promoting better contractual practices.

3. **Maintaining Commercial Certainty**: The decision would uphold the principle that contracts should only be discharged in truly exceptional circumstances, thereby maintaining commercial certainty. Parties can rely on the fact that contracts will generally be enforced unless an unforeseen event fundamentally changes the nature of the contractual obligations.

4. **Promoting Restitution**: Allowing Luke to recover the £5,000 spent on the work and Peter to recover the £100 paid for the tickets aligns with the principle of restitution. It ensures that parties are not left out of pocket for expenses incurred in reliance on a contract that can no longer be performed.

Therefore, the doctrine of frustration would likely discharge both contracts with the Yorkshire Dales Railway, and the monies paid or payable could be recovered. This decision would be justified because it would ensure fairness, encourage clear contractual terms, maintain commercial certainty, and promote restitution, just as in the precedent case.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the tenant's business could still operate in some capacity despite the unforeseen events (COVID-19 pandemic and social unrest). This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling (maintaining the contract) outweighed any potential drawbacks because the tenant was not entirely prevented from fulfilling its contractual obligations, and the nature of the contract was not fundamentally altered.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as the Hamilton Flyer was completely destroyed in an explosion, making it impossible for Luke to complete the restoration work and for Peter to experience the Hamilton Flyer as intended. The destruction of the train fundamentally changes the nature of the contractual obligations, as the specific subject matter of the contract no longer exists.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD. This factor is the complete destruction of the subject matter of the contract (the Hamilton Flyer). This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because, unlike in the precedent case where the tenant's business could still operate, the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer makes it physically and commercially impossible for both Luke and Peter to fulfill their respective contracts.

Due to the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer, applying the same outcome (not discharging the contract) in our case would have more negative consequences such as unfairly holding Luke and Peter to contracts that cannot be performed due to circumstances beyond their control. Unlike in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD, where the tenant could still operate its business, the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer leaves no room for performance, making the doctrine of frustration more applicable in this scenario.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD should be stated as "When both [an unforeseen event making the performance of the contract impossible or radically different from what was agreed upon] and [the complete destruction of the subject matter of the contract] are present, the court should decide [that the contract is discharged by frustration]." Omitting [the complete destruction of the subject matter of the contract] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of unfairly holding parties to contracts that cannot be performed due to circumstances beyond their control]. Indeed, the opinion in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD explicitly states that the tenant's business could still operate in some capacity despite the unforeseen events, which was crucial to their decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties using the doctrine of frustration to escape from contracts that have become merely more onerous or less profitable, rather than truly impossible to perform]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [parties using the doctrine of frustration to escape from merely onerous contracts] occurring. The complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer makes it physically and commercially impossible for both Luke and Peter to fulfill their respective contracts. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of the tenant's business being able to operate in some capacity despite the unforeseen events, which was present in the precedent case SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD, requiring this factor for all similar cases of unforeseen events making the performance of the contract impossible or radically different from what was agreed upon would lead to the undesirable consequence of unfairly holding parties to contracts that cannot be performed due to circumstances beyond their control. Conversely, not requiring the ability to operate in some capacity would allow for a more just and equitable outcome, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, such as fairness and the prevention of unjust enrichment.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of the tenant's business being able to operate in some capacity, which was present in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD, we have the additional factor of the complete destruction of the subject matter of the contract (the Hamilton Flyer). This complete destruction, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of an unforeseen event making the performance of the contract impossible or radically different from what was agreed upon, serves a similar function to the tenant's ability to operate in some capacity in the precedent case. Given the presence of the complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer, we submit that the reasoning in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as fairness, justice, and the prevention of unjust enrichment would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of an unforeseen event making the performance of the contract impossible or radically different from what was agreed upon. However, it also differs significantly in that the subject matter of the contract (the Hamilton Flyer) was completely destroyed, making performance physically and commercially impossible.

The proposed legal rule that when both an unforeseen event and the complete destruction of the subject matter of the contract are present, the court should decide that the contract is discharged by frustration, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of maintaining commercial certainty and the need to ensure fairness and justice in contractual relationships.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, justice, and the prevention of unjust enrichment, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the doctrine of frustration should apply to discharge both contracts with the Yorkshire Dales Railway. The complete destruction of the Hamilton Flyer fundamentally changes the nature of the contractual obligations, making it impossible for Luke to complete the restoration work and for Peter to experience the Hamilton Flyer as intended.

Therefore, Luke should be able to recover the £5,000 spent on the work under the principle of restitution, and Peter should be entitled to recover the £100 paid for the tickets. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency, ensuring that parties are not unfairly held to contracts that cannot be performed due to circumstances beyond their control.

### Minor Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 1 and 2:
   - Luke's contract to restore the Hamilton Flyer has become impossible of performance due to the train's destruction.
   - The parties (Luke and Yorkshire Dales Railway) have been discharged from further performance of the contract.
   - Luke has spent £5,000 working on the train prior to its destruction.
   - Luke was due to be paid £8,000 on completion of the work.
   - Therefore, Luke can recover the £5,000 spent as money received by the Yorkshire Dales Railway for his use.
   - The £8,000 payable to Luke ceases to be payable.
   - However, the court may allow Luke to retain or recover the whole or any part of the sums paid or payable, not exceeding the expenses incurred (£5,000).

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3:
   - Peter has paid £100 for tickets on the Hamilton Flyer.

### Conclusion:

The doctrine of frustration would discharge Luke's and Peter's contracts with the Yorkshire Dales Railway. Luke can recover the £5,000 spent on the restoration work, and the £8,000 payable to him ceases to be payable. Peter can recover the £100 paid for the tickets.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA2450/2004 BETWEEN NG CHUN KONG CALVIN trading as KO AND CO. Plaintiff and FIRST STAR DEVELOPMENT LIMITED Defendant)
In the case of HCA2450/2004 BETWEEN NG CHUN KONG CALVIN trading as KO AND CO. Plaintiff and FIRST STAR DEVELOPMENT LIMITED Defendant (precedent p), the plaintiff, a solicitor, entered into a contract with the defendant to provide legal services for the sale of flats under the Private Sector Participation Scheme (PSPS). The PSPS was later discontinued by the Hong Kong Government, making it impossible for the contract to be performed as originally anticipated. The court ruled that the contract was frustrated due to the discontinuation of the PSPS, which was a fundamental change in circumstances. Consequently, the contract was discharged, and the plaintiff was entitled to recover his fees on a quantum meruit basis.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA2450/2004 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Doctrine of Frustration**: In both cases, an unforeseen event occurred that fundamentally changed the nature of the contractual obligations.
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA2450/2004, the discontinuation of the PSPS scheme made it impossible to perform the contract as originally intended. In the current case, the explosion destroyed the Hamilton Flyer, making it impossible for Luke to complete his work and for Peter to experience the train ride as planned.
- **Legal Concept 2: Discharge of Contract**: The contracts in both cases were discharged due to frustration.
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA2450/2004, the contract was discharged because the PSPS scheme was discontinued. In the current case, the contract should be discharged because the Hamilton Flyer was destroyed.
- **Legal Concept 3: Recovery of Monies Paid or Payable**: The parties in both cases sought to recover monies paid or payable under the frustrated contract.
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA2450/2004, the plaintiff was entitled to recover fees on a quantum meruit basis. In the current case, Luke and Peter seek to recover the amounts they have paid or are owed.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA2450/2004)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of an unforeseen event fundamentally changing the nature of the contractual obligations (i*), the court should decide that the contract is frustrated and discharge the parties from further liability (outcome o). This rule was justified in HCA2450/2004 because the positive effects (E+) of outcome o on the underlying values and principles of the law, such as fairness and justice, outweigh the negative effects (E-) in that case. The court recognized that it would be unjust to hold the parties to a contract that had become impossible to perform due to circumstances beyond their control.

Applying this rule to the current case:
- **Luke**: The destruction of the Hamilton Flyer fundamentally changes the nature of his contractual obligations, making it impossible for him to complete the work. Therefore, the contract should be discharged due to frustration, and Luke should be entitled to recover the £5,000 he has spent on a quantum meruit basis.
- **Peter**: The destruction of the Hamilton Flyer makes it impossible for him to experience the train ride as planned. Therefore, the contract should be discharged due to frustration, and Peter should be entitled to recover the £100 he paid for the tickets.

In conclusion, both Luke and Peter should be able to rely on the doctrine of frustration to discharge their contracts with the Yorkshire Dales Railway and recover the monies paid or payable.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA2450/2004 BETWEEN NG CHUN KONG CALVIN trading as KO AND CO. Plaintiff and FIRST STAR DEVELOPMENT LIMITED Defendant) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Doctrine of Frustration**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA2450/2004, the discontinuation of the PSPS scheme made it impossible to perform the contract as originally intended. In the current case, the explosion destroyed the Hamilton Flyer, making it impossible for Luke to complete his work and for Peter to experience the train ride as planned.

- **Legal Concept 2: Discharge of Contract**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA2450/2004, the contract was discharged because the PSPS scheme was discontinued. In the current case, the contract should be discharged because the Hamilton Flyer was destroyed.

- **Legal Concept 3: Recovery of Monies Paid or Payable**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA2450/2004, the plaintiff was entitled to recover fees on a quantum meruit basis. In the current case, Luke and Peter seek to recover the amounts they have paid or are owed.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome: the contracts should be discharged due to frustration, and the parties should be entitled to recover the monies paid or payable.

This decision would be justified because, as in HCA2450/2004, it would have the following positive effects on the underlying values and principles of the law:

1. **Fairness and Justice**: Holding Luke and Peter to their contracts despite the unforeseen destruction of the Hamilton Flyer would be unjust. The doctrine of frustration exists to prevent such unfair outcomes by discharging parties from their contractual obligations when performance becomes impossible due to circumstances beyond their control.

2. **Mitigation of Losses**: Allowing Luke to recover the £5,000 he has spent on a quantum meruit basis ensures that he is not unfairly burdened by the costs incurred due to the frustrated contract. Similarly, allowing Peter to recover the £100 he paid for the tickets ensures that he is not financially disadvantaged by the inability to experience the train ride as planned.

3. **Encouragement of Good Faith**: By discharging the contracts and allowing for the recovery of monies paid or payable, the court promotes the principle of good faith in contractual relationships. Parties are more likely to enter into contracts with confidence, knowing that they will not be unfairly penalized for events beyond their control.

In conclusion, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA2450/2004, it would have the positive effects of promoting fairness, justice, and good faith in contractual relationships.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA2450/2004 BETWEEN NG CHUN KONG CALVIN trading as KO AND CO. Plaintiff and FIRST STAR DEVELOPMENT LIMITED Defendant, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the contract was directly tied to a government scheme (PSPS) that was discontinued. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling (fairness and justice in discharging the contract) outweighed any potential drawbacks because the discontinuation of the PSPS scheme was a fundamental change in circumstances that made the performance of the contract impossible.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of a government scheme being discontinued is notably absent. The destruction of the Hamilton Flyer was due to an unforeseen explosion, not a change in government policy or scheme. This means that while the destruction of the train is an unforeseen event, it does not carry the same weight of a fundamental policy change that directly impacts the contractual obligations.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in HCA2450/2004 BETWEEN NG CHUN KONG CALVIN trading as KO AND CO. Plaintiff and FIRST STAR DEVELOPMENT LIMITED Defendant. This factor is the replacement of the Hamilton Flyer with the Selby Miner. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the replacement train, although different, still provides a means for the railway service to continue, albeit in a modified form.

Due to the presence of the Selby Miner, applying the same outcome (discharge of the contract due to frustration) in our case would have more negative consequences such as denying the possibility of fulfilling the contractual obligations in an alternative manner. Unlike in HCA2450/2004, where the discontinuation of the PSPS scheme left no room for alternative performance, the availability of the Selby Miner suggests that the railway service can still be provided, albeit not in the exact manner originally anticipated. This means that the contracts may not be entirely frustrated, and alternative performance could be considered, which would mitigate the negative consequences of a complete discharge.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from HCA2450/2004 BETWEEN NG CHUN KONG CALVIN trading as KO AND CO. Plaintiff and FIRST STAR DEVELOPMENT LIMITED Defendant should be stated as: "When both [an unforeseen event fundamentally changing the nature of the contractual obligations] and [the absence of any alternative means to fulfill the contract] are present, the court should decide [to discharge the contract due to frustration]." Omitting [the absence of any alternative means to fulfill the contract] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of discharging contracts even when alternative performance is possible, thereby causing unnecessary financial and operational disruptions]. Indeed, the opinion in HCA2450/2004 explicitly states that the discontinuation of the PSPS scheme was crucial to their decision, as it left no room for alternative performance.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in HCA2450/2004 was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of holding parties to contracts that have become impossible to perform due to fundamental changes in circumstances]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [this undesirable consequence] occurring because the availability of the Selby Miner provides an alternative means to fulfill the contractual obligations. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The presence of an alternative train (the Selby Miner) means that the contractual obligations can still be performed, albeit in a modified form, thus avoiding the need to discharge the contracts entirely.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of a government scheme being discontinued, which was present in the precedent case HCA2450/2004 BETWEEN NG CHUN KONG CALVIN trading as KO AND CO. Plaintiff and FIRST STAR DEVELOPMENT LIMITED Defendant, requiring this factor for all similar cases of unforeseen events fundamentally changing the nature of the contractual obligations would lead to the undesirable consequence of limiting the application of the doctrine of frustration to only those cases involving government schemes. Conversely, not requiring the presence of a government scheme would allow for a broader and more equitable application of the doctrine of frustration, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and justice in contract law. This would ensure that parties are not unfairly held to contracts that have become impossible to perform due to unforeseen events, regardless of whether a government scheme is involved.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of a government scheme being discontinued, which was present in HCA2450/2004, we have the additional factor of the replacement of the Hamilton Flyer with the Selby Miner. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of an unforeseen event fundamentally changing the nature of the contractual obligations, serves a similar function to the government scheme in the precedent case. Given the presence of the Selby Miner as an alternative means to fulfill the contractual obligations, we submit that the reasoning in HCA2450/2004 still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as fairness, justice, and the encouragement of good faith in contractual relationships, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. The availability of the Selby Miner ensures that the contractual obligations can still be performed, albeit in a modified form, thereby mitigating the need for a complete discharge of the contracts.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA2450/2004 BETWEEN NG CHUN KONG CALVIN trading as KO AND CO. Plaintiff and FIRST STAR DEVELOPMENT LIMITED Defendant, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the unforeseen event fundamentally changing the nature of the contractual obligations and the need to consider the doctrine of frustration. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of a government scheme being discontinued and the presence of an alternative means to fulfill the contractual obligations (the Selby Miner).

The proposed legal rule of discharging the contract due to frustration when an unforeseen event fundamentally changes the nature of the contractual obligations finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the availability of an alternative means to fulfill the contract in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the doctrine of frustration should apply to prevent unfair outcomes (as argued in the initial analogy) and the counterargument that the availability of the Selby Miner provides an alternative means to fulfill the contractual obligations, thus mitigating the need for a complete discharge of the contracts.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, justice, and the encouragement of good faith in contractual relationships, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the contracts should not be entirely discharged due to frustration. Instead, the parties should explore the possibility of fulfilling the contractual obligations using the Selby Miner. This approach balances the need to prevent unfair outcomes with the practical consideration of alternative performance.

Therefore, Luke should be entitled to recover the £5,000 he has spent on a quantum meruit basis, as the work he performed on the Hamilton Flyer cannot be transferred to the Selby Miner. However, Peter should be offered the opportunity to transfer his booking to the Selby Miner or receive a refund of the £100 he paid for the tickets if he chooses not to proceed with the alternative arrangement.

This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency, ensuring that parties are not unfairly held to contracts that have become impossible to perform due to unforeseen events, but also recognizing the practicalities of alternative performance where available.
