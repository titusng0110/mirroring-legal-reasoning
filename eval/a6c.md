### Legal Analysis of the Scenario

#### Legal Issues
1. **Frustration of Contract**: Whether the contracts between Luke and the Yorkshire Dales Railway (YDR), and Peter and YDR, are frustrated due to the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer.
2. **Recovery of Monies Paid or Payable**: Whether Luke can recover the £5,000 he spent on the train and whether Peter can recover the £100 he paid for the tickets.

#### Applicable Laws
1. **Doctrine of Frustration**: Under common law, a contract may be discharged if an unforeseen event renders contractual obligations impossible, illegal, or radically different from what was contemplated by the parties.
2. **Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943**: This UK legislation, which is likely to be persuasive in Hong Kong due to the common law system, deals with the consequences of frustration, including the recovery of monies paid or payable.

#### Application of Law to Facts

##### Luke's Contract with YDR

1. **Frustration of Contract**:
   - **Impossibility of Performance**: The destruction of the Hamilton Flyer makes it impossible for Luke to complete the restoration work. This unforeseen event fundamentally changes the nature of the contract.
   - **Case Law**: In *Taylor v Caldwell* (1863), the destruction of a music hall discharged the contract due to impossibility. Similarly, the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer would likely frustrate Luke's contract.

2. **Recovery of Monies**:
   - **Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943**:
     - **Section 1(2)**: Allows for the recovery of sums paid before the frustrating event and provides for a just sum to be paid for any valuable benefit conferred before the event.
     - **Application**: Luke has spent £5,000 on the restoration. Under Section 1(2), he may be entitled to recover this amount as it represents a valuable benefit conferred before the frustration. However, since he was due to be paid £8,000 on completion, the court may need to determine a just sum considering the partial performance.

##### Peter's Contract with YDR

1. **Frustration of Contract**:
   - **Impossibility of Performance**: The specific performance of riding the Hamilton Flyer, including the unique experience of riding in the driver’s seat, is impossible due to the train's destruction.
   - **Case Law**: In *Krell v Henry* (1903), the contract was frustrated because the purpose of hiring a room to view the coronation procession was defeated when the procession was cancelled. Similarly, Peter's contract is frustrated as the primary purpose (riding the Hamilton Flyer) cannot be fulfilled.

2. **Recovery of Monies**:
   - **Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943**:
     - **Section 1(2)**: Peter can recover the £100 paid for the tickets as the contract is frustrated and the purpose of the contract cannot be achieved.
     - **Application**: Since the contract is frustrated, Peter is entitled to recover the £100 he paid in advance.

### Conclusion

- **Luke**: The contract between Luke and YDR is frustrated due to the destruction of the Hamilton Flyer. Luke can potentially recover the £5,000 spent on the restoration under the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943, Section 1(2), as it represents a valuable benefit conferred before the frustration.
- **Peter**: The contract between Peter and YDR is frustrated as the primary purpose of the contract cannot be fulfilled. Peter is entitled to recover the £100 paid for the tickets under the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943, Section 1(2).

Both parties should seek legal advice to pursue their claims for recovery of monies paid or payable.
