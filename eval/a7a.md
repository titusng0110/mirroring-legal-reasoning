# Contract Law: Whether M-Scan Ltd can unilaterally reduce the donation percentage to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 6 and Section 7

### Major Premise:

1. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 6

   Conditions:
   - A third party may enforce a term of a contract under section 4.
   - The third party has assented to the term and the promisor has received notice of the assent; or
   - The third party has relied on the term and the promisor is aware of the reliance or can reasonably be expected to have foreseen that the third party would rely on the term.

   Consequences:
   - The parties to the contract may not, without the third party’s consent, rescind the contract or vary the contract so that the third party’s right under the term is altered or extinguished.

   Exceptions:
   - An express term of the contract provides that one or more parties to the contract may rescind or vary the contract without the third party’s consent; or
   - The third party’s consent to rescind or vary the contract is required in circumstances specified in the contract instead of those set out in subsection (2)(a) and (b); and
   - Before the circumstances set out in subsection (2)(a) or (b) occur, the third party is aware of the term referred to in subsection (3) or one or more parties to the contract have taken reasonable steps to make the third party aware of the term.

2. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 7

   Conditions:
   - A third party’s consent is required to rescind or vary a contract under section 6(1) or (3)(b).
   - A party to the contract applies to the court to make an order dispensing with the third party’s consent.

   Consequences:
   - The court may make the order if the other party or each other party to the contract agrees to rescind or vary the contract.
   - The court thinks it just and practicable to make the order.
   - The order may be made subject to any condition that the court thinks fit, including a condition requiring that the third party be compensated.

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 6:
- The Albright Cancer Research Foundation is a third party that may enforce the term of the contract under section 4.
- The Foundation has relied on the term, and M-Scan Ltd is aware of the reliance or can reasonably be expected to have foreseen that the Foundation would rely on the term.
- M-Scan Ltd has given notice to existing customers that the donation will cease and the annual donation will drop from 10 per cent to 5 per cent.
- The existing customer base is happy with the new arrangements, but the Foundation has not consented to this change.
- There is no express term in the contract that allows M-Scan Ltd to rescind or vary the contract without the Foundation’s consent.
- Therefore, M-Scan Ltd cannot unilaterally reduce the donation percentage without the Foundation’s consent.

2. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 7:
- The Foundation’s consent is required to rescind or vary the contract under section 6(1).
- M-Scan Ltd has not applied to the court to make an order dispensing with the Foundation’s consent.
- Even if M-Scan Ltd were to apply, the court would need to consider whether it is just and practicable to make the order and may impose conditions, including compensation to the Foundation.

### Conclusion:

Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 6 applies, and M-Scan Ltd cannot unilaterally reduce the donation percentage to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation without the Foundation’s consent. If M-Scan Ltd wishes to proceed with the change, they must either obtain the Foundation’s consent or apply to the court under Section 7, where the court may impose conditions, including compensation to the Foundation.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA 1288/2010)
In the case of HCA 1288/2010 BETWEEN LEUNG WAN KEE SHIPYARD LIMITED Plaintiff and DRAGON PEARL NIGHT CLUB RESTAURANT LIMITED 1st Defendant CHAN SIU TUNG 2nd Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to the claimed survey fees of $390,335 and compound interest on the amounts due, as the terms of the contract were clear and the defendants' arguments were inconsistent and unsupported by credible evidence.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA 1288/2010 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Contractual Obligations and Terms**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA 1288/2010, the court found that the terms of the contract, including the payment of survey fees, were clear and enforceable. Similarly, in the current case, the terms of the contract between M-Scan Ltd and its customers, including the donation to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation, are clear and enforceable.
- **Legal Concept 2: Unilateral Changes to Contract Terms**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA 1288/2010, the court rejected the defendants' attempt to avoid liability based on unsubstantiated claims and changes to the agreed terms. In the current case, M-Scan Ltd is attempting to unilaterally reduce the donation percentage, which is a change to the agreed terms of the contract.
- **Legal Concept 3: Credibility and Consistency of Evidence**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA 1288/2010, the court found the defendants' evidence to be inconsistent and self-contradictory. In the current case, the Albright Cancer Research Foundation can argue that M-Scan Ltd's unilateral change is not supported by any credible evidence or mutual agreement.
- **Legal Concept 4: Enforceability of Exclusion Clauses**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCA 1288/2010, the court upheld the enforceability of the contract terms, including the interest clause. In the current case, Care 2 U Ltd can rely on the exclusion clause in the contract, provided the conditions for its applicability are met.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA 1288/2010)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a clear and enforceable contractual term (fact pattern i*), the court should decide in favor of upholding the contractual obligations (outcome o). This rule was justified in HCA 1288/2010 because the positive effects (E+) of enforcing clear contractual terms and maintaining the integrity of contractual agreements outweigh the negative effects (E-) of allowing parties to unilaterally alter agreed terms without mutual consent.

In the current case, the Albright Cancer Research Foundation can argue that M-Scan Ltd cannot unilaterally reduce the donation percentage as it is a clear term of the contract, and such a change would undermine the integrity of the contractual agreement. Similarly, Care 2 U Ltd can rely on the exclusion clause, provided Vulcanicity Ltd did not meet the conditions required to negate the clause, thus upholding the enforceability of the contract terms.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA 1288/2010) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Contractual Obligations and Terms**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA 1288/2010, the court found that the terms of the contract, including the payment of survey fees, were clear and enforceable. Similarly, in the current case, the terms of the contract between M-Scan Ltd and its customers, including the donation to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation, are clear and enforceable. The contract explicitly states that 10 per cent of the annual fee and 1 per cent of each booking will be donated to the Foundation.

- **Legal Concept 2: Unilateral Changes to Contract Terms**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA 1288/2010, the court rejected the defendants' attempt to avoid liability based on unsubstantiated claims and changes to the agreed terms. In the current case, M-Scan Ltd is attempting to unilaterally reduce the donation percentage, which is a change to the agreed terms of the contract. The Albright Cancer Research Foundation can argue that such a unilateral change is not permissible without mutual consent.

- **Legal Concept 3: Credibility and Consistency of Evidence**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA 1288/2010, the court found the defendants' evidence to be inconsistent and self-contradictory. In the current case, the Albright Cancer Research Foundation can argue that M-Scan Ltd's unilateral change is not supported by any credible evidence or mutual agreement. The Foundation has relied on the promised cash flow for its projects, and M-Scan Ltd's sudden change undermines this reliance.

- **Legal Concept 4: Enforceability of Exclusion Clauses**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCA 1288/2010, the court upheld the enforceability of the contract terms, including the interest clause. In the current case, Care 2 U Ltd can rely on the exclusion clause in the contract, provided the conditions for its applicability are met. Vulcanicity Ltd failed to undertake the recommended systems check, which is a condition precedent for the exclusion clause to be inapplicable.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCA 1288/2010. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA 1288/2010, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Contractual Integrity**: Enforcing the clear terms of the contract between M-Scan Ltd and the Albright Cancer Research Foundation ensures that parties cannot unilaterally alter agreed terms, thereby maintaining the integrity of contractual agreements.
2. **Reliance and Expectation**: The Albright Cancer Research Foundation has relied on the promised donations for its funding and projects. Allowing M-Scan Ltd to unilaterally reduce the donation percentage would undermine the Foundation's reliance and expectations, leading to potential financial harm.
3. **Consistency and Credibility**: Just as the court in HCA 1288/2010 found the defendants' evidence inconsistent and self-contradictory, the court should similarly find M-Scan Ltd's unilateral change unsupported by credible evidence or mutual agreement.
4. **Enforceability of Exclusion Clauses**: Care 2 U Ltd can rely on the exclusion clause, provided the conditions for its applicability are met. Vulcanicity Ltd's failure to undertake the systems check means the exclusion clause should be enforceable, protecting Care 2 U Ltd from liability for damages during transportation.

Therefore, the court should uphold the contractual obligations of M-Scan Ltd to maintain the original donation percentages and enforce the exclusion clause in favor of Care 2 U Ltd, ensuring consistency with the principles established in HCA 1288/2010.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the specific charitable donation clause, that was not present in HCA 1288/2010. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of clear and enforceable contractual terms. In HCA 1288/2010, the court dealt with a straightforward commercial contract without any charitable obligations. However, in our current case, the contractual obligation includes a specific charitable donation to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation, which has relied on this promised cash flow for its projects.

Due to this charitable donation clause, applying the same outcome as in HCA 1288/2010 would have more negative consequences, such as severe funding implications for the Albright Cancer Research Foundation, than positive ones. Unlike in HCA 1288/2010, where the enforcement of contractual terms primarily affected the commercial interests of the parties involved, the reduction of the donation percentage in our current case would directly impact the funding and operations of a charitable organization, which has broader social implications. Therefore, the presence of this charitable donation clause necessitates a different consideration and potentially a different outcome to balance the interests of all parties involved.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from HCA 1288/2010 should be stated as: "When both [i*] (clear and enforceable contractual terms) and [m] (the presence of a specific charitable donation clause) are present, the court should decide [o] (upholding the original contractual obligations without unilateral changes)." Omitting [m] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q] (severe funding implications for the charitable organization, which has relied on the promised cash flow for its projects). Indeed, the opinion in HCA 1288/2010 explicitly states that the enforceability of clear contractual terms was crucial to their decision, and the same principle should apply here, with the added consideration of the charitable donation clause.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in HCA 1288/2010 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of parties unilaterally altering agreed contractual terms, thereby undermining the integrity of contractual agreements. However, in our current case, there's an additional risk of severe funding implications for the Albright Cancer Research Foundation, which has relied on the promised donations for its projects. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule without considering the charitable donation clause would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves (preventing unilateral changes to contractual terms) is not fully relevant to our situation without addressing the broader social implications of the charitable donation. Thus, the court should uphold the original donation percentages to prevent the undesirable consequence of undermining the Foundation's funding and projects.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the specific charitable donation clause (factor m), which was present in the precedent case HCA 1288/2010, requiring this factor for all similar cases of clear and enforceable contractual terms (fact pattern i*) would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would allow parties to unilaterally alter agreed terms without mutual consent, undermining the integrity of contractual agreements. Conversely, not requiring the specific charitable donation clause would allow for the enforcement of clear contractual obligations, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, such as the sanctity of contracts and the expectation that parties will adhere to their agreed terms.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the specific charitable donation clause (factor m), which was present in HCA 1288/2010, we have the additional factor of the reliance by the Albright Cancer Research Foundation on the promised donations (factor n). This reliance, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of clear and enforceable contractual terms (i*), serves a similar function to the specific charitable donation clause in the precedent case. Given the presence of this reliance, we submit that the reasoning in HCA 1288/2010 still applies, as the positive effects on maintaining the integrity of contractual agreements and protecting the reliance interests of the Foundation would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA 1288/2010, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of clear and enforceable contractual terms and the issue of unilateral changes to those terms. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the inclusion of a specific charitable donation clause and the reliance of the Albright Cancer Research Foundation on the promised donations.

The proposed legal rule of upholding clear and enforceable contractual obligations finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of maintaining the integrity of contractual agreements and the potential severe funding implications for the Albright Cancer Research Foundation.

Considering the underlying legal principles of contract law, such as the sanctity of contracts and the expectation that parties will adhere to their agreed terms, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that M-Scan Ltd cannot unilaterally reduce the donation percentage to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation. This decision aligns with the precedent set in HCA 1288/2010, emphasizing the enforceability of clear contractual terms and protecting the reliance interests of the Foundation.

Regarding Care 2 U Ltd, the exclusion clause in the contract between Vulcanicity Ltd and M-Scan Ltd is enforceable, provided the conditions for its applicability are met. Vulcanicity Ltd's failure to undertake the recommended systems check means the exclusion clause should be enforceable, protecting Care 2 U Ltd from liability for damages during transportation.

In conclusion, M-Scan Ltd must adhere to the original donation percentages as stipulated in the contract, and Care 2 U Ltd can rely on the exclusion clause to avoid liability for the damages claimed by Vulcanicity Ltd. This decision ensures consistency with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency.


# Contract Law: Whether the reduction in the donation percentage constitutes a breach of contract between M-Scan Ltd and the Albright Cancer Research Foundation

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 6 Subsections 1, 2, and 3

### Major Premise:

1. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 6 Subsections 1, 2, and 3

   Conditions:
   - A third party may enforce a term of a contract under section 4.
   - The third party has assented to the term and the promisor has received notice of the assent; or
   - The third party has relied on the term and the promisor is aware of the reliance or can reasonably be expected to have foreseen that the third party would rely on the term.

   Consequences:
   - The parties to the contract may not, without the third party’s consent, rescind the contract or vary the contract so that the third party’s right under the term is altered or extinguished.

   Exceptions:
   - An express term of the contract provides that one or more parties to the contract may rescind or vary the contract without the third party’s consent; or
   - The third party’s consent to rescind or vary the contract is required in circumstances specified in the contract instead of those set out in subsection (2)(a) and (b).

### Minor Premise:

1. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 6 Subsections 1, 2, and 3:
   - The Albright Cancer Research Foundation is a third party that may enforce the term of the contract under section 4, as they are the intended beneficiary of the donation clause.
   - The Foundation has relied on the term, as evidenced by their allocation of funds to projects based on the promised cash flow.
   - M-Scan Ltd is aware of the reliance or can reasonably be expected to have foreseen that the Foundation would rely on the term, given the nature of the donation clause.

   Consequences:
   - M-Scan Ltd and its customers may not, without the Foundation’s consent, rescind the contract or vary the contract so that the Foundation’s right under the term is altered or extinguished.

   Exceptions:
   - There is no express term in the contract that provides M-Scan Ltd or its customers may rescind or vary the contract without the Foundation’s consent.
   - The contract does not specify any alternative circumstances under which the Foundation’s consent to rescind or vary the contract is required.

### Conclusion:

Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 6 Subsections 1, 2, and 3 apply, and M-Scan Ltd may not, without the Albright Cancer Research Foundation’s consent, rescind or vary the contract so that the Foundation’s right to the promised donations is altered or extinguished. Therefore, the Albright Cancer Research Foundation can claim the promised revenue from M-Scan Ltd.


# Contract Law: Whether the Albright Cancer Research Foundation can claim damages for the reduction in the promised donation

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 13A Subsection 1

### Major Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 13A Subsection 1

   Conditions:
   - A court is considering awarding damages for breach of a contract.
   - There has been part performance of the contract.
   - An order for specific performance could not be made by the court in the circumstances of the case.

   Consequences:
   - The court may award damages for the breach of the contract.

   Exceptions:
   - The contract was made before 31 December 1972.

### Minor Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 13A Subsection 1:
- The Albright Cancer Research Foundation is seeking damages for the reduction in the promised donation, which constitutes a breach of contract by M-Scan Ltd.
- There has been part performance of the contract, as M-Scan Ltd has been making donations to the Foundation up until the recent change.
- An order for specific performance (i.e., requiring M-Scan Ltd to continue making the original donations) could not be made by the court in the circumstances of the case, as the court typically does not enforce specific performance for ongoing monetary obligations.
- The contract between M-Scan Ltd and the Albright Cancer Research Foundation was made after 31 December 1972.

### Conclusion:

Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 13A Subsection 1 applies, and the court may award damages to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation for the breach of contract by M-Scan Ltd.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (DICKSON VALORA GROUP (HOLDINGS) CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. FAN JI QIAN)

In the case of DICKSON VALORA GROUP (HOLDINGS) CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. FAN JI QIAN (precedent p), the court dealt with the issue of whether an arbitration clause in a shareholders agreement was incorporated into a subsequent addendum and whether an anti-suit injunction should be granted to restrain a party from pursuing proceedings in a non-contractual forum. The court ruled that the arbitration clause was indeed incorporated into the addendum and granted the anti-suit injunction, emphasizing that a party seeking to enforce a right derived from a contract containing an arbitration clause must do so in accordance with the arbitration clause.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in DICKSON VALORA GROUP (HOLDINGS) CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. FAN JI QIAN and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Privity of Contract and Third-Party Rights**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In the precedent case, Fan was not a party to the Shareholders Agreement or the 3rd Addendum but sought to enforce rights derived from these contracts. Similarly, in the current case, the Albright Cancer Research Foundation is not a direct party to the contracts between M-Scan Ltd and its customers but seeks to enforce the promised donations.

- **Legal Concept 2: Incorporation of Contractual Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** The court in the precedent case examined whether the arbitration clause in the Shareholders Agreement was incorporated into the 3rd Addendum. In the current case, we need to determine whether the exclusion clause in the contract between M-Scan Ltd and its customers applies to Care 2 U Ltd.

- **Legal Concept 3: Equitable Remedies and Anti-Suit Injunctions**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** The court in the precedent case granted an anti-suit injunction to prevent Fan from pursuing proceedings in a non-contractual forum. In the current case, the Albright Cancer Research Foundation may seek an equitable remedy to enforce the promised donations.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (DICKSON VALORA GROUP (HOLDINGS) CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. FAN JI QIAN)

This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern where a third party seeks to enforce rights derived from a contract, the court should decide that the third party must adhere to the terms and conditions of the original contract, including any incorporated clauses. This rule was justified in DICKSON VALORA GROUP (HOLDINGS) CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. FAN JI QIAN because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring contractual consistency and honoring the agreed-upon dispute resolution mechanisms outweighed the negative effects (E-) of potentially limiting the third party's ability to pursue claims in a different forum.

Applying this rule to the current case:

- **Albright Cancer Research Foundation:** The Foundation can argue that the promised donations are derived from the contracts between M-Scan Ltd and its customers. Therefore, M-Scan Ltd should be held to the original terms of the contract, including the donation commitments, unless there is a strong reason to justify the change.
  
- **Care 2 U Ltd:** The exclusion clause in the contract between M-Scan Ltd and its customers should apply to Care 2 U Ltd, provided that the conditions for the exclusion (i.e., the systems check) were not met by Vulcanicity Ltd. This would mean that Care 2 U Ltd can rely on the exclusion clause to avoid liability for the damages during transportation.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (DICKSON VALORA GROUP (HOLDINGS) CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. FAN JI QIAN) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Privity of Contract and Third-Party Rights**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In the precedent case, Fan was not a party to the Shareholders Agreement or the 3rd Addendum but sought to enforce rights derived from these contracts. Similarly, in the current case, the Albright Cancer Research Foundation is not a direct party to the contracts between M-Scan Ltd and its customers but seeks to enforce the promised donations.

- **Legal Concept 2: Incorporation of Contractual Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** The court in the precedent case examined whether the arbitration clause in the Shareholders Agreement was incorporated into the 3rd Addendum. In the current case, we need to determine whether the exclusion clause in the contract between M-Scan Ltd and its customers applies to Care 2 U Ltd.

- **Legal Concept 3: Equitable Remedies and Anti-Suit Injunctions**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** The court in the precedent case granted an anti-suit injunction to prevent Fan from pursuing proceedings in a non-contractual forum. In the current case, the Albright Cancer Research Foundation may seek an equitable remedy to enforce the promised donations.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in DICKSON VALORA GROUP (HOLDINGS) CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. FAN JI QIAN, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Consistency in Contractual Obligations:**
   - Just as the court in the precedent case emphasized the importance of adhering to the terms and conditions of the original contract, enforcing the promised donations to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation would ensure that M-Scan Ltd honors its contractual commitments. This consistency is crucial for maintaining trust and reliability in commercial transactions.

2. **Protection of Third-Party Rights:**
   - The Albright Cancer Research Foundation, although not a direct party to the contracts, has relied on the promised donations for its funding. Allowing M-Scan Ltd to unilaterally reduce the donations would undermine the Foundation's financial planning and commitments. Protecting the Foundation's rights aligns with the principle of equitable remedies, ensuring that third parties who benefit from contractual promises are not unfairly prejudiced.

3. **Application of Exclusion Clauses:**
   - In the precedent case, the court examined the incorporation of contractual terms. Similarly, in the current case, the exclusion clause in the contract between M-Scan Ltd and its customers should apply to Care 2 U Ltd, provided that the conditions for the exclusion (i.e., the systems check) were not met by Vulcanicity Ltd. This would mean that Care 2 U Ltd can rely on the exclusion clause to avoid liability for the damages during transportation, ensuring that contractual terms are applied consistently and fairly.

4. **Equitable Intervention:**
   - The court's willingness to grant an anti-suit injunction in the precedent case to prevent proceedings in a non-contractual forum highlights the importance of equitable intervention to protect contractual rights. Similarly, the Albright Cancer Research Foundation may seek an equitable remedy to enforce the promised donations, ensuring that M-Scan Ltd cannot unilaterally alter the terms to the detriment of the Foundation.

Given these considerations, the court should reach the same outcome as in the precedent case. This decision would be justified because it would uphold the principles of contractual consistency, protection of third-party rights, fair application of exclusion clauses, and equitable intervention, thereby promoting fairness and reliability in commercial transactions.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case DICKSON VALORA GROUP (HOLDINGS) CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. FAN JI QIAN, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of an arbitration clause in the Shareholders Agreement, which was incorporated into the 3rd Addendum. This arbitration clause was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as maintaining consistency in dispute resolution and honoring the agreed-upon mechanisms, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided a clear and agreed-upon method for resolving disputes. However, in our current case, this crucial arbitration clause is notably absent as there is no similar clause governing the donation commitments to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation. The absence of such a clause means that there is no pre-agreed mechanism for resolving disputes related to the donation commitments, which significantly alters the context and the legal considerations.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the specific exclusion clause related to the systems check, that was not present in DICKSON VALORA GROUP (HOLDINGS) CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. FAN JI QIAN. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the exclusion clause directly impacts the liability of Care 2 U Ltd for damages during transportation. Due to this exclusion clause, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as potentially absolving Care 2 U Ltd of liability even when there might be negligence involved, than positive ones, unlike in DICKSON VALORA GROUP (HOLDINGS) CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. FAN JI QIAN. This is because the exclusion clause creates a specific condition (the systems check) that must be met for liability to be excluded, which adds a layer of complexity not present in the precedent case.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from **DICKSON VALORA GROUP (HOLDINGS) CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. FAN JI QIAN** should be stated as: "When both [a third party seeks to enforce rights derived from a contract] and [the contract contains an arbitration clause] are present, the court should decide [that the third party must adhere to the terms and conditions of the original contract, including any incorporated clauses]." Omitting [the contract contains an arbitration clause] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of inconsistent enforcement of contractual obligations and potential forum shopping, undermining the reliability and predictability of contractual agreements]. Indeed, the opinion in **DICKSON VALORA GROUP (HOLDINGS) CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. FAN JI QIAN** explicitly states that [the arbitration clause was crucial to their decision, as it provided a clear and agreed-upon method for resolving disputes].

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in **DICKSON VALORA GROUP (HOLDINGS) CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. FAN JI QIAN** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties circumventing agreed-upon dispute resolution mechanisms, leading to inconsistent and potentially unfair outcomes]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [circumventing an agreed-upon arbitration mechanism] occurring because [there is no arbitration clause governing the donation commitments to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation]. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the focus should be on the equitable principles and the specific terms of the exclusion clause in the contract between M-Scan Ltd and its customers.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the arbitration clause, which was present in the precedent case DICKSON VALORA GROUP (HOLDINGS) CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. FAN JI QIAN, requiring this factor for all similar cases of third-party enforcement of contractual rights would lead to the undesirable consequence of limiting the ability of third parties to seek equitable remedies when they are adversely affected by changes in contractual terms. Conversely, not requiring the arbitration clause would allow for the desirable outcome of ensuring that third parties, such as the Albright Cancer Research Foundation, can rely on the promised benefits and maintain their financial planning and commitments. This better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, which aim to protect the legitimate expectations and rights of third parties who benefit from contractual promises.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the arbitration clause, which was present in DICKSON VALORA GROUP (HOLDINGS) CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. FAN JI QIAN, we have the additional factor of the specific exclusion clause related to the systems check. This exclusion clause, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of third-party enforcement of contractual rights, serves a similar function to the arbitration clause in the precedent case by providing a clear condition that must be met for liability to be excluded. Given the presence of this exclusion clause, we submit that the reasoning in DICKSON VALORA GROUP (HOLDINGS) CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. FAN JI QIAN still applies, as the positive effects on contractual consistency and protection of third-party rights would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **DICKSON VALORA GROUP (HOLDINGS) CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. FAN JI QIAN**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations:

1. **Key Similarities**:
   - Both cases involve third parties seeking to enforce rights derived from contracts to which they are not direct parties.
   - Both cases require the court to consider the incorporation of contractual terms and the application of equitable remedies.

2. **Key Differences**:
   - The precedent case involved an arbitration clause, which provided a clear mechanism for dispute resolution, whereas the current case lacks such a clause.
   - The current case involves a specific exclusion clause related to a systems check, which was not a factor in the precedent case.

3. **Proposed Legal Rule**:
   - The rule from the precedent case suggests that third parties must adhere to the terms and conditions of the original contract, including any incorporated clauses, when seeking to enforce derived rights.

4. **Arguments Weighed**:
   - **For Albright Cancer Research Foundation**: The Foundation relies on the promised donations for its funding, and allowing M-Scan Ltd to unilaterally reduce the donations would undermine its financial planning and commitments. Protecting the Foundation's rights aligns with equitable principles.
   - **For Care 2 U Ltd**: The exclusion clause in the contract between M-Scan Ltd and its customers should apply, provided that the conditions for the exclusion (i.e., the systems check) were not met by Vulcanicity Ltd. This ensures that contractual terms are applied consistently and fairly.

5. **Legal Principles**:
   - **Privity of Contract and Third-Party Rights**: Generally, only parties to a contract can enforce its terms, but equitable principles and statutory reforms (e.g., Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance) can allow third parties to enforce certain rights.
   - **Incorporation of Contractual Terms**: Terms from one contract can be incorporated into another if the parties intended for them to be read together.
   - **Equitable Remedies**: Courts can intervene to protect the rights of third parties who benefit from contractual promises.

### Final Decision

Considering the underlying legal principles and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude as follows:

1. **Albright Cancer Research Foundation**: The Foundation can claim the promised revenue from M-Scan Ltd. The reduction in donations, despite the reduction in the annual fee, undermines the Foundation's financial planning and commitments. The equitable principles and the reliance of the Foundation on the promised donations justify enforcing the original terms of the contract. Therefore, M-Scan Ltd should be held to the original donation commitments unless there is a strong reason to justify the change.

2. **Care 2 U Ltd**: Care 2 U Ltd can rely on the exclusion clause in the contract between M-Scan Ltd and its customers. The exclusion clause is clear and specific, and Vulcanicity Ltd failed to undertake the required systems check. Therefore, Care 2 U Ltd is not liable for the damages during transportation, provided that the conditions for the exclusion were not met by Vulcanicity Ltd.

This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by protecting the legitimate expectations and rights of third parties and ensuring that contractual terms are applied fairly and consistently.


# Contract Law: Whether the Albright Cancer Research Foundation can enforce the original terms of the donation agreement

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Sections 6 and 7

### Major Premise:

1. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 6

   Conditions:
   - A third party may enforce a term of a contract under section 4.
   - The third party has assented to the term and the promisor has received notice of the assent; or
   - The third party has relied on the term and the promisor is aware of the reliance or can reasonably be expected to have foreseen that the third party would rely on the term.

   Consequences:
   - The parties to the contract may not, without the third party’s consent, rescind the contract or vary the contract so that the third party’s right under the term is altered or extinguished.

   Exceptions:
   - An express term of the contract provides that one or more parties to the contract may rescind or vary the contract without the third party’s consent; or
   - The third party’s consent to rescind or vary the contract is required in circumstances specified in the contract instead of those set out in subsection (2)(a) and (b); and
   - Before the circumstances set out in subsection (2)(a) or (b) occur, the third party is aware of the term referred to in subsection (3) or one or more parties to the contract have taken reasonable steps to make the third party aware of the term.

2. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 7

   Conditions:
   - A third party’s consent is required to rescind or vary a contract under section 6(1) or (3)(b).
   - A party to the contract applies to the court to make an order dispensing with the third party’s consent.

   Consequences:
   - The court may make the order if the other party or each other party to the contract agrees to rescind or vary the contract.
   - The court thinks it just and practicable to make the order.

   Exceptions:
   - The court does not think it just and practicable to make the order.

### Minor Premise:

1. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 6:
- The Albright Cancer Research Foundation is a third party that may enforce the term of the contract regarding the donation.
- The Foundation has relied on the term, and M-Scan Ltd is aware of the reliance as the Foundation has allocated funds based on the promised cash flow.
- M-Scan Ltd has given notice to existing customers that the donation terms will change, which alters the Foundation's right under the term.
- There is no express term in the contract that allows M-Scan Ltd to rescind or vary the contract without the Foundation’s consent.
- Therefore, the parties to the contract may not rescind or vary the contract without the Foundation’s consent.

2. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 7:
- The Foundation’s consent is required to rescind or vary the contract under section 6(1).
- M-Scan Ltd has not applied to the court to make an order dispensing with the Foundation’s consent.
- Even if M-Scan Ltd applies, the court must find it just and practicable to make the order, which is unlikely given the severe funding implications for the Foundation.

### Conclusion:

Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 6 applies, and M-Scan Ltd may not rescind or vary the contract without the Albright Cancer Research Foundation’s consent. Therefore, the Albright Cancer Research Foundation can enforce the original terms of the donation agreement.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA6381/97 BETWEEN WONG KWAI ON, WONG PING and WONG HING YAU Plaintiffs AND LEUNG WING CHEONG Defendant)
In the case of HCA6381/97 BETWEEN WONG KWAI ON, WONG PING and WONG HING YAU Plaintiffs AND LEUNG WING CHEONG Defendant (precedent p), the plaintiffs claimed the return of the initial deposit and liquidated damages due to the defendant's alleged breach of the estate agent's contract. The court ruled that the plaintiffs' failure to exchange a formal contract by the stipulated date did not constitute a repudiatory breach of the contract, provided they exchanged within a reasonable time. The defendant was not entitled to terminate the contract and forfeit the deposit solely based on the missed deadline, as time was not of the essence in the original contract.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA6381/97 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Contractual Obligations and Modifications**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA6381/97, the plaintiffs and defendant had a provisional agreement that was to be formalized, and the plaintiffs' failure to meet the initial deadline did not automatically constitute a breach. In the current case, M-Scan Ltd has modified the terms of the donation agreement with the Albright Cancer Research Foundation.
- **Legal Concept 2: Time of the Essence**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA6381/97, the court found that time was not of the essence unless explicitly stated. In the current case, there is no indication that the timing of the donations was explicitly made of the essence in the contract between M-Scan Ltd and the Albright Cancer Research Foundation.
- **Legal Concept 3: Breach and Remedies**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA6381/97, the court determined that a breach did not occur simply due to a missed deadline, provided actions were taken within a reasonable time. In the current case, M-Scan Ltd has given notice of the change in donation terms and adjusted the annual fee accordingly, which could be seen as a reasonable modification rather than a breach.
- **Legal Concept 4: Exclusion Clauses**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCA6381/97, the court examined the terms and conditions of the contract to determine the rights and obligations of the parties. In the current case, the exclusion clause in the contract between Vulcanicity Ltd and M-Scan Ltd will be scrutinized to determine if Care 2 U Ltd can rely on it to avoid liability for the damage.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA6381/97 BETWEEN WONG KWAI ON, WONG PING and WONG HING YAU Plaintiffs AND LEUNG WING CHEONG Defendant)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern where time is not explicitly made of the essence in a contract, the court should decide that a missed deadline does not automatically constitute a repudiatory breach, provided actions are taken within a reasonable time. This rule was justified in HCA6381/97 because the positive effects (E+) of allowing parties to rectify missed deadlines within a reasonable time frame support the underlying values of fairness and flexibility in contractual relationships, outweighing the negative effects (E-) of strict adherence to deadlines that were not explicitly made essential. 

In the current case, applying this rule means that the Albright Cancer Research Foundation may not be able to enforce the original terms of the donation agreement if M-Scan Ltd's modifications are deemed reasonable and communicated in a timely manner. Similarly, Care 2 U Ltd may rely on the exclusion clause if Vulcanicity Ltd failed to undertake the required systems check, as stipulated in the contract.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA6381/97 BETWEEN WONG KWAI ON, WONG PING and WONG HING YAU Plaintiffs AND LEUNG WING CHEONG Defendant) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Contractual Obligations and Modifications**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA6381/97, the plaintiffs and defendant had a provisional agreement that was to be formalized, and the plaintiffs' failure to meet the initial deadline did not automatically constitute a breach. In the current case, M-Scan Ltd has modified the terms of the donation agreement with the Albright Cancer Research Foundation.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Time of the Essence**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA6381/97, the court found that time was not of the essence unless explicitly stated. In the current case, there is no indication that the timing of the donations was explicitly made of the essence in the contract between M-Scan Ltd and the Albright Cancer Research Foundation.
  
- **Legal Concept 3: Breach and Remedies**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA6381/97, the court determined that a breach did not occur simply due to a missed deadline, provided actions were taken within a reasonable time. In the current case, M-Scan Ltd has given notice of the change in donation terms and adjusted the annual fee accordingly, which could be seen as a reasonable modification rather than a breach.
  
- **Legal Concept 4: Exclusion Clauses**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCA6381/97, the court examined the terms and conditions of the contract to determine the rights and obligations of the parties. In the current case, the exclusion clause in the contract between Vulcanicity Ltd and M-Scan Ltd will be scrutinized to determine if Care 2 U Ltd can rely on it to avoid liability for the damage.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA6381/97, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Fairness and Flexibility in Contractual Relationships**: Allowing M-Scan Ltd to modify the donation terms, provided they have given reasonable notice and adjusted the annual fee, supports the principle of fairness and flexibility in contractual relationships. This ensures that businesses can adapt to changing circumstances without being unduly penalized, provided they act reasonably and communicate changes effectively.

2. **Equitable Treatment of Time Stipulations**: Just as in HCA6381/97, where time was not of the essence unless explicitly stated, the same principle should apply here. This prevents one party from unilaterally imposing strict deadlines that were not originally agreed upon, thereby promoting equitable treatment of time stipulations in contracts.

3. **Reasonable Modifications and Remedies**: By recognizing that M-Scan Ltd's modifications are reasonable and communicated in a timely manner, the court would be upholding the principle that parties can make necessary adjustments to their agreements without being deemed in breach, provided these adjustments are reasonable and do not fundamentally alter the agreed terms.

4. **Enforcement of Exclusion Clauses**: Allowing Care 2 U Ltd to rely on the exclusion clause, given that Vulcanicity Ltd failed to undertake the required systems check, reinforces the importance of adhering to contractual terms and conditions. This ensures that parties are held accountable for their obligations and that exclusion clauses are enforced where applicable.

In conclusion, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA6381/97, it would have the positive effects of promoting fairness, flexibility, and equitable treatment in contractual relationships, while also ensuring that reasonable modifications and exclusion clauses are appropriately enforced.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA6381/97 BETWEEN WONG KWAI ON, WONG PING and WONG HING YAU Plaintiffs AND LEUNG WING CHEONG Defendant, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that time was not explicitly made of the essence in the contract. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as fairness and flexibility in contractual relationships, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it allowed parties to rectify missed deadlines within a reasonable time frame without being unduly penalized. However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as there is no indication that the timing of the donations was explicitly made of the essence in the contract between M-Scan Ltd and the Albright Cancer Research Foundation. Therefore, the absence of this factor does not significantly alter the balance of positive and negative effects in the current case.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the presence of an exclusion clause, that was not present in HCA6381/97 BETWEEN WONG KWAI ON, WONG PING and WONG HING YAU Plaintiffs AND LEUNG WING CHEONG Defendant. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the exclusion clause in the contract between Vulcanicity Ltd and M-Scan Ltd will be scrutinized to determine if Care 2 U Ltd can rely on it to avoid liability for the damage. Due to the presence of the exclusion clause, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as potentially allowing Care 2 U Ltd to avoid liability for damages that may have occurred during transportation, which could undermine the accountability and responsibility of the parties involved. Unlike in HCA6381/97, where the focus was on the timing of contractual obligations, the current case involves the enforcement of an exclusion clause that could significantly impact the rights and obligations of the parties.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from HCA6381/97 BETWEEN WONG KWAI ON, WONG PING and WONG HING YAU Plaintiffs AND LEUNG WING CHEONG Defendant should be stated as: "When both the shared fact pattern of contractual obligations and modifications (i*) and the presence of an exclusion clause (m) are present, the court should decide that the exclusion clause can be relied upon if the stipulated conditions are met (o)." Omitting the presence of the exclusion clause (m) from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence (q) of undermining the accountability and responsibility of the parties involved, as it would allow parties to avoid liability for damages without adhering to the agreed contractual terms. Indeed, the opinion in HCA6381/97 explicitly states that the terms and conditions of the contract are crucial to determining the rights and obligations of the parties, highlighting the relevance of the contractual terms to their decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in HCA6381/97 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence (u) of parties being unfairly penalized for missing deadlines that were not explicitly made of the essence in the contract. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence (u) occurring because the focus is on the enforcement of an exclusion clause rather than the timing of contractual obligations. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—preventing unfair penalties for missed deadlines—is not relevant to our situation, which involves the enforcement of an exclusion clause and the accountability for damages during transportation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the explicit stipulation that time is of the essence, which was present in the precedent case HCA6381/97 BETWEEN WONG KWAI ON, WONG PING and WONG HING YAU Plaintiffs AND LEUNG WING CHEONG Defendant, requiring this factor for all similar cases of contractual obligations and modifications would lead to the undesirable consequence of rigidly penalizing parties for missed deadlines that were not explicitly agreed upon as essential. Conversely, not requiring the explicit stipulation that time is of the essence would allow for a more flexible and fair approach, enabling parties to rectify missed deadlines within a reasonable time frame without being unduly penalized. This better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and flexibility in contractual relationships, as well as the equitable treatment of time stipulations in contracts.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the explicit stipulation that time is of the essence, which was present in HCA6381/97 BETWEEN WONG KWAI ON, WONG PING and WONG HING YAU Plaintiffs AND LEUNG WING CHEONG Defendant, we have the additional factor of an exclusion clause. This exclusion clause, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of contractual obligations and modifications, serves a similar function to the explicit stipulation of time being of the essence in the precedent case. Given the presence of the exclusion clause, we submit that the reasoning in HCA6381/97 still applies, as the positive effects on fairness, flexibility, and equitable treatment in contractual relationships would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA6381/97 BETWEEN WONG KWAI ON, WONG PING and WONG HING YAU Plaintiffs AND LEUNG WING CHEONG Defendant, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the issues of contractual obligations and modifications, and the principle that time is not of the essence unless explicitly stated. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the presence of an exclusion clause in the current case, which was not a factor in the precedent.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case—that a missed deadline does not automatically constitute a repudiatory breach provided actions are taken within a reasonable time—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the exclusion clause in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the exclusion clause should be enforced if the stipulated conditions are met, as it ensures accountability and adherence to contractual terms. On the other hand, the argument that modifications to the donation terms by M-Scan Ltd should be seen as reasonable and communicated in a timely manner also holds merit, promoting fairness and flexibility in contractual relationships.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, flexibility, and equitable treatment in contractual relationships, as well as the importance of enforcing exclusion clauses to maintain accountability, we conclude that:

1. **Albright Cancer Research Foundation's Claim**: The Albright Cancer Research Foundation may not be able to enforce the original terms of the donation agreement if M-Scan Ltd's modifications are deemed reasonable and communicated in a timely manner. The reduction in the annual fee by 5% in recognition of the change in donation terms supports the reasonableness of the modification.

2. **Care 2 U Ltd's Reliance on the Exclusion Clause**: Care 2 U Ltd can rely on the exclusion clause in the contract between Vulcanicity Ltd and M-Scan Ltd, provided that Vulcanicity Ltd failed to undertake the required systems check as stipulated. The exclusion clause is clear and enforceable, and Vulcanicity Ltd's failure to comply with the contractual requirement to perform the systems check means that Care 2 U Ltd is not liable for the damages claimed.

This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by ensuring that contractual modifications are reasonable and communicated effectively, and that exclusion clauses are enforced where applicable.

   - The person cannot exclude or restrict his liability for other loss or damage resulting from negligence except in so far as the term or notice satisfies the requirement of reasonableness
   - The person’s agreement to or awareness of the contract term or notice is not of itself to be taken as indicating his voluntary acceptance of any risk

   Exceptions:
   - The term or notice satisfies the requirement of reasonableness in the case of other loss or damage

### Minor Premise:

1. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 8 Subsection 2:
- M-Scan Ltd deals on written standard terms of business with its customers.
- M-Scan Ltd is in breach of contract by unilaterally changing the donation terms.
- M-Scan Ltd attempts to exclude or restrict liability for this breach by reducing the annual fee.
- The contract term does not satisfy the requirement of reasonableness as it unilaterally changes the agreed terms without proper negotiation or consent from the Albright Cancer Research Foundation.
- Therefore, M-Scan Ltd cannot exclude or restrict liability for the breach.

2. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 7 Subsections 1-3:
- Care 2 U Ltd attempts to exclude liability for damage during transportation unless a systems check is performed.
- Vulcanicity Ltd did not perform the systems check, but the driver from Care 2 U Ltd did not recognize the difference.
- The exclusion clause must satisfy the requirement of reasonableness.
- Given the circumstances, the exclusion clause may not be reasonable as it places an undue burden on the customer and the driver’s failure to recognize the paperwork difference contributed to the issue.
- Therefore, Care 2 U Ltd cannot rely on the exclusion clause to exclude liability for the damage.

### Conclusion:

1. The Albright Cancer Research Foundation can claim the promised revenue from M-Scan Ltd as the exclusion clause attempting to change the donation terms is not reasonable and thus not enforceable.
2. Care 2 U Ltd cannot rely on the exclusion clause in the contract between Vulcanicity Ltd and M-Scan Ltd to exclude liability for the damage to the equipment during transportation.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE)

In the case of HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE (precedent p), the court ruled that the exclusion clause in the contract did not absolve the defendants from liability for loss and damage that could have been avoided with reasonable diligence. The court found that the theft of Container X was not an event akin to force majeure and that the defendants had a duty to ensure proper procedures for the safekeeping and delivery of the containers. Consequently, the defendants were held liable for the loss.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Exclusion Clauses**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the contracts contained exclusion clauses that purported to limit or exclude liability for certain types of loss or damage.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Reasonable Diligence**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In both cases, the issue of whether the party seeking to rely on the exclusion clause exercised reasonable diligence in preventing the loss or damage was central to the court's decision.
  
- **Legal Concept 3: Force Majeure and Unavoidable Events**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In both cases, the court examined whether the events causing the loss or damage were akin to force majeure or truly unavoidable.
  
- **Legal Concept 4: Interpretation of Contractual Terms**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In both cases, the court interpreted the contractual terms, particularly the exclusion clauses, in light of the surrounding factual matrix and the parties' intentions.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of an exclusion clause being invoked to limit liability for loss or damage, the court should decide that the exclusion clause does not apply if the loss or damage could have been avoided with reasonable diligence. This rule was justified in HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE because the positive effects (E+) of holding parties accountable for preventable losses promote diligence and responsibility in contractual relationships, outweighing the negative effects (E-) of potentially limiting the scope of exclusion clauses.

Applying this rule to the current case:

1. **Albright Cancer Research Foundation's Claim**: The Foundation may argue that M-Scan Ltd's unilateral change to the donation terms constitutes a breach of contract, especially if the original terms were a significant factor in their financial planning. However, if the contract allows for such changes with notice, the Foundation's claim may be weaker.

2. **Care 2 U Ltd's Reliance on the Exclusion Clause**: Care 2 U Ltd can rely on the exclusion clause only if they can demonstrate that the damage to the equipment was not due to their negligence and that they exercised reasonable diligence. Given that the driver was new and did not recognize the paperwork difference, it may be challenging for Care 2 U Ltd to prove they exercised reasonable diligence, potentially making the exclusion clause inapplicable.

Thus, the precedent supports the view that exclusion clauses will not protect a party from liability if the loss or damage could have been avoided with reasonable diligence.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Exclusion Clauses**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: The contract between M-Scan Ltd and its customers contains an exclusion clause that purports to limit liability for damages during transportation, delivery, or return if the user has not undertaken the recommended systems check.

- **Legal Concept 2: Reasonable Diligence**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: The issue of whether Care 2 U Ltd exercised reasonable diligence in preventing the damage to the equipment is central to the dispute. The driver from Care 2 U Ltd was new and did not recognize the difference in the paperwork, which raises questions about the diligence exercised.

- **Legal Concept 3: Force Majeure and Unavoidable Events**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: The court must determine whether the damage to the equipment was an event that could have been avoided with reasonable diligence, similar to how the court in the precedent case determined that the theft was not akin to force majeure.

- **Legal Concept 4: Interpretation of Contractual Terms**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: The court will need to interpret the exclusion clause in the contract between M-Scan Ltd and its customers in light of the surrounding factual matrix and the parties' intentions, just as it did in the precedent case.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Promoting Diligence and Responsibility**: Holding Care 2 U Ltd accountable for the damage if it could have been avoided with reasonable diligence promotes a higher standard of care and responsibility in contractual relationships. This ensures that parties cannot rely on exclusion clauses to escape liability for preventable losses.

2. **Fair Allocation of Risk**: The decision would ensure that the risk of loss or damage is fairly allocated between the parties. If Care 2 U Ltd did not exercise reasonable diligence, it is fair that they bear the responsibility for the damage, rather than shifting the burden to Vulcanicity Ltd.

3. **Encouraging Proper Procedures**: By not allowing the exclusion clause to absolve Care 2 U Ltd of liability, the court would encourage companies to implement and follow proper procedures for the safekeeping and delivery of goods, thereby reducing the likelihood of damage or loss.

4. **Consistency in Legal Principles**: Applying the same rule as in the precedent case ensures consistency in the application of legal principles, which is crucial for the predictability and stability of the law.

Therefore, the court should find that the exclusion clause in the contract between M-Scan Ltd and its customers does not absolve Care 2 U Ltd from liability for the damage to the equipment if it could have been avoided with reasonable diligence. This outcome aligns with the principles established in the precedent case and promotes fairness and responsibility in contractual relationships.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the defendants had a duty to ensure proper procedures for the safekeeping and delivery of the containers. This duty was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—promoting diligence and responsibility in contractual relationships—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it established a clear standard of care that the defendants failed to meet. However, in our current case, this crucial duty to ensure proper procedures is notably absent as the exclusion clause in the contract between M-Scan Ltd and its customers specifically places the onus on the user to undertake the recommended systems check and present the results in writing. This shifts the responsibility from the carrier to the user, altering the dynamics of diligence and responsibility.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—the specific contractual obligation on the user to undertake a systems check and present the results in writing—that was not present in HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces a clear, user-specific duty that, if unmet, activates the exclusion clause. Due to this user-specific duty, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as undermining the contractual allocation of responsibilities and potentially leading to users neglecting their agreed-upon duties, than positive ones. Unlike in HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE, where the carrier's duty was central, the current case's contractual framework places a significant duty on the user, which must be respected to maintain the balance of responsibilities and the integrity of the contractual agreement.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE should be stated as 'When both [the presence of an exclusion clause] and [the duty to ensure proper procedures for safekeeping and delivery] are present, the court should decide [that the exclusion clause does not absolve the carrier from liability if the loss or damage could have been avoided with reasonable diligence].' Omitting [the duty to ensure proper procedures for safekeeping and delivery] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of undermining the contractual allocation of responsibilities and potentially leading to users neglecting their agreed-upon duties]. Indeed, the opinion in HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE explicitly states that [the defendants had a duty to ensure proper procedures for the safekeeping and delivery of the containers, which was crucial to their decision].

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of carriers escaping liability for preventable losses due to their failure to exercise reasonable diligence]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [this specific undesirable consequence occurring] because the contract between M-Scan Ltd and its customers explicitly places the onus on the user to undertake the recommended systems check and present the results in writing. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The contractual framework in the current case shifts the responsibility to the user, and respecting this allocation of duties is crucial to maintaining the balance of responsibilities and the integrity of the contractual agreement.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the specific duty to ensure proper procedures for safekeeping and delivery, which was present in the precedent case HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE, requiring this factor for all similar cases of exclusion clauses would lead to the undesirable consequence of undermining the contractual allocation of responsibilities and potentially leading to users neglecting their agreed-upon duties. Conversely, not requiring this specific duty would allow for a more balanced approach that respects the contractual terms agreed upon by the parties, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, such as the sanctity of contract and the fair allocation of risk.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the specific duty to ensure proper procedures for safekeeping and delivery, which was present in HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE, we have the additional factor of a clear, user-specific duty to undertake a systems check and present the results in writing. This user-specific duty, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of an exclusion clause and the need for reasonable diligence, serves a similar function to the duty to ensure proper procedures in the precedent case. Given the presence of this user-specific duty, we submit that the reasoning in HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE still applies, as the positive effects on promoting diligence and responsibility in contractual relationships would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCAJ 106/2008 MAINTEK COMPUTER (SUZHOU) CO LTD. v. BLUE ANCHOR LINE, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of an exclusion clause and the issue of whether reasonable diligence was exercised. However, it also differs significantly in that the current case involves a specific contractual obligation on the user to undertake a systems check and present the results in writing, which was not present in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case—that exclusion clauses do not absolve a party from liability if the loss or damage could have been avoided with reasonable diligence—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the specific user obligations in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the exclusion clause should not protect Care 2 U Ltd if they failed to exercise reasonable diligence, and the counterargument that the user-specific duty shifts the responsibility to the user, altering the dynamics of diligence and responsibility.

Considering the underlying legal principles of contract law, such as the sanctity of contract and the fair allocation of risk, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the exclusion clause in the contract between M-Scan Ltd and its customers should be upheld, provided that Care 2 U Ltd can demonstrate that they exercised reasonable diligence in the transportation and delivery of the equipment.

Therefore, the Albright Cancer Research Foundation cannot claim the promised revenue from M-Scan Ltd if the contract allows for such changes with notice. As for Care 2 U Ltd, they can rely on the exclusion clause in the contract between Vulcanicity Ltd and M-Scan Ltd, provided they can prove that the damage was not due to their negligence and that they exercised reasonable diligence. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by respecting the contractual allocation of responsibilities and promoting diligence and responsibility in contractual relationships.


# Contract Law: Whether Vulcanicity Ltd's failure to undertake a systems check affects their ability to claim damages for the alleged transit damage

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

The Rules of the High Court Cap. 4 sub. leg. A Order 2 Rule 4, Rule 5(1), Rule 5(2) and (3)

### Major Premise:

1. The Rules of the High Court Cap. 4 sub. leg. A Order 2 Rule 4

   Conditions:
   - A party has failed to comply with a rule or court order.
   - Any sanction for failure to comply is imposed by the rule or court order.
   - The party in default does not apply to the Court for and obtain relief from the sanction within 14 days of the failure.

   Consequences:
   - The sanction for failure to comply imposed by the rule or court order has effect.

   Exceptions:
   - The party in default applies to the Court for and obtains relief from the sanction within 14 days of the failure.

2. The Rules of the High Court Cap. 4 sub. leg. A Order 2 Rule 5(1)

   Conditions:
   - There has been a failure to comply with the requirements of these rules in beginning or purporting to begin any proceedings or at any stage in the course of or in connection with any proceedings.
   - The failure is by reason of any thing done or left undone, whether in respect of time, place, manner, form or content or in any other respect.

   Consequences:
   - The failure shall be treated as an irregularity and shall not nullify the proceedings, any step taken in the proceedings, or any document, judgment or order therein.

   Exceptions:
   - None.

3. The Rules of the High Court Cap. 4 sub. leg. A Order 2 Rule 5(2) and (3)

   Conditions:
   - There has been a failure to comply with the requirements of these rules.
   - The Court considers it just to do so.

   Consequences:
   - The Court may set aside either wholly or in part the proceedings in which the failure occurred, any step taken in those proceedings or any document, judgment or order therein.
   - The Court may exercise its powers under these rules to allow such amendments to be made and to make such order dealing with the proceedings generally as it thinks fit.

   Exceptions:
   - The Court shall not wholly set aside any proceedings or the writ or other originating process by which they were begun on the ground that the proceedings ought to have begun by an originating process other than the one employed, but shall instead give directions for the continuation of the proceedings in an appropriate manner.

### Minor Premise:

1. The Rules of the High Court Cap. 4 sub. leg. A Order 2 Rule 4:
   - Vulcanicity Ltd failed to undertake a systems check before the scanner was collected.
   - The exclusion clause in the contract between Vulcanicity Ltd and M-Scan Ltd imposes a sanction for failure to comply (i.e., the carriers will not be liable for any damages done during transportation, delivery or return).
   - Vulcanicity Ltd did not apply to the Court for and obtain relief from the sanction within 14 days of the failure.
   - Therefore, the sanction for failure to comply imposed by the exclusion clause has effect.

2. The Rules of the High Court Cap. 4 sub. leg. A Order 2 Rule 5(1):
   - There has been a failure to comply with the requirements of the contract (i.e., undertaking the systems check).
   - The failure is by reason of something left undone (i.e., the systems check was not performed).
   - The failure shall be treated as an irregularity and shall not nullify the proceedings, any step taken in the proceedings, or any document, judgment or order therein.
   - Therefore, the failure to undertake the systems check does not nullify Vulcanicity Ltd's claim for damages.

3. The Rules of the High Court Cap. 4 sub. leg. A Order 2 Rule 5(2) and (3):
   - There has been a failure to comply with the requirements of the contract (i.e., undertaking the systems check).
   - The Court may consider it just to set aside the proceedings or make such order dealing with the proceedings generally as it thinks fit.
   - However, the Court shall not wholly set aside the proceedings on the ground that the proceedings ought to have begun by an originating process other than the one employed.
   - Therefore, the Court may allow Vulcanicity Ltd to amend their claim or make an appropriate order.

### Conclusion:

The Rules of the High Court Cap. 4 sub. leg. A Order 2 Rule 4 applies, and the sanction for failure to comply (i.e., the exclusion clause) has effect. Therefore, Care 2 U Ltd can rely on the exclusion clause in the contract between Vulcanicity Ltd and M-Scan Ltd.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (MAEDA KENSETSU KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA v. BAUER HONG KONG LTD)
In the case of MAEDA KENSETSU KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA v. BAUER HONG KONG LTD (precedent p), the court ruled that the defendant's failure to strictly comply with the notice requirements under Clause 21.2 of the Sub-Contract meant that they had no entitlement to additional payment or loss and expense. The court emphasized the importance of adhering to the clear and unambiguous language of the contractual provisions, which were conditions precedent to any claim.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in MAEDA KENSETSU KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA v. BAUER HONG KONG LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Strict Compliance with Contractual Provisions**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In MAEDA, the defendant failed to comply with the strict notice requirements under Clause 21.2, which was a condition precedent to any claim. In our current case, Vulcanicity Ltd failed to undertake the recommended systems check, which is a condition precedent to claiming damages for transit damage under the exclusion clause.
- **Legal Concept 2: Condition Precedent**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** In MAEDA, the court held that the notice requirements were conditions precedent that must be strictly complied with. In our current case, the exclusion clause stipulates that the systems check is a condition precedent to any claim for damages during transportation.
- **Legal Concept 3: Exclusion Clauses**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In MAEDA, the court interpreted the contractual provisions strictly, emphasizing the importance of clear and unambiguous language in exclusion clauses. In our current case, the exclusion clause in the contract between Vulcanicity Ltd and M-Scan Ltd is similarly clear and unambiguous in its requirement for a systems check.
- **Legal Concept 4: Allocation of Risk**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** In MAEDA, the court recognized that exclusion clauses in construction contracts are part of the contractual apparatus for distributing risk. In our current case, the exclusion clause serves to allocate the risk of damage during transportation to the party failing to comply with the systems check requirement.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (MAEDA KENSETSU KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA v. BAUER HONG KONG LTD)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern where a party fails to comply with a condition precedent stipulated in an exclusion clause, the court should decide that the party has no entitlement to claim damages. This rule was justified in MAEDA KENSETSU KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA v. BAUER HONG KONG LTD because the positive effects (E+) of enforcing strict compliance with contractual provisions outweigh the negative effects (E-) in that case. The court emphasized the importance of clear and unambiguous language in contractual provisions and the need for parties to adhere strictly to these provisions to ensure certainty and fairness in the allocation of risk.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (MAEDA KENSETSU KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA v. BAUER HONG KONG LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Strict Compliance with Contractual Provisions**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In MAEDA, the defendant failed to comply with the strict notice requirements under Clause 21.2, which was a condition precedent to any claim. In our current case, Vulcanicity Ltd failed to undertake the recommended systems check, which is a condition precedent to claiming damages for transit damage under the exclusion clause.

- **Legal Concept 2: Condition Precedent**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** In MAEDA, the court held that the notice requirements were conditions precedent that must be strictly complied with. In our current case, the exclusion clause stipulates that the systems check is a condition precedent to any claim for damages during transportation.

- **Legal Concept 3: Exclusion Clauses**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In MAEDA, the court interpreted the contractual provisions strictly, emphasizing the importance of clear and unambiguous language in exclusion clauses. In our current case, the exclusion clause in the contract between Vulcanicity Ltd and M-Scan Ltd is similarly clear and unambiguous in its requirement for a systems check.

- **Legal Concept 4: Allocation of Risk**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** In MAEDA, the court recognized that exclusion clauses in construction contracts are part of the contractual apparatus for distributing risk. In our current case, the exclusion clause serves to allocate the risk of damage during transportation to the party failing to comply with the systems check requirement.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in MAEDA KENSETSU KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA v. BAUER HONG KONG LTD. This decision would be justified because, as in MAEDA, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Certainty and Predictability:** Enforcing strict compliance with the exclusion clause ensures that all parties are aware of their obligations and the consequences of non-compliance. This promotes certainty and predictability in contractual relationships.

2. **Fair Allocation of Risk:** The exclusion clause is part of the contractual apparatus for distributing risk. By upholding the clause, the court ensures that the risk is allocated as agreed upon by the parties, which is fair and reasonable.

3. **Encouragement of Diligence:** Requiring strict compliance with the systems check condition precedent encourages parties to be diligent in fulfilling their contractual obligations. This can prevent disputes and ensure smooth operations.

4. **Respect for Contractual Autonomy:** The decision respects the autonomy of the parties to agree on their terms and conditions. It reinforces the principle that clear and unambiguous contractual provisions should be upheld.

Therefore, Care 2 U Ltd can rely on the exclusion clause in the contract between Vulcanicity Ltd and M-Scan Ltd, as Vulcanicity Ltd's failure to undertake the systems check precludes them from claiming damages for the alleged transit damage.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **MAEDA KENSETSU KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA v. BAUER HONG KONG LTD**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of a clear and unambiguous contractual provision that required strict compliance with notice requirements as a condition precedent to any claim. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as certainty and predictability in contractual relationships, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it reinforced the importance of adhering to agreed-upon terms and conditions.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of a clear and unambiguous contractual provision requiring strict compliance is notably absent. The exclusion clause in the contract between Vulcanicity Ltd and M-Scan Ltd does not explicitly state that the systems check is a condition precedent to any claim for damages. Instead, it merely states that the carriers will not be liable for any damages where the user has not undertaken the recommended systems check. This lack of explicit language regarding the condition precedent weakens the argument for strict compliance and introduces ambiguity, which was not present in the precedent case.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the administrative burden of the 1 per cent donation to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation, that was not present in **MAEDA KENSETSU KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA v. BAUER HONG KONG LTD**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces a new dimension of contractual performance and obligations that were not considered in the precedent case.

Due to this administrative burden, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as potential financial instability for the Albright Cancer Research Foundation and disruption of ongoing projects, than positive ones. Unlike in **MAEDA KENSETSU KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA v. BAUER HONG KONG LTD**, where the focus was on strict compliance with notice requirements, our case involves balancing the contractual obligations with the practical implications of administrative burdens and the impact on third parties. Therefore, the presence of this factor necessitates a different approach to ensure a fair and equitable outcome.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **MAEDA KENSETSU KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA v. BAUER HONG KONG LTD** should be stated as: "When both [strict compliance with contractual provisions] and [clear and unambiguous language regarding condition precedent] are present, the court should decide [that the party has no entitlement to claim damages]." Omitting [clear and unambiguous language regarding condition precedent] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q], which is the introduction of ambiguity and uncertainty in contractual relationships, thereby undermining the predictability and fairness that strict compliance aims to achieve. Indeed, the opinion in **MAEDA KENSETSU KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA v. BAUER HONG KONG LTD** explicitly states that [the clear and unambiguous language of the contractual provisions] was crucial to their decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **MAEDA KENSETSU KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA v. BAUER HONG KONG LTD** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties failing to adhere to agreed-upon terms and conditions, leading to uncertainty and unfairness in the allocation of risk]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [this specific undesirable consequence] occurring because the exclusion clause in the contract between Vulcanicity Ltd and M-Scan Ltd does not explicitly state that the systems check is a condition precedent to any claim for damages. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The lack of clear and unambiguous language regarding the condition precedent in the exclusion clause introduces ambiguity, which was not present in the precedent case, and thus the rule from **MAEDA KENSETSU KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA v. BAUER HONG KONG LTD** should not apply.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the clear and unambiguous language regarding the condition precedent, which was present in the precedent case **MAEDA KENSETSU KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA v. BAUER HONG KONG LTD**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of strict compliance with contractual provisions would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would introduce unnecessary rigidity and inflexibility in contractual relationships, potentially leading to unfair outcomes where minor technicalities could prevent legitimate claims. Conversely, not requiring the clear and unambiguous language regarding the condition precedent would allow for a more balanced and equitable approach, ensuring that parties are not unduly penalized for minor procedural lapses, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and justice in contract law.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the clear and unambiguous language regarding the condition precedent, which was present in **MAEDA KENSETSU KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA v. BAUER HONG KONG LTD**, we have the additional factor of the administrative burden of the 1 per cent donation to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation. This administrative burden, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of strict compliance with contractual provisions, serves a similar function to the clear and unambiguous language in the precedent case. Given the presence of this administrative burden, we submit that the reasoning in **MAEDA KENSETSU KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA v. BAUER HONG KONG LTD** still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as fairness, equity, and practical feasibility would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **MAEDA KENSETSU KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA v. BAUER HONG KONG LTD**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly the emphasis on strict compliance with contractual provisions and the role of exclusion clauses in allocating risk. However, it also differs in significant ways, notably the lack of clear and unambiguous language regarding the condition precedent in the exclusion clause and the additional factor of the administrative burden related to the donation to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation.

The proposed legal rule of requiring strict compliance with contractual provisions when clear and unambiguous language regarding condition precedent is present finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the administrative burden and the potential impact on third parties like the Albright Cancer Research Foundation.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that strict compliance ensures certainty and predictability in contractual relationships (as argued in the precedent case) and the counterpoint that the lack of clear language introduces ambiguity, which should not unduly penalize parties for minor procedural lapses.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, equity, and practical feasibility, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that:

1. **For the Albright Cancer Research Foundation's Claim:** M-Scan Ltd's unilateral decision to reduce the donation percentage and the annual fee, despite being administratively burdensome, does not absolve them of their contractual obligation to the Foundation. The Foundation can claim the promised revenue based on the original terms, as the change was not mutually agreed upon and has significant funding implications for the Foundation.

2. **For Care 2 U Ltd's Reliance on the Exclusion Clause:** Given the lack of clear and unambiguous language regarding the condition precedent in the exclusion clause, Vulcanicity Ltd's failure to undertake the systems check should not automatically preclude them from claiming damages. The exclusion clause should be interpreted narrowly, and Care 2 U Ltd cannot rely on it to avoid liability for the alleged transit damage without clear evidence that the systems check was a strict condition precedent.

Therefore, the decision reached balances the need for strict compliance with contractual provisions with the principles of fairness and equity, ensuring that parties are not unduly penalized for procedural lapses and that third-party interests are protected.


# Contract Law: Whether Care 2 U Ltd can rely on the exclusion clause to avoid liability for the damage to the scanner

### Minor Premise:

1. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 7 Subsection 1 and 2:
   - Care 2 U Ltd is attempting to exclude or restrict its liability for damage to the scanner during transportation.
   - The exclusion clause must satisfy the requirement of reasonableness to be enforceable.
   - The clause requires the user to undertake a systems check and present the results in writing to both Care 2 U Ltd and M-Scan Ltd.
   - Vulcanicity Ltd failed to undertake the systems check before the scanner was collected.

2. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 7 Subsection 3:
   - The exclusion clause purports to exclude or restrict liability for negligence.
   - Vulcanicity Ltd’s agreement to or awareness of the clause is not of itself to be taken as indicating its voluntary acceptance of any risk.

The exclusion clause in the contract between Vulcanicity Ltd and M-Scan Ltd is enforceable only if it satisfies the requirement of reasonableness. Given that Vulcanicity Ltd failed to undertake the systems check, the clause may be considered reasonable. Therefore, Care 2 U Ltd can rely on the exclusion clause to avoid liability for the damage to the scanner, provided the clause is deemed reasonable under the circumstances.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA007939/1997)
In the case of HCA007939/1997 (precedent p), the court dealt with the issue of whether an indemnity clause in a contract could be interpreted to cover negligence and other liabilities. The court ruled that the indemnity clause did not extend to cover the negligence of the party seeking indemnity unless explicitly stated. The court also emphasized the importance of clear and unequivocal language in contractual clauses to avoid ambiguity.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA007939/1997 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Interpretation of Contractual Clauses**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In HCA007939/1997, the court interpreted the indemnity clause to determine its scope and applicability. Similarly, in our current case, the exclusion clause in the contract between M-Scan Ltd and Vulcanicity Ltd needs to be interpreted to determine its applicability.

- **Legal Concept 2: Exclusion of Liability**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** In HCA007939/1997, the court examined whether the indemnity clause excluded liability for negligence. In our current case, the exclusion clause aims to exclude liability for damages during transportation if certain conditions are not met.

- **Legal Concept 3: Requirement of Clear and Unequivocal Language**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** The court in HCA007939/1997 emphasized the need for clear and unequivocal language in contractual clauses to avoid ambiguity. Similarly, the exclusion clause in our current case must be clear and unequivocal to be enforceable.

- **Legal Concept 4: Allocation of Responsibility**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** In HCA007939/1997, the court discussed the allocation of responsibility between parties based on the contractual terms. In our current case, the allocation of responsibility for damages to the scanner during transportation hinges on the interpretation of the exclusion clause.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA007939/1997)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a contractual clause that aims to exclude or limit liability (fact pattern i*), the court should decide that such a clause is enforceable only if it is clear and unequivocal in its language and scope (outcome o). This rule was justified in HCA007939/1997 because the positive effects (E+) of requiring clear and unequivocal language in exclusion or indemnity clauses ensure that parties are fully aware of their rights and obligations, thereby reducing the likelihood of disputes and promoting fairness in contractual relationships. The negative effects (E-) of not enforcing ambiguous clauses are outweighed by the need for clarity and certainty in contractual dealings.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA007939/1997) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Interpretation of Contractual Clauses**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In HCA007939/1997, the court interpreted the indemnity clause to determine its scope and applicability. Similarly, in our current case, the exclusion clause in the contract between M-Scan Ltd and Vulcanicity Ltd needs to be interpreted to determine its applicability.

- **Legal Concept 2: Exclusion of Liability**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** In HCA007939/1997, the court examined whether the indemnity clause excluded liability for negligence. In our current case, the exclusion clause aims to exclude liability for damages during transportation if certain conditions are not met.

- **Legal Concept 3: Requirement of Clear and Unequivocal Language**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** The court in HCA007939/1997 emphasized the need for clear and unequivocal language in contractual clauses to avoid ambiguity. Similarly, the exclusion clause in our current case must be clear and unequivocal to be enforceable.

- **Legal Concept 4: Allocation of Responsibility**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** In HCA007939/1997, the court discussed the allocation of responsibility between parties based on the contractual terms. In our current case, the allocation of responsibility for damages to the scanner during transportation hinges on the interpretation of the exclusion clause.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA007939/1997, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Clarity and Certainty in Contractual Relationships:** Requiring clear and unequivocal language in exclusion clauses ensures that all parties are fully aware of their rights and obligations. This reduces the likelihood of disputes and promotes fairness in contractual dealings.

2. **Fair Allocation of Risk:** By enforcing only those exclusion clauses that are clear and unequivocal, the court ensures that the allocation of risk between parties is fair and transparent. This prevents one party from unfairly shifting the burden of liability onto another party without their explicit agreement.

3. **Encouragement of Diligence:** Clear and unequivocal exclusion clauses encourage parties to be diligent in their contractual obligations. In this case, it would encourage Vulcanicity Ltd to undertake the recommended systems check and present the results in writing, thereby ensuring the equipment is in good working order before transportation.

4. **Consistency in Legal Precedents:** Applying the same rule as in HCA007939/1997 promotes consistency in legal precedents, which is a fundamental principle of common law systems. This consistency helps in predicting legal outcomes and provides a stable legal environment for businesses to operate.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA007939/1997, it would have the positive effects of promoting clarity, fairness, diligence, and consistency in contractual relationships.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA007939/1997, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of a clear and unequivocal indemnity clause. This clear indemnity clause was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as promoting clarity and certainty in contractual relationships, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided a straightforward interpretation of the parties' obligations and liabilities. However, in our current case, this crucial clear and unequivocal indemnity clause is notably absent as the exclusion clause in the contract between M-Scan Ltd and Vulcanicity Ltd is not as clear and unequivocal. The clause requires the user to undertake a systems check and present the results in writing, but it does not explicitly state the consequences of failing to do so in a manner that is as clear and unequivocal as the indemnity clause in HCA007939/1997.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the administrative burden of the 1 per cent donation to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation, that was not present in HCA007939/1997. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces an additional layer of complexity regarding the contractual obligations and the impact on third parties. Due to this administrative burden, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as potential financial instability for the Albright Cancer Research Foundation and a breach of trust with existing customers, than positive ones, unlike in HCA007939/1997. The precedent case did not involve third-party beneficiaries or the administrative complexities associated with ongoing charitable donations, which significantly impacts the balance of positive and negative effects in our current case.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA007939/1997 should be stated as: "When both the shared fact pattern of a contractual clause aiming to exclude or limit liability (i*) and the presence of a clear and unequivocal indemnity clause (m) are present, the court should decide that such a clause is enforceable only if it is clear and unequivocal in its language and scope (o)." Omitting the presence of a clear and unequivocal indemnity clause (m) from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence (q) of parties being unfairly bound by ambiguous exclusion clauses, which could result in unjust outcomes and increased litigation due to the lack of clarity in contractual obligations. Indeed, the opinion in HCA007939/1997 explicitly states that the clear and unequivocal language in the indemnity clause was crucial to their decision, as it provided a straightforward interpretation of the parties' obligations and liabilities.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA007939/1997 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence (u) of parties being unfairly bound by ambiguous indemnity or exclusion clauses, which could lead to unjust outcomes and increased litigation. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence occurring because the exclusion clause in the contract between M-Scan Ltd and Vulcanicity Ltd is not as clear and unequivocal as the indemnity clause in HCA007939/1997. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—to ensure clarity and fairness in contractual obligations—is not relevant to our situation due to the lack of a clear and unequivocal indemnity clause.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the clear and unequivocal indemnity clause (factor m), which was present in the precedent case HCA007939/1997, requiring this factor for all similar cases of interpreting exclusion or indemnity clauses (fact pattern i*) would lead to the undesirable consequence of parties being unfairly bound by ambiguous exclusion clauses. This could result in unjust outcomes and increased litigation due to the lack of clarity in contractual obligations. Conversely, not requiring the clear and unequivocal indemnity clause (m) would allow for a more flexible interpretation of exclusion clauses, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, such as fairness and the intention of the parties. This approach ensures that parties are not unfairly disadvantaged by overly rigid interpretations and promotes a more equitable resolution of disputes.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the clear and unequivocal indemnity clause (factor m), which was present in HCA007939/1997, we have the additional factor of the administrative burden of the 1 per cent donation to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation (factor n). This factor n, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of interpreting exclusion clauses (i*), serves a similar function to the clear and unequivocal indemnity clause (m) in the precedent case. Given the presence of the administrative burden (n), we submit that the reasoning in HCA007939/1997 still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as fairness, clarity, and the intention of the parties would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. This ensures that the exclusion clause is interpreted in a manner that is fair and equitable, taking into account the practical realities and the intentions of the parties involved.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA007939/1997, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in the interpretation of contractual clauses and the requirement for clear and unequivocal language to exclude or limit liability. However, it also differs in significant ways, such as the absence of a clear and unequivocal indemnity clause and the additional factor of the administrative burden of the 1 per cent donation to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation.

The proposed legal rule from HCA007939/1997—that exclusion or indemnity clauses are enforceable only if they are clear and unequivocal in their language and scope—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the unique circumstances of the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the need for clear and unequivocal language in exclusion clauses to ensure fairness and the practical realities of the administrative burden faced by M-Scan Ltd. The argument that the exclusion clause in the current case is not as clear and unequivocal as the indemnity clause in HCA007939/1997 is compelling. This lack of clarity could lead to unjust outcomes and increased litigation, which the precedent aimed to avoid.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, clarity, and the intention of the parties, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Care 2 U Ltd cannot rely on the exclusion clause to avoid liability for the damage to the scanner. The exclusion clause in the contract between M-Scan Ltd and Vulcanicity Ltd is not sufficiently clear and unequivocal to exclude liability, especially given the administrative burden and the potential impact on third parties like the Albright Cancer Research Foundation.

Therefore, the decision reached is that the exclusion clause is not enforceable in this instance, and Care 2 U Ltd may be held liable for the damage to the scanner. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by ensuring that exclusion clauses are interpreted in a manner that is fair and equitable, taking into account the practical realities and the intentions of the parties involved.


# Contract Law: Whether the driver from Care 2 U Ltd's failure to recognize the paperwork affects the enforceability of the exclusion clause

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (CACV 426/2000)
In the case of CACV 426/2000 BETWEEN AU KWOK HUNG Applicant AND THE APPEAL PANEL APPOINTED UNDER SECTION 7A(1) OF THE HOUSING ORDINANCE (CAP. 283) Respondent (precedent p), the facts were as follows: Mr. Au Kwok Hung, a tenant, failed to pay rent due to illness and absence from Hong Kong. The Housing Authority terminated his tenancy and served a notice to quit. Mr. Au did not appeal within the statutory 15-day period due to his absence and ill-health. The appeal panel refused to entertain his late appeal, and this decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal. The court ruled that the statutory time limit for lodging an appeal was imperative and not capable of being waived, thus barring Mr. Au's appeal (outcome o).

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in CACV 426/2000 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Statutory Time Limits and Compliance**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In CACV 426/2000, the statutory time limit for lodging an appeal was strictly enforced, and non-compliance barred the appeal. In the current case, the exclusion clause requires a systems check to be performed and documented before transportation.

- **Legal Concept 2: Contractual Obligations and Exclusion Clauses**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In CACV 426/2000, the Housing Authority's right to terminate the tenancy was exercised according to the terms of the lease and statutory provisions. In the current case, the exclusion clause in the contract between M-Scan Ltd and its customers outlines specific conditions under which liability is excluded.

- **Legal Concept 3: Procedural Requirements and Consequences of Non-Compliance**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In CACV 426/2000, the failure to comply with the procedural requirement (lodging an appeal within 15 days) resulted in the loss of the right to appeal. In the current case, Vulcanicity Ltd's failure to perform the required systems check before transportation may affect the enforceability of the exclusion clause.

- **Legal Concept 4: Interpretation of Legislative and Contractual Provisions**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In CACV 426/2000, the court interpreted the legislative provisions strictly, emphasizing the importance of compliance with statutory requirements. In the current case, the interpretation of the exclusion clause will determine whether Care 2 U Ltd can rely on it to exclude liability for damages.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (CACV 426/2000)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern involving a failure to comply with a procedural requirement that is explicitly stated as imperative in a contract or statute, the court should decide that non-compliance results in the loss of the associated right or benefit (outcome o). This rule was justified in CACV 426/2000 because the strict enforcement of procedural requirements ensures clarity, predictability, and fairness in legal and contractual relationships. The positive effects (E+) of outcome o include upholding the integrity of statutory and contractual provisions, promoting adherence to agreed-upon terms, and preventing potential abuses or uncertainties that could arise from non-compliance. The negative effects (E-) are outweighed by these benefits, as the rule provides a clear and enforceable standard for all parties involved.

Applying this rule to the current case, Care 2 U Ltd can rely on the exclusion clause in the contract between Vulcanicity Ltd and M-Scan Ltd, provided that the procedural requirement (the systems check) was not complied with by Vulcanicity Ltd. The failure to perform the systems check as stipulated in the contract would bar Vulcanicity Ltd from claiming damages for any issues that arose during transportation, as the exclusion clause would be enforceable under the established legal rule.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (CACV 426/2000) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Statutory Time Limits and Compliance**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In CACV 426/2000, the statutory time limit for lodging an appeal was strictly enforced, and non-compliance barred the appeal. In the current case, the exclusion clause requires a systems check to be performed and documented before transportation.

- **Legal Concept 2: Contractual Obligations and Exclusion Clauses**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In CACV 426/2000, the Housing Authority's right to terminate the tenancy was exercised according to the terms of the lease and statutory provisions. In the current case, the exclusion clause in the contract between M-Scan Ltd and its customers outlines specific conditions under which liability is excluded.

- **Legal Concept 3: Procedural Requirements and Consequences of Non-Compliance**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In CACV 426/2000, the failure to comply with the procedural requirement (lodging an appeal within 15 days) resulted in the loss of the right to appeal. In the current case, Vulcanicity Ltd's failure to perform the required systems check before transportation may affect the enforceability of the exclusion clause.

- **Legal Concept 4: Interpretation of Legislative and Contractual Provisions**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In CACV 426/2000, the court interpreted the legislative provisions strictly, emphasizing the importance of compliance with statutory requirements. In the current case, the interpretation of the exclusion clause will determine whether Care 2 U Ltd can rely on it to exclude liability for damages.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in CACV 426/2000. This decision would be justified because, as in CACV 426/2000, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Contractual Integrity**: Enforcing the exclusion clause as written ensures that the terms agreed upon by the parties are respected and upheld. This promotes certainty and predictability in contractual relationships, which is fundamental to commercial transactions.

2. **Encouraging Compliance with Procedural Requirements**: By strictly enforcing the requirement for a systems check, the court would encourage parties to adhere to procedural obligations, thereby reducing disputes and potential liabilities.

3. **Preventing Potential Abuses**: Allowing exceptions to the exclusion clause could lead to abuses where parties might neglect procedural requirements and still seek to hold others liable. Strict enforcement prevents such scenarios and maintains fairness.

4. **Efficiency in Legal and Commercial Practices**: Clear and enforceable standards reduce the need for litigation and administrative burdens, promoting efficiency in both legal and commercial practices.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in CACV 426/2000, it would uphold the integrity of contractual provisions, encourage compliance with procedural requirements, prevent potential abuses, and promote efficiency in legal and commercial practices.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the exclusion clause's specific procedural requirement for a systems check, that was not present in CACV 426/2000. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of procedural requirements and consequences of non-compliance. In CACV 426/2000, the procedural requirement was a statutory time limit for lodging an appeal, which was strictly enforced to maintain legal certainty and efficiency. However, in our current case, the procedural requirement is a contractual obligation to perform a systems check before transportation.

Due to the presence of this specific procedural requirement in the exclusion clause, applying the same outcome (strict enforcement of procedural requirements) in our case would have more negative consequences than positive ones. The negative consequences include potentially unjustly absolving Care 2 U Ltd of liability for damages that may have occurred during transportation, despite the procedural oversight by a new driver who did not recognize the paperwork. This could lead to an unfair outcome for Vulcanicity Ltd, who may have genuinely handed over the equipment in good condition.

Unlike in CACV 426/2000, where the strict enforcement of the statutory time limit was justified to uphold legal certainty and prevent abuses, the strict enforcement of the exclusion clause in our case could result in an inequitable situation. The balance of positive and negative effects is significantly altered due to the specific context and nature of the procedural requirement in the exclusion clause. Therefore, the court should consider the unique circumstances of the current case and potentially allow for some flexibility in interpreting the exclusion clause to ensure a fair and just outcome.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from CACV 426/2000 should be stated as: "When both a statutory or contractual procedural requirement and the specific context of the procedural requirement being related to a systems check are present, the court should decide that non-compliance results in the loss of the associated right or benefit." Omitting the specific context of the procedural requirement being related to a systems check from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of unjustly absolving a party of liability for damages that may have occurred during transportation, despite procedural oversights. Indeed, the opinion in CACV 426/2000 explicitly states that strict compliance with procedural requirements is crucial to maintain legal certainty and efficiency. However, this strict compliance was in the context of a statutory time limit, not a contractual systems check.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in CACV 426/2000 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of legal uncertainty and inefficiency that could arise from allowing late appeals. However, in our current case, there's no risk of such legal uncertainty or inefficiency occurring. The procedural requirement in question is a contractual obligation to perform a systems check before transportation, which is fundamentally different from a statutory time limit for lodging an appeal. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—maintaining legal certainty and efficiency in the context of statutory time limits—is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should consider the unique circumstances of the current case and potentially allow for some flexibility in interpreting the exclusion clause to ensure a fair and just outcome.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the specific context of a statutory time limit, which was present in the precedent case CACV 426/2000, requiring this factor for all similar cases of procedural requirements and consequences of non-compliance would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would unjustly absolve parties of liability for damages that may have occurred due to procedural oversights, even when those oversights are minor or understandable. Conversely, not requiring the specific context of a statutory time limit would allow for a more nuanced and fair interpretation of exclusion clauses in contracts, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, such as fairness, equity, and the intention of the parties.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the specific context of a statutory time limit, which was present in CACV 426/2000, we have the additional factor of the exclusion clause's specific procedural requirement for a systems check. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of procedural requirements and consequences of non-compliance, serves a similar function to the statutory time limit in the precedent case. Given the presence of this specific procedural requirement, we submit that the reasoning in CACV 426/2000 still applies, as the positive effects on contractual integrity, encouraging compliance with procedural requirements, and preventing potential abuses would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to CACV 426/2000, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in terms of the importance of procedural compliance and the consequences of non-compliance. Both cases involve strict adherence to procedural requirements—statutory time limits in CACV 426/2000 and contractual obligations in the current case.

However, the key difference lies in the nature of the procedural requirement. In CACV 426/2000, the procedural requirement was a statutory time limit for lodging an appeal, which was strictly enforced to maintain legal certainty and efficiency. In the current case, the procedural requirement is a contractual obligation to perform a systems check before transportation, which serves a different function and context.

The proposed legal rule from CACV 426/2000—that non-compliance with a procedural requirement results in the loss of the associated right or benefit—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the need for strict compliance to uphold contractual integrity and the potential for unjust outcomes if minor procedural oversights lead to significant consequences.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, equity, and the intention of the parties, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the exclusion clause in the contract between M-Scan Ltd and its customers should be interpreted with some flexibility. While procedural requirements are important, the specific context and nature of the requirement in this case—performing a systems check—warrant a more nuanced approach.

Therefore, Care 2 U Ltd cannot solely rely on the exclusion clause to absolve itself of liability for damages during transportation if Vulcanicity Ltd can provide evidence that the equipment was in working order when handed over. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency, ensuring that procedural requirements are respected without leading to unjust outcomes.

In conclusion, the exclusion clause should be enforced with consideration of the specific circumstances, and Care 2 U Ltd's liability should be assessed based on the evidence of the equipment's condition at the time of handover. This approach balances the need for procedural compliance with the principles of fairness and equity.

### Minor Premise:

1. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, Cap. 71:
- The standard form contract between M-Scan Ltd and its customers contains an exclusion clause that restricts the liability of Care 2 U Ltd for any damages done during transportation, delivery, or return, where the user of the equipment has not undertaken the recommended systems check and presented the results in writing to both Care 2 U Ltd and M-Scan Ltd.
- Vulcanicity Ltd failed to undertake the systems check before the scanner was collected.
- The driver from Care 2 U Ltd did not recognize the difference in the paperwork and accepted the equipment.
- Vulcanicity Ltd claims the equipment was in working order when given to Care 2 U Ltd and that the damage must have happened in transit.

### Conclusion:

The exclusion clause in the contract between M-Scan Ltd and its customers, including Vulcanicity Ltd, would be of no effect unless it satisfies the requirement of reasonableness as stated in section 3(1) of the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, Cap.71. Given that the clause places a significant burden on the customer to perform a systems check and provide written results, its reasonableness may be questioned. Therefore, Care 2 U Ltd may not be able to rely on the exclusion clause to avoid liability for the damage to the equipment.

- The existing customer base agreed to the new arrangements, but the Albright Cancer Research Foundation did not consent to this change and claims it will have severe funding implications.

### Conclusion:

The unilateral variation of the donation terms by M-Scan Ltd may be considered a breach of contract with respect to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation, as the Foundation did not consent to the change and the original contract did not allow for such unilateral variation. Therefore, the Albright Cancer Research Foundation may have a valid claim for the promised revenue from M-Scan Ltd.

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (CHIMBUSCO PAN NATION PETRO CHEMICAL CO LTD V. ARKSTAR SHIP MANAGEMENT PTE LTD)

In the case of CHIMBUSCO PAN NATION PETRO CHEMICAL CO LTD V. ARKSTAR SHIP MANAGEMENT PTE LTD (precedent p), the court ruled that the exclusion clauses in the contract were enforceable because the plaintiff failed to plead and prove the reasonableness of the clauses under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap 71). The court emphasized that the party seeking to rely on an exclusion clause must plead and prove its reasonableness, and failure to do so would preclude reliance on the clause.

  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the contracts contain exclusion clauses that limit the liability of one party for certain types of damages.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Reasonableness under Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap 71)**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In both cases, the reasonableness of the exclusion clauses is challenged under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap 71).

- **Legal Concept 3: Pleading and Proving Reasonableness**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In both cases, the party seeking to rely on the exclusion clause must plead and prove its reasonableness.

- **Legal Concept 4: Consequences of Failure to Plead Reasonableness**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In both cases, failure to plead and prove the reasonableness of the exclusion clause results in the clause being unenforceable.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (CHIMBUSCO PAN NATION PETRO CHEMICAL CO LTD V. ARKSTAR SHIP MANAGEMENT PTE LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern where an exclusion clause is challenged under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap 71), the court should decide that the party seeking to rely on the exclusion clause must plead and prove its reasonableness. This rule was justified in CHIMBUSCO PAN NATION PETRO CHEMICAL CO LTD V. ARKSTAR SHIP MANAGEMENT PTE LTD because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that exclusion clauses are reasonable and fair outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially invalidating contractual terms that have not been properly justified. This approach upholds the underlying values and principles of contract law, which include fairness, transparency, and the protection of parties from unreasonable and unfair contractual terms.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (CHIMBUSCO PAN NATION PETRO CHEMICAL CO LTD V. ARKSTAR SHIP MANAGEMENT PTE LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Exclusion Clauses**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: The contract between M-Scan Ltd and its customers contains an exclusion clause that limits the liability of Care 2 U Ltd for damages during transportation, delivery, or return if the user has not undertaken the recommended systems check and presented the results in writing.

- **Legal Concept 2: Reasonableness under Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap 71)**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: The reasonableness of the exclusion clause in the contract between M-Scan Ltd and its customers is challenged under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap 71).

- **Legal Concept 3: Pleading and Proving Reasonableness**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: Care 2 U Ltd, seeking to rely on the exclusion clause, must plead and prove its reasonableness.

- **Legal Concept 4: Consequences of Failure to Plead Reasonableness**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: Failure to plead and prove the reasonableness of the exclusion clause would result in the clause being unenforceable.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in CHIMBUSCO PAN NATION PETRO CHEMICAL CO LTD V. ARKSTAR SHIP MANAGEMENT PTE LTD. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Fairness and Transparency**: By requiring Care 2 U Ltd to plead and prove the reasonableness of the exclusion clause, the court ensures that the clause is fair and transparent, protecting the interests of the customers, including Vulcanicity Ltd.

2. **Protection from Unreasonable Terms**: This approach protects parties from being bound by unreasonable and unfair contractual terms, which is a fundamental principle of contract law.

3. **Encouraging Proper Pleading and Evidence**: It encourages parties to properly plead and provide evidence for the reasonableness of exclusion clauses, promoting thorough and well-supported legal arguments.

4. **Consistency in Legal Application**: Applying the same rule ensures consistency in the application of the law, providing predictability and stability in contractual relationships.

Therefore, the court should require Care 2 U Ltd to plead and prove the reasonableness of the exclusion clause. If Care 2 U Ltd fails to do so, the exclusion clause should be deemed unenforceable, and Vulcanicity Ltd should not be precluded from claiming damages for the alleged damage to the equipment during transit.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the charitable donation to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation, that was not present in [CHIMBUSCO PAN NATION PETRO CHEMICAL CO LTD V. ARKSTAR SHIP MANAGEMENT PTE LTD]. This factor significantly alters the situation described by [i*] because it introduces an element of public interest and reliance on promised funds for charitable purposes. Due to this factor, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining public trust in contractual commitments to charitable donations and potentially harming the financial stability of the charity, unlike in [CHIMBUSCO PAN NATION PETRO CHEMICAL CO LTD V. ARKSTAR SHIP MANAGEMENT PTE LTD] because that case did not involve any public interest or reliance on charitable donations.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from [CHIMBUSCO PAN NATION PETRO CHEMICAL CO LTD V. ARKSTAR SHIP MANAGEMENT PTE LTD] should be stated as 'When both [the presence of an exclusion clause in a contract] and [the need to plead and prove the reasonableness of the clause under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap 71)] are present, the court should decide [that the party seeking to rely on the exclusion clause must plead and prove its reasonableness].' Omitting [the need to consider the public interest and reliance on charitable donations] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q, such as undermining public trust in contractual commitments to charitable donations and potentially harming the financial stability of the charity]. Indeed, the opinion in [CHIMBUSCO PAN NATION PETRO CHEMICAL CO LTD V. ARKSTAR SHIP MANAGEMENT PTE LTD] explicitly states that [the reasonableness of the exclusion clause must be pleaded and proved, which is crucial to ensuring fairness and transparency in contractual relationships].

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in [CHIMBUSCO PAN NATION PETRO CHEMICAL CO LTD V. ARKSTAR SHIP MANAGEMENT PTE LTD] was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties being bound by unreasonable and unfair contractual terms without proper justification]. However, in our current case, there's an additional risk of [undermining public trust in contractual commitments to charitable donations and potentially harming the financial stability of the charity, which was not a concern in the precedent case]. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not fully relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should consider the public interest and reliance on charitable donations when determining the enforceability of the exclusion clause and the modification of the donation terms.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the specific factor of the plaintiff's failure to plead and prove the reasonableness of the exclusion clause, which was present in the precedent case [CHIMBUSCO PAN NATION PETRO CHEMICAL CO LTD V. ARKSTAR SHIP MANAGEMENT PTE LTD], requiring this factor for all similar cases of exclusion clauses being challenged under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap 71) would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would undermine the enforcement of reasonable exclusion clauses that have been implicitly accepted by both parties through their conduct and the terms of the contract. Conversely, not requiring the explicit pleading and proof of reasonableness in every case would allow for the enforcement of exclusion clauses that are industry-standard and have been implicitly agreed upon, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, such as the freedom to contract and the enforcement of mutually agreed terms.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the specific factor of the plaintiff's failure to plead and prove the reasonableness of the exclusion clause, which was present in [CHIMBUSCO PAN NATION PETRO CHEMICAL CO LTD V. ARKSTAR SHIP MANAGEMENT PTE LTD], we have the additional factor of the public interest and reliance on charitable donations. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of the exclusion clause being challenged under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap 71), serves a similar function to the need for explicit pleading and proof of reasonableness in the precedent case. Given the presence of the public interest and reliance on charitable donations, we submit that the reasoning in [CHIMBUSCO PAN NATION PETRO CHEMICAL CO LTD V. ARKSTAR SHIP MANAGEMENT PTE LTD] still applies, as the positive effects on legal values, such as fairness, transparency, and the protection of public trust in contractual commitments, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to CHIMBUSCO PAN NATION PETRO CHEMICAL CO LTD V. ARKSTAR SHIP MANAGEMENT PTE LTD, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in the presence of exclusion clauses and the requirement to plead and prove their reasonableness under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap 71). However, it also differs significantly in the additional factor of public interest and reliance on charitable donations.

The proposed legal rule that the party seeking to rely on an exclusion clause must plead and prove its reasonableness finds support in both cases. However, the broader implications of this rule must be considered, especially in light of the public interest and reliance on charitable donations in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the need for fairness and transparency in contractual relationships (as argued in the precedent) and the potential harm to public trust and the financial stability of the charity (as argued in the current case).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, transparency, and the protection of parties from unreasonable and unfair contractual terms, as well as the public interest in maintaining trust in charitable commitments, we conclude that the court should require Care 2 U Ltd to plead and prove the reasonableness of the exclusion clause. If Care 2 U Ltd fails to do so, the exclusion clause should be deemed unenforceable, and Vulcanicity Ltd should not be precluded from claiming damages for the alleged damage to the equipment during transit.

Additionally, M-Scan Ltd should be held accountable for the promised donations to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation, as the charity has relied on these funds for its projects. The reduction in the donation percentage and the administrative burden argument do not outweigh the public interest and reliance on the promised funds.

Therefore, the final decision is that Care 2 U Ltd must plead and prove the reasonableness of the exclusion clause, and M-Scan Ltd must honor its original donation commitments to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency, particularly in protecting public trust and reliance on charitable commitments.


# Contract Law: Whether the reduction in the annual fee by M-Scan Ltd constitutes sufficient consideration for the change in the donation terms

## Deductive Reasoning: ca

### Relevant law:

CACV 170/2017 [2018] HKCA 107

### Major Premise:

1. CACV 170/2017 [2018] HKCA 107

   Conditions:
   - There is a variation of terms of employment.
   - The employee continues with the employment.
   - The continuance in employment provides a real benefit to the employer.

   Consequences:
   - The continuance in employment can provide consideration for the variation of terms of employment.

   Exceptions:
   - The continuance in employment does not provide a real benefit to the employer.

### Minor Premise:

1. CACV 170/2017 [2018] HKCA 107:
- There is a variation of terms of the contract between M-Scan Ltd and its customers, specifically the reduction in the donation to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation and the corresponding reduction in the annual fee.
- The existing customer base continues with the contract under the new terms.
- The continuance of the contract under the new terms provides a real benefit to M-Scan Ltd, as it reduces the administrative burden and potentially increases customer satisfaction.

### Conclusion:

CACV 170/2017 [2018] HKCA 107 applies, and the reduction in the annual fee by M-Scan Ltd constitutes sufficient consideration for the change in the donation terms. Therefore, the Albright Cancer Research Foundation cannot claim the promised revenue from M-Scan Ltd.

   Conditions:
   - An exclusion clause is included in the contract.
   - The exclusion clause is clear and unambiguous.
   - The exclusion clause has been properly incorporated into the contract.

   Consequences:
   - The exclusion clause will be enforceable.

   Exceptions:
   - The exclusion clause is not clear and unambiguous.
   - The exclusion clause has not been properly incorporated into the contract.
   - The exclusion clause is deemed unreasonable under the Unfair Contract Terms Ordinance (Cap. 71).

### Minor Premise:

1. Common law principles on exclusion clauses:
- An exclusion clause is included in the contract between M-Scan Ltd and its customers, stating that the carriers (Care 2 U Ltd) will not be liable for any damages during transportation if the user has not undertaken the recommended systems check and presented the results in writing.
- The exclusion clause is clear and unambiguous.
- The exclusion clause has been properly incorporated into the contract.
- Vulcanicity Ltd failed to undertake the recommended systems check before the scanner was collected.
- The exclusion clause is not deemed unreasonable under the Unfair Contract Terms Ordinance (Cap. 71).

### Conclusion:

The exclusion clause in the contract between M-Scan Ltd and its customers is enforceable. Therefore, Care 2 U Ltd can rely on the exclusion clause, and Vulcanicity Ltd cannot hold Care 2 U Ltd responsible for the damage discovered in transit.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK)

In the case of KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK [2021] HKCFI 2529; HCA 1254/2020 (precedent p), the court dealt with a breach of a consultancy service agreement. The plaintiff (P) sought summary judgment for outstanding service fees and future income loss. The defendant (D) opposed, claiming poor performance and repudiatory breach by P. The court ruled that summary judgment should only be granted in clear cases where there is no real or bona fide defence or triable issue. The court found that there were factual disputes and triable issues, thus denying the summary judgment.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Breach of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, there is an alleged breach of contract. In precedent p, P alleged that D breached the consultancy service agreement by not paying the service fees. In the current case, the Albright Cancer Research Foundation alleges that M-Scan Ltd breached the contract by unilaterally reducing the donation percentage.

- **Legal Concept 2: Consideration**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: The issue of whether the reduction in fees constitutes sufficient consideration. In precedent p, the court examined whether the reduction in service fees was justified. In the current case, M-Scan Ltd reduced the annual fee by 5% in recognition of the change in donation terms.

- **Legal Concept 3: Triable Issues**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: The presence of factual disputes that require a trial. In precedent p, the court identified several factual disputes and triable issues, such as the quality of P's performance and the terms of the agreement. In the current case, there are factual disputes regarding the promised revenue to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation and the exclusion clause in the contract between Vulcanicity Ltd and M-Scan Ltd.

- **Legal Concept 4: Exclusion Clauses**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: The enforceability of exclusion clauses. In precedent p, the court did not directly address exclusion clauses, but the principle of examining the terms of the contract is relevant. In the current case, Care 2 U Ltd relies on an exclusion clause to deny liability for damages during transportation.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK)

This suggests a general rule that when we see **fact pattern i*** (presence of factual disputes and triable issues), the court should decide **outcome o** (deny summary judgment and proceed to trial). This rule was justified in KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK because the positive effects (E+) of outcome o on the underlying values and principles of the law, such as ensuring a fair trial and thorough examination of all factual disputes, outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially delaying the resolution of the case.

In the current case, applying this rule means that the Albright Cancer Research Foundation can argue that the reduction in the annual fee by M-Scan Ltd does not constitute sufficient consideration for the change in donation terms, and that there are factual disputes and triable issues that require a trial. Similarly, Care 2 U Ltd can rely on the exclusion clause, but the enforceability of this clause should be examined in a trial due to the factual disputes regarding the systems check and the condition of the equipment.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Breach of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, there is an alleged breach of contract. In precedent p, P alleged that D breached the consultancy service agreement by not paying the service fees. In the current case, the Albright Cancer Research Foundation alleges that M-Scan Ltd breached the contract by unilaterally reducing the donation percentage.

- **Legal Concept 2: Consideration**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: The issue of whether the reduction in fees constitutes sufficient consideration. In precedent p, the court examined whether the reduction in service fees was justified. In the current case, M-Scan Ltd reduced the annual fee by 5% in recognition of the change in donation terms.

- **Legal Concept 3: Triable Issues**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: The presence of factual disputes that require a trial. In precedent p, the court identified several factual disputes and triable issues, such as the quality of P's performance and the terms of the agreement. In the current case, there are factual disputes regarding the promised revenue to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation and the exclusion clause in the contract between Vulcanicity Ltd and M-Scan Ltd.

- **Legal Concept 4: Exclusion Clauses**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: The enforceability of exclusion clauses. In precedent p, the court did not directly address exclusion clauses, but the principle of examining the terms of the contract is relevant. In the current case, Care 2 U Ltd relies on an exclusion clause to deny liability for damages during transportation.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome of denying summary judgment and proceeding to trial. This decision would be justified because, as in KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring a Fair Trial**: By allowing the case to proceed to trial, the court ensures that all factual disputes and triable issues are thoroughly examined, providing both parties with a fair opportunity to present their case.

2. **Thorough Examination of Factual Disputes**: The presence of factual disputes regarding the promised revenue to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation and the enforceability of the exclusion clause necessitates a detailed examination that can only be achieved through a trial.

3. **Upholding Contractual Obligations**: By scrutinizing the terms of the contract and the consideration provided, the court upholds the principle that contractual obligations should not be unilaterally altered without sufficient justification.

4. **Clarifying Legal Principles**: A trial would provide clarity on the enforceability of exclusion clauses and the sufficiency of consideration in contractual modifications, contributing to the development of contract law.

Given these positive effects, we submit that the court should deny summary judgment and allow the case to proceed to trial, ensuring a just and thorough resolution of the disputes.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, namely the specific exclusion clause in the contract between Vulcanicity Ltd and M-Scan Ltd, that was not present in [KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK]. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of triable issues and factual disputes.

In the precedent case, the court focused on the factual disputes and triable issues related to the performance and terms of the consultancy service agreement. However, in our current case, the exclusion clause specifically addresses the liability for damages during transportation, contingent upon the user undertaking the recommended systems check and presenting the results in writing.

Due to the presence of this exclusion clause, applying the same outcome of denying summary judgment and proceeding to trial would have more negative consequences, such as undermining the enforceability of clearly stipulated contractual terms. Unlike in [KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK], where the terms were broad and vague, the exclusion clause in our current case is specific and clear, providing a defined condition for liability.

Therefore, the presence of this exclusion clause significantly alters the balance of positive and negative effects, making it inappropriate to apply the same outcome as in the precedent case. The court should instead focus on the enforceability of the exclusion clause and whether Vulcanicity Ltd complied with the stipulated conditions, which may not necessitate a full trial if the clause is found to be clear and enforceable.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from [KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK] should be stated as "When both [the presence of factual disputes and triable issues] and [the existence of a specific exclusion clause] are present, the court should decide [to deny summary judgment and proceed to trial]." Omitting [the existence of a specific exclusion clause] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of undermining the enforceability of clearly stipulated contractual terms]. Indeed, the opinion in [KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK] explicitly states that [the court must not embark on a mini trial on affidavits and should ensure that all factual disputes are thoroughly examined, which implicitly includes examining the enforceability of specific contractual terms].

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in [KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK] was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of granting summary judgment in cases where there are genuine factual disputes and triable issues, thereby ensuring a fair trial]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [undermining the enforceability of clearly stipulated contractual terms] if the court focuses on the specific exclusion clause and its enforceability. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should examine the enforceability of the exclusion clause and whether Vulcanicity Ltd complied with the stipulated conditions, which may not necessitate a full trial if the clause is found to be clear and enforceable.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction

While it's true that our case lacks the specific exclusion clause factor, which was present in the precedent case [KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK], requiring this factor for all similar cases of factual disputes and triable issues would lead to the undesirable consequence of undermining the enforceability of clearly stipulated contractual terms. Conversely, not requiring the specific exclusion clause would allow for a more thorough examination of the factual disputes and triable issues, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, such as ensuring a fair trial and upholding contractual obligations.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution

Although our case lacks the specific exclusion clause factor, which was present in [KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK], we have the additional factor of the clear and specific terms of the exclusion clause in the contract between Vulcanicity Ltd and M-Scan Ltd. This clear and specific exclusion clause, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of factual disputes and triable issues, serves a similar function to the broad and vague terms in the precedent case. Given the presence of this clear and specific exclusion clause, we submit that the reasoning in [KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK] still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as ensuring a fair trial and upholding contractual obligations, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to [KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK], the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of factual disputes and triable issues, and the examination of contractual obligations and consideration. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the presence of a specific exclusion clause in the current case, which was not a factor in the precedent.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case, which suggests that summary judgment should be denied when there are factual disputes and triable issues, finds support in both cases. However, the broader implications of this rule must be considered, especially in light of the specific exclusion clause in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides. On one hand, the Albright Cancer Research Foundation argues that the reduction in the annual fee by M-Scan Ltd does not constitute sufficient consideration for the change in donation terms, and that there are factual disputes that require a trial. On the other hand, Care 2 U Ltd relies on the exclusion clause to deny liability for damages during transportation, arguing that the enforceability of this clause should be examined.

Considering the underlying legal principles of ensuring a fair trial, upholding contractual obligations, and the enforceability of clearly stipulated contractual terms, we conclude that the court should deny summary judgment and allow the case to proceed to trial. This decision aligns with the precedent set in [KWOK TAK WAI T/A PRIME SOLUTION CONSULTING CO v. WONG KA SEK], ensuring that all factual disputes and triable issues are thoroughly examined, providing both parties with a fair opportunity to present their case.

However, the court should also specifically examine the enforceability of the exclusion clause in the contract between Vulcanicity Ltd and M-Scan Ltd. If the clause is found to be clear and enforceable, it may not necessitate a full trial regarding the liability for damages during transportation.

In conclusion, the decision to deny summary judgment and proceed to trial is justified by the need to ensure a fair trial and thorough examination of all factual disputes, while also considering the enforceability of specific contractual terms. This approach serves justice and legal consistency, upholding the principles of contract law and providing clarity on the enforceability of exclusion clauses.

   - The standard form contract does not contain an express term allowing M-Scan Ltd to rescind or vary the contract without the Foundation’s consent.
   - The Foundation was not made aware of any term that would allow M-Scan Ltd to unilaterally change the donation terms.
   - M-Scan Ltd has not taken reasonable steps to make the Foundation aware of any such term.

### Conclusion:

Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 6 applies, and M-Scan Ltd may not, without the Albright Cancer Research Foundation’s consent, rescind or vary the contract to alter or extinguish the Foundation’s right to the promised donations. Therefore, the Albright Cancer Research Foundation can claim the promised revenue from M-Scan Ltd.

   - Vulcanicity Ltd failed to undertake the systems check before the scanner was collected.
   - The driver from Care 2 U Ltd did not recognize the difference in the paperwork, but this does not negate the condition precedent for the exclusion clause to apply.

### Conclusion:

Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 6 applies, and Care 2 U Ltd can rely on the exclusion clause in the contract between Vulcanicity Ltd and M-Scan Ltd, as the condition precedent (the systems check) was not fulfilled by Vulcanicity Ltd. Therefore, Care 2 U Ltd is not liable for any damages done during transportation, delivery, or return.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited)
In the case of Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited (precedent p), the court ruled that a carrier of goods shipped under a straight bill of lading is potentially liable for breach of contract or in conversion if it releases those goods without production of the original bill of lading. The court emphasized that the presentation rule is a cardinal purpose of the bill of lading contract, and any exemption clause must be construed strictly and clearly to exclude liability for such a fundamental breach.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Fundamental Obligation in Contract**: In Carewins, the fundamental obligation was the presentation rule for the bill of lading. In the current case, the fundamental obligation is the performance of a systems check before transportation.
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In Carewins, the carrier failed to adhere to the presentation rule. In the current case, Vulcanicity Ltd failed to perform the systems check.
- **Legal Concept 2: Exclusion Clauses**: In Carewins, the court scrutinized the exclusion clause to determine if it clearly exempted the carrier from liability. In the current case, Care 2 U Ltd relies on an exclusion clause to avoid liability for damages during transportation.
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In Carewins, the exclusion clause was not sufficiently clear to exempt the carrier from liability for a fundamental breach. In the current case, the exclusion clause is being tested for its clarity and applicability.
- **Legal Concept 3: Interpretation of Contract Terms**: In Carewins, the court applied the principle of contra proferentem to interpret the exclusion clause. In the current case, the same principle may be applied to interpret the exclusion clause in favor of Vulcanicity Ltd.
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In Carewins, the court interpreted the exclusion clause against the carrier. In the current case, the exclusion clause may be interpreted against Care 2 U Ltd if it is ambiguous.
- **Legal Concept 4: Notice and Modification of Contract Terms**: In Carewins, the court did not directly address modification of contract terms, but the principles of contract interpretation and fundamental obligations are relevant. In the current case, M-Scan Ltd has modified the terms of the donation to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation.
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In Carewins, the focus was on the fundamental obligation and exclusion clause. In the current case, the focus is on whether the notice given by M-Scan Ltd is sufficient to modify the contract terms.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fundamental obligation in a contract (fact pattern i*), the court should decide that any exclusion clause must be clear and unambiguous to exempt liability for a breach of that fundamental obligation (outcome o). This rule was justified in Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that fundamental contractual obligations are upheld and that exclusion clauses are interpreted strictly to protect the parties' reasonable expectations outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially limiting the scope of exclusion clauses in commercial contracts. This approach maintains the integrity of contractual obligations and provides clarity and fairness in commercial transactions.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Fundamental Obligation in Contract**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In Carewins, the fundamental obligation was the presentation rule for the bill of lading. In the current case, the fundamental obligation is the performance of a systems check before transportation. Vulcanicity Ltd failed to perform this systems check.

- **Legal Concept 2: Exclusion Clauses**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In Carewins, the court scrutinized the exclusion clause to determine if it clearly exempted the carrier from liability. In the current case, Care 2 U Ltd relies on an exclusion clause to avoid liability for damages during transportation. The exclusion clause states that the carriers will not be liable for any damages done during transportation, delivery, or return, where the user of the equipment has not undertaken the recommended systems check and presented the results in writing to both Care 2 U Ltd and M-Scan Ltd.

- **Legal Concept 3: Interpretation of Contract Terms**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In Carewins, the court applied the principle of contra proferentem to interpret the exclusion clause. In the current case, the same principle may be applied to interpret the exclusion clause in favor of Vulcanicity Ltd. The exclusion clause must be clear and unambiguous to exempt Care 2 U Ltd from liability.

- **Legal Concept 4: Notice and Modification of Contract Terms**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In Carewins, the focus was on the fundamental obligation and exclusion clause. In the current case, the focus is on whether the notice given by M-Scan Ltd is sufficient to modify the contract terms regarding the donation to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation. M-Scan Ltd has given notice to existing customers that the donation will cease and the annual donation will drop from 10 per cent to 5 per cent, with a corresponding reduction in the annual fee.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited. This decision would be justified because, as in Carewins, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Fundamental Contractual Obligations**: Ensuring that fundamental contractual obligations, such as the performance of a systems check before transportation, are upheld. This maintains the integrity and reliability of commercial contracts.

2. **Strict Interpretation of Exclusion Clauses**: Interpreting exclusion clauses strictly and clearly to protect the parties' reasonable expectations. This ensures that exclusion clauses do not unfairly exempt parties from liability for fundamental breaches of contract.

3. **Fairness and Clarity in Commercial Transactions**: Providing clarity and fairness in commercial transactions by ensuring that exclusion clauses are not used to negate essential contractual obligations. This promotes trust and confidence in commercial dealings.

4. **Protection of Third-Party Beneficiaries**: In the case of the Albright Cancer Research Foundation, ensuring that third-party beneficiaries are protected from unilateral changes to contract terms that significantly impact their expected benefits. This promotes fairness and accountability in contractual relationships involving third-party beneficiaries.

Therefore, applying the rule from Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited to the current case would ensure that the exclusion clause is interpreted strictly and that the fundamental obligation of performing a systems check is upheld. Additionally, the notice given by M-Scan Ltd regarding the change in donation terms should be scrutinized to ensure it is legally sufficient and does not unfairly impact the Albright Cancer Research Foundation.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the **presentation rule**. The presentation rule was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as upholding the integrity of the bill of lading system and protecting the shipper from fraud, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it maintained the fundamental purpose of the contract. However, in our current case, this crucial **presentation rule** is notably absent as the fundamental obligation in question is the performance of a systems check before transportation, not the presentation of a bill of lading.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor **(the modification of donation terms to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation)** that was not present in **Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by **i*** because it introduces the issue of whether a unilateral modification of contract terms, specifically regarding third-party beneficiaries, is legally permissible. Due to **the modification of donation terms**, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the trust and reliance of third-party beneficiaries on promised donations, which could lead to severe funding implications for the Albright Cancer Research Foundation. Unlike in **Carewins**, where the focus was on the fundamental obligation and exclusion clause within a commercial contract, our case involves the additional complexity of third-party beneficiary rights and the impact of contract modifications on those rights.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited** should be stated as 'When both [a fundamental obligation in a contract] and [the modification of contract terms affecting third-party beneficiaries] are present, the court should decide [that any exclusion clause must be clear and unambiguous to exempt liability for a breach of that fundamental obligation, and that unilateral modifications affecting third-party beneficiaries are not permissible without their consent].' Omitting [the modification of contract terms affecting third-party beneficiaries] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q], which is undermining the trust and reliance of third-party beneficiaries on promised benefits, potentially causing severe funding implications for organizations like the Albright Cancer Research Foundation. Indeed, the opinion in **Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited** explicitly states that [the fundamental obligation was crucial to their decision], and by analogy, the modification of contract terms affecting third-party beneficiaries is equally crucial in our current case.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of carriers avoiding liability for fundamental breaches of contract through ambiguous exclusion clauses]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [carriers avoiding liability for fundamental breaches through ambiguous exclusion clauses] occurring in the context of the donation modification. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the focus should be on ensuring that third-party beneficiaries, like the Albright Cancer Research Foundation, are protected from unilateral modifications that significantly impact their expected benefits.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the presentation rule, which was present in the precedent case Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited, requiring this factor for all similar cases of fundamental obligation in a contract would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would mean that exclusion clauses could be used to negate fundamental obligations in contracts where the presentation rule is not applicable, thereby undermining the integrity and reliability of commercial contracts. Conversely, not requiring the presentation rule would allow for a more consistent application of the principle that exclusion clauses must be clear and unambiguous to exempt liability for breaches of fundamental obligations. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which aim to uphold the parties' reasonable expectations and ensure fairness in commercial transactions.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the presentation rule, which was present in Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited, we have the additional factor of the modification of contract terms affecting third-party beneficiaries. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of a fundamental obligation in a contract and the use of an exclusion clause, serves a similar function to the presentation rule in the precedent case. Given the presence of the modification of contract terms affecting third-party beneficiaries, we submit that the reasoning in Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited still applies. The positive effects on legal values, such as upholding fundamental contractual obligations, ensuring strict interpretation of exclusion clauses, and protecting third-party beneficiaries, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **Carewins Development (China) Limited v Bright Fortune Shipping Limited**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of a fundamental obligation in a contract and the use of an exclusion clause. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of the presentation rule and the introduction of the modification of contract terms affecting third-party beneficiaries.

The proposed legal rule that any exclusion clause must be clear and unambiguous to exempt liability for a breach of a fundamental obligation finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in the context of third-party beneficiaries and unilateral contract modifications.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that exclusion clauses should be strictly interpreted to protect fundamental contractual obligations (as argued in the precedent) and the counterpoint that the modification of contract terms affecting third-party beneficiaries introduces additional complexities not present in the precedent case.

Considering the underlying legal principles of upholding fundamental contractual obligations, ensuring strict interpretation of exclusion clauses, and protecting third-party beneficiaries, we conclude that:

1. **Albright Cancer Research Foundation's Claim**: The Albright Cancer Research Foundation can claim the promised revenue from M-Scan Ltd. The unilateral modification of the donation terms without the consent of the third-party beneficiary (the Foundation) is not legally permissible. The notice given by M-Scan Ltd is insufficient to modify the contract terms affecting the Foundation's expected benefits, as it undermines the trust and reliance of the third-party beneficiary on the promised donations.

2. **Care 2 U Ltd's Reliance on the Exclusion Clause**: Care 2 U Ltd cannot rely on the exclusion clause in the contract between Vulcanicity Ltd and M-Scan Ltd to avoid liability for the damages done during transportation. The exclusion clause must be clear and unambiguous to exempt liability for a breach of a fundamental obligation. In this case, the fundamental obligation is the performance of a systems check before transportation. Given the ambiguity in the exclusion clause and the principle of contra proferentem, the clause should be interpreted against Care 2 U Ltd, holding them liable for the damages.

This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by ensuring that fundamental contractual obligations are upheld, exclusion clauses are strictly interpreted, and third-party beneficiaries are protected from unilateral modifications that significantly impact their expected benefits.

   Exceptions:
   - Subsections (2)(a) and (c) and (3) are subject to any express term of the contract specifying matters not available to the promisor by way of defence, set-off or counterclaim

### Minor Premise:

1. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 4 Subsections 1-3:
   - The contract between M-Scan Ltd and its customers includes a term that purports to confer a benefit on the Albright Cancer Research Foundation (10% of the annual fee and 1% of each booking).
   - The term is intended to be enforceable by the Albright Cancer Research Foundation as it is explicitly stated in the contract.

2. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 11 Subsection 2:
   - The Albright Cancer Research Foundation may enforce the term of the contract under section 4.
   - M-Scan Ltd has partly performed its obligations to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation by making donations in the past.
   - M-Scan Ltd is discharged from the obligations owed to the promisee (customers) to the extent of having performed the same obligations to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation.

3. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 11 Subsection 4:
   - The Albright Cancer Research Foundation may enforce the term of the contract under section 4.
   - There is no indication that the promisee (customers) has recovered any sum from M-Scan Ltd for the Albright Cancer Research Foundation’s loss or expenses.

4. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 8 Subsections 1-4:
   - The Albright Cancer Research Foundation may bring proceedings to enforce the term of the contract under section 4.
   - M-Scan Ltd may raise defences or set-offs that would have been available if the proceedings had been brought by the promisee (customers).

### Conclusion:

The Albright Cancer Research Foundation can claim the promised revenue from M-Scan Ltd under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 4. M-Scan Ltd's attempt to unilaterally reduce the donation percentage without the consent of the Albright Cancer Research Foundation is not enforceable, and the Foundation can seek to enforce the original terms of the contract.

Regarding Care 2 U Ltd, they can rely on the exclusion clause in the contract between Vulcanicity Ltd and M-Scan Ltd, provided that the conditions for the exclusion clause are met. Since Vulcanicity Ltd failed to undertake the recommended systems check, Care 2 U Ltd can invoke the exclusion clause to avoid liability for the damages during transportation.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (LIU HAO TSING EDUCATION FOUNDATION LTD AND ANOTHER v. LIU TIEH CHING BRANDON)
In the case of LIU HAO TSING EDUCATION FOUNDATION LTD AND ANOTHER v. LIU TIEH CHING BRANDON (precedent p), the plaintiffs sought to re-amend their Amended Statement of Claim to introduce a new claim for breach of contract, which was factually inconsistent with their existing claim based on conditions attached to a gift. The court ruled that the plaintiffs could not plead inconsistent factual alternatives when the facts were plainly within their knowledge, and thus, the proposed amendments were refused.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in LIU HAO TSING EDUCATION FOUNDATION LTD AND ANOTHER v. LIU TIEH CHING BRANDON and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Contractual Obligations and Amendments**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In the precedent case, the plaintiffs attempted to amend their claim to introduce a new contractual obligation. In the current case, M-Scan Ltd is attempting to amend the terms of their contract with their customers by reducing the donation percentage to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation.
- **Legal Concept 2: Reliance on Promised Revenue**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In the precedent case, the plaintiffs relied on the conditions set out in Liu Sr’s Statement. In the current case, the Albright Cancer Research Foundation relied on the promised donations from M-Scan Ltd for their funding allocations.
- **Legal Concept 3: Exclusion Clauses in Contracts**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In the precedent case, the court examined the enforceability of conditions attached to a gift. In the current case, Care 2 U Ltd is relying on an exclusion clause in the contract to avoid liability for damages during transportation.
- **Legal Concept 4: Good Faith and Tactical Manoeuvring**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In the precedent case, the court considered the plaintiffs' bad faith and tactical manoeuvring in attempting to amend their claim. In the current case, the Albright Cancer Research Foundation may argue that M-Scan Ltd’s unilateral amendment of the donation terms constitutes bad faith.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (LIU HAO TSING EDUCATION FOUNDATION LTD AND ANOTHER v. LIU TIEH CHING BRANDON)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern where a party attempts to amend a contract or claim in a way that introduces inconsistent factual alternatives or undermines reliance interests, the court should decide against allowing such amendments. This rule was justified in LIU HAO TSING EDUCATION FOUNDATION LTD AND ANOTHER v. LIU TIEH CHING BRANDON because the positive effects (E+) of maintaining consistency and protecting reliance interests on the underlying values and principles of the law outweigh the negative effects (E-) of allowing tactical manoeuvring and bad faith amendments. 

In the current case, applying this rule would mean that the Albright Cancer Research Foundation could argue that M-Scan Ltd’s attempt to amend the donation terms should not be allowed because it undermines the Foundation’s reliance on the promised revenue. Similarly, Care 2 U Ltd may not be able to rely on the exclusion clause if it is found that the clause was not properly communicated or if there was bad faith in its enforcement.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (LIU HAO TSING EDUCATION FOUNDATION LTD AND ANOTHER v. LIU TIEH CHING BRANDON) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Contractual Obligations and Amendments**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In the precedent case, the plaintiffs attempted to amend their claim to introduce a new contractual obligation. In the current case, M-Scan Ltd is attempting to amend the terms of their contract with their customers by reducing the donation percentage to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation.

- **Legal Concept 2: Reliance on Promised Revenue**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In the precedent case, the plaintiffs relied on the conditions set out in Liu Sr’s Statement. In the current case, the Albright Cancer Research Foundation relied on the promised donations from M-Scan Ltd for their funding allocations.

- **Legal Concept 3: Exclusion Clauses in Contracts**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In the precedent case, the court examined the enforceability of conditions attached to a gift. In the current case, Care 2 U Ltd is relying on an exclusion clause in the contract to avoid liability for damages during transportation.

- **Legal Concept 4: Good Faith and Tactical Manoeuvring**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In the precedent case, the court considered the plaintiffs' bad faith and tactical manoeuvring in attempting to amend their claim. In the current case, the Albright Cancer Research Foundation may argue that M-Scan Ltd’s unilateral amendment of the donation terms constitutes bad faith.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in LIU HAO TSING EDUCATION FOUNDATION LTD AND ANOTHER v. LIU TIEH CHING BRANDON. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Consistency in Contractual Obligations**: Just as the court in the precedent case refused to allow the plaintiffs to amend their claim to introduce inconsistent factual alternatives, the court in the current case should not allow M-Scan Ltd to unilaterally amend the donation terms. This maintains consistency in contractual obligations and prevents parties from altering agreed terms to the detriment of others.

2. **Protection of Reliance Interests**: The Albright Cancer Research Foundation has relied on the promised donations for their funding allocations. Allowing M-Scan Ltd to reduce the donation percentage would undermine this reliance, similar to how the court in the precedent case protected the reliance interests of the plaintiffs on the conditions set out in Liu Sr’s Statement.

3. **Enforceability of Exclusion Clauses**: The court in the precedent case examined the enforceability of conditions attached to a gift. Similarly, the court in the current case should scrutinize the exclusion clause relied upon by Care 2 U Ltd. If the clause was not properly communicated or if there was bad faith in its enforcement, it should not be upheld.

4. **Good Faith in Contractual Amendments**: The court in the precedent case considered the plaintiffs' bad faith and tactical manoeuvring. In the current case, the Albright Cancer Research Foundation can argue that M-Scan Ltd’s unilateral amendment of the donation terms constitutes bad faith, and the court should not permit such amendments.

Therefore, given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in LIU HAO TSING EDUCATION FOUNDATION LTD AND ANOTHER v. LIU TIEH CHING BRANDON. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the positive effects of maintaining consistency in contractual obligations, protecting reliance interests, ensuring the enforceability of exclusion clauses, and upholding good faith in contractual amendments.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **LIU HAO TSING EDUCATION FOUNDATION LTD AND ANOTHER v. LIU TIEH CHING BRANDON**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the plaintiffs were attempting to introduce a new contractual obligation that was factually inconsistent with their existing claim based on conditions attached to a gift. This inconsistency was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—maintaining consistency in pleadings and protecting reliance interests—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it prevented parties from altering agreed terms to the detriment of others and ensured that the facts within the parties' knowledge were accurately represented.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of introducing a factually inconsistent claim is notably absent. M-Scan Ltd is not introducing a new claim that is factually inconsistent with an existing one; rather, they are attempting to amend the terms of an existing contract by reducing the donation percentage to the Albright Cancer Research Foundation. This amendment does not involve a factual inconsistency but rather a modification of the terms of the contract, which is a different legal issue.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—**the reliance of a third party (the Albright Cancer Research Foundation) on the promised donations**—that was not present in **LIU HAO TSING EDUCATION FOUNDATION LTD AND ANOTHER v. LIU TIEH CHING BRANDON**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the Foundation has already allocated funds to projects based on the promised cash flow from M-Scan Ltd. Due to this reliance, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as severe funding implications for the Foundation, than positive ones, unlike in **LIU HAO TSING EDUCATION FOUNDATION LTD AND ANOTHER v. LIU TIEH CHING BRANDON**. The reliance of the Foundation on the promised donations introduces a new dimension of third-party reliance that was not considered in the precedent case, thereby altering the balance of positive and negative effects.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **LIU HAO TSING EDUCATION FOUNDATION LTD AND ANOTHER v. LIU TIEH CHING BRANDON** should be stated as: "When both [the attempt to amend a contract or claim in a way that introduces inconsistent factual alternatives] and [the reliance of a third party on the promised terms] are present, the court should decide [against allowing such amendments]." Omitting [the reliance of a third party on the promised terms] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of undermining third-party reliance interests, causing severe financial implications for the third party]. Indeed, the opinion in **LIU HAO TSING EDUCATION FOUNDATION LTD AND ANOTHER v. LIU TIEH CHING BRANDON** implicitly highlights the importance of protecting reliance interests, as the court refused to allow amendments that would undermine the plaintiffs' reliance on the conditions set out in Liu Sr’s Statement.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **LIU HAO TSING EDUCATION FOUNDATION LTD AND ANOTHER v. LIU TIEH CHING BRANDON** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of allowing parties to introduce inconsistent factual alternatives, thereby undermining the integrity of pleadings and reliance interests]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [introducing inconsistent factual alternatives]. Instead, the issue is [the unilateral amendment of contract terms that affect a third party's reliance on promised donations]. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—preventing inconsistent factual alternatives—is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the focus should be on protecting the reliance interests of the Albright Cancer Research Foundation, which were not a consideration in the precedent case.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of introducing a factually inconsistent claim, which was present in the precedent case **LIU HAO TSING EDUCATION FOUNDATION LTD AND ANOTHER v. LIU TIEH CHING BRANDON**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of unilateral amendments to contract terms would lead to the undesirable consequence of allowing parties to unilaterally alter agreed terms without considering the reliance interests of third parties. Conversely, not requiring the factor of introducing a factually inconsistent claim would allow for the desirable outcome of protecting third-party reliance interests, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, such as the enforcement of promises and the protection of reliance interests.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of introducing a factually inconsistent claim, which was present in **LIU HAO TSING EDUCATION FOUNDATION LTD AND ANOTHER v. LIU TIEH CHING BRANDON**, we have the additional factor of third-party reliance on the promised terms. This third-party reliance, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of unilateral amendments to contract terms, serves a similar function to the factor of introducing a factually inconsistent claim in the precedent case. Given the presence of third-party reliance, we submit that the reasoning in **LIU HAO TSING EDUCATION FOUNDATION LTD AND ANOTHER v. LIU TIEH CHING BRANDON** still applies, as the positive effects on protecting reliance interests and ensuring the enforceability of promises would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **LIU HAO TSING EDUCATION FOUNDATION LTD AND ANOTHER v. LIU TIEH CHING BRANDON**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the attempt to amend contractual obligations and the reliance on promised terms. However, it also differs significantly in that the current case involves the reliance of a third party (the Albright Cancer Research Foundation) on the promised donations, which was not a factor in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case—that the court should decide against allowing amendments that introduce inconsistent factual alternatives or undermine reliance interests—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the third-party reliance present in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of maintaining consistency in contractual obligations and protecting reliance interests (as argued by the Albright Cancer Research Foundation) against the absence of factually inconsistent claims in the current case (as argued by M-Scan Ltd).

Considering the underlying legal principles of contract law, such as the enforcement of promises and the protection of reliance interests, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the Albright Cancer Research Foundation should be able to claim the promised revenue from M-Scan Ltd. This decision aligns with the principle of protecting reliance interests, which is crucial in ensuring that third parties can trust and rely on promised terms in contracts.

Regarding Care 2 U Ltd and the exclusion clause, the court should scrutinize whether the clause was properly communicated and whether there was any bad faith in its enforcement. If the clause was not properly communicated or if there was bad faith, Care 2 U Ltd should not be able to rely on the exclusion clause to avoid liability for damages.

In conclusion, the key factors that influenced the outcome are the reliance of the Albright Cancer Research Foundation on the promised donations and the need to protect such reliance interests to ensure justice and legal consistency. Therefore, M-Scan Ltd should not be allowed to unilaterally amend the donation terms, and Care 2 U Ltd's reliance on the exclusion clause should be carefully examined for proper communication and good faith.

     - The third party’s loss in relation to the term; or
     - The expense to the promisee of making good to the third party the default of the promisor in relation to the term.

   Consequences:
   - In any proceedings brought under section 4 before a court or arbitral tribunal by the third party, the court or arbitral tribunal must reduce any award to the third party to the extent to which it thinks appropriate to take account of the sum.

   Exceptions:
   - None.

### Minor Premise:

1. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 6:
   - The Albright Cancer Research Foundation (ACRF) is a third party that may enforce the term of the contract under section 4.
   - M-Scan Ltd and its customers (the parties to the contract) have agreed to vary the contract by reducing the donation from 10% to 5% and ceasing the 1% per booking donation.
   - ACRF has relied on the term, and M-Scan Ltd can reasonably be expected to have foreseen that ACRF would rely on the term, as ACRF has already allocated funds to projects based on the promised cash flow.
   - There is no express term in the contract allowing M-Scan Ltd to vary the contract without ACRF’s consent, nor has ACRF been made aware of such a term.

2. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 11 Subsection 2:
   - ACRF is a third party that may enforce the term of the contract under section 4.
   - M-Scan Ltd has partly performed its obligations to ACRF by making donations based on the original terms of the contract.

3. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 11 Subsection 4:
   - ACRF is a third party that may enforce the term of the contract under section 4.
   - There is no indication that the promisee (M-Scan Ltd’s customers) has recovered any sum from M-Scan Ltd for ACRF’s loss or expenses.

### Conclusion:

Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance Cap. 623 Section 6 applies, and M-Scan Ltd may not rescind or vary the contract without the consent of the Albright Cancer Research Foundation. Therefore, ACRF can claim the promised revenue from M-Scan Ltd. 

As for Care 2 U Ltd, they can rely on the exclusion clause in the contract between Vulcanicity Ltd and M-Scan Ltd, provided that Vulcanicity Ltd failed to undertake the recommended systems check and present the results in writing, which is a condition precedent for the exclusion clause to apply.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA 219/2011 BETWEEN SIG CHINA INVESTMENTS ONE, LTD Plaintiff and LAM FUNG Defendant)
In the case of HCA 219/2011 BETWEEN SIG CHINA INVESTMENTS ONE, LTD Plaintiff and LAM FUNG Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the plaintiff, as a third party, was entitled to enforce the terms of the Investment Agreement under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act, Chapter 53B of Singapore. The court found that the plaintiff was sufficiently identified in the contract and that the contract conferred a benefit on the plaintiff, allowing them to exercise the Put Option.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA 219/2011 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Third-Party Beneficiary Rights**: In HCA 219/2011, the plaintiff was a third party who was allowed to enforce the terms of the contract. Similarly, in our current case, the Albright Cancer Research Foundation is a third party seeking to enforce the terms of the contract.
- **Express Identification in Contract**: In HCA 219/2011, the plaintiff was expressly identified in the contract. In our current case, the Albright Cancer Research Foundation is expressly identified in the contract as the recipient of donations.
- **Benefit Conferred by Contract**: In HCA 219/2011, the contract conferred a benefit on the plaintiff. In our current case, the contract confers a benefit on the Albright Cancer Research Foundation in the form of donations.
- **Enforcement of Contract Terms by Third Party**: In HCA 219/2011, the court allowed the third party to enforce the contract terms. In our current case, the Albright Cancer Research Foundation seeks to enforce the donation terms of the contract.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA 219/2011)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a third party being expressly identified in a contract and a benefit being conferred upon them, the court should decide that the third party is entitled to enforce the contract terms. This rule was justified in HCA 219/2011 because the positive effects of allowing third parties to enforce contract terms, such as upholding the parties' intentions and ensuring that the benefits conferred are realized, outweigh the negative effects, such as potential complications in contract enforcement.

Therefore, applying this rule to our current case, the Albright Cancer Research Foundation should be entitled to claim the promised revenue from M-Scan Ltd, as they are expressly identified in the contract and the contract confers a benefit upon them.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA 219/2011 BETWEEN SIG CHINA INVESTMENTS ONE, LTD Plaintiff and LAM FUNG Defendant) are present:

- **Third-Party Beneficiary Rights**: In HCA 219/2011, the plaintiff was a third party who was allowed to enforce the terms of the contract. Similarly, in our current case, the Albright Cancer Research Foundation is a third party seeking to enforce the terms of the contract.
- **Express Identification in Contract**: In HCA 219/2011, the plaintiff was expressly identified in the contract. In our current case, the Albright Cancer Research Foundation is expressly identified in the contract as the recipient of donations.
- **Benefit Conferred by Contract**: In HCA 219/2011, the contract conferred a benefit on the plaintiff. In our current case, the contract confers a benefit on the Albright Cancer Research Foundation in the form of donations.
- **Enforcement of Contract Terms by Third Party**: In HCA 219/2011, the court allowed the third party to enforce the contract terms. In our current case, the Albright Cancer Research Foundation seeks to enforce the donation terms of the contract.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome, allowing the Albright Cancer Research Foundation to claim the promised revenue from M-Scan Ltd. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA 219/2011, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding the Parties' Intentions**: The contract clearly intended to benefit the Albright Cancer Research Foundation by providing them with a percentage of the fees. Allowing the Foundation to enforce this term respects the original intentions of the contracting parties.
   
2. **Ensuring Realization of Benefits**: The Foundation has already allocated funds to projects based on the promised cash flow. Enforcing the contract terms ensures that the benefits conferred are realized, preventing financial harm to the Foundation and the projects it supports.

3. **Promoting Contractual Certainty**: Allowing third parties to enforce contract terms when they are expressly identified and conferred a benefit promotes certainty in contractual relationships. Parties can rely on the terms of the contract being upheld, which is crucial for planning and financial stability.

4. **Preventing Unjust Enrichment**: If M-Scan Ltd were allowed to unilaterally reduce the donations without consequence, it would result in unjust enrichment at the expense of the Foundation. Enforcing the original terms prevents this unfair outcome.

Therefore, applying the rule from HCA 219/2011 to our current case, the Albright Cancer Research Foundation should be entitled to claim the promised revenue from M-Scan Ltd. This decision would be justified because it upholds the underlying values and principles of contract law, ensuring fairness, certainty, and the realization of intended benefits.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA 219/2011 BETWEEN SIG CHINA INVESTMENTS ONE, LTD Plaintiff and LAM FUNG Defendant, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the third party (SIG China Investments One, Ltd) was expressly identified in the contract and the contract conferred a specific benefit on them. This express identification and benefit were key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as upholding the parties' intentions and ensuring that the benefits conferred are realized, outweighed any potential drawbacks, such as potential complications in contract enforcement. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of express identification and specific benefit is notably absent as the Albright Cancer Research Foundation is not expressly identified in the contract as a party entitled to enforce the donation terms. The contract merely mentions the donation to the Foundation without explicitly granting them enforcement rights.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the presence of an exclusion clause, that was not present in HCA 219/2011 BETWEEN SIG CHINA INVESTMENTS ONE, LTD Plaintiff and LAM FUNG Defendant. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of third-party beneficiary rights. Because of the exclusion clause, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences than positive ones. The exclusion clause in the contract between Vulcanicity Ltd and M-Scan Ltd specifically limits the liability of Care 2 U Ltd for any damages done during transportation, delivery, or return, provided that the user of the equipment has not undertaken the recommended systems check. This clause introduces a layer of complexity that was not present in the precedent case, where the enforcement of contract terms by a third party was more straightforward. Due to the exclusion clause, enforcing the same outcome would lead to potential unfairness and legal complications, as it would disregard the agreed-upon limitations of liability and the conditions under which they apply.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA 219/2011 BETWEEN SIG CHINA INVESTMENTS ONE, LTD Plaintiff and LAM FUNG Defendant should be stated as: "When both the third party is expressly identified in the contract and the contract confers a specific benefit on them, the court should decide that the third party is entitled to enforce the contract terms." Omitting the express identification of the third party from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of creating uncertainty and potential disputes over who is entitled to enforce the contract terms. Indeed, the opinion in HCA 219/2011 explicitly states that the express identification of the third party was crucial to their decision, as it provided clarity and certainty regarding the parties' intentions and the benefits conferred.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA 219/2011 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of uncertainty and potential disputes over the enforcement of contract terms by third parties. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because the Albright Cancer Research Foundation is expressly identified in the contract as the recipient of donations. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be appropriate, as the very purpose it serves—ensuring clarity and certainty in the enforcement of contract terms by third parties—is relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the express identification of the Albright Cancer Research Foundation as a party entitled to enforce the donation terms, which was present in the precedent case HCA 219/2011 BETWEEN SIG CHINA INVESTMENTS ONE, LTD Plaintiff and LAM FUNG Defendant, requiring this factor for all similar cases of third-party beneficiary rights would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would allow contracting parties to unilaterally alter or terminate benefits conferred upon third parties without any recourse for those third parties, even when the contract clearly intended to benefit them. Conversely, not requiring express identification would allow for the enforcement of intended benefits by third parties, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, such as upholding the parties' intentions and ensuring fairness.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the express identification of the Albright Cancer Research Foundation as a party entitled to enforce the donation terms, which was present in HCA 219/2011, we have the additional factor of the Foundation being explicitly named as the recipient of the donations in the contract. This explicit naming, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of the contract conferring a benefit on the third party, serves a similar function to express identification in the precedent case. Given the presence of this explicit naming, we submit that the reasoning in HCA 219/2011 still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as upholding the parties' intentions and ensuring the realization of conferred benefits, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA 219/2011 BETWEEN SIG CHINA INVESTMENTS ONE, LTD Plaintiff and LAM FUNG Defendant, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the third-party beneficiary rights, express identification in the contract, and the benefit conferred by the contract. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the presence of an exclusion clause in the contract between Vulcanicity Ltd and M-Scan Ltd, and the fact that the Albright Cancer Research Foundation is not expressly identified as a party entitled to enforce the donation terms.

The proposed legal rule of allowing third parties to enforce contract terms when they are expressly identified and conferred a benefit finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the Albright Cancer Research Foundation is explicitly named as the recipient of donations, which serves a similar function to express identification, and the counterargument that the exclusion clause introduces a layer of complexity not present in the precedent case.

Considering the underlying legal principles of upholding the parties' intentions, ensuring the realization of conferred benefits, and promoting contractual certainty, we conclude that the Albright Cancer Research Foundation should be entitled to claim the promised revenue from M-Scan Ltd. This decision aligns with the precedent set in HCA 219/2011, as the Foundation is explicitly named in the contract and the contract confers a specific benefit upon them. The positive effects of upholding the parties' intentions and ensuring the realization of benefits outweigh the potential negative consequences of not having express identification.

Regarding Care 2 U Ltd and the exclusion clause, the clause clearly limits their liability for any damages done during transportation, delivery, or return, provided that the user of the equipment has not undertaken the recommended systems check. Since Vulcanicity Ltd failed to undertake the systems check, Care 2 U Ltd can rely on the exclusion clause to limit their liability. This decision respects the agreed-upon limitations of liability and the conditions under which they apply, promoting fairness and legal consistency.

In conclusion, the Albright Cancer Research Foundation can claim the promised revenue from M-Scan Ltd, and Care 2 U Ltd can rely on the exclusion clause in the contract between Vulcanicity Ltd and M-Scan Ltd. This decision is reached by balancing the considerations of legal precedent, justice, and legal consistency, ensuring that the underlying principles of contract law are upheld.
