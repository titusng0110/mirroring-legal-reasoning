Shanghai Tongji Science & Technology Industrial Company Limited v Casil Clearing Limited

### Major Premise:

1. Shanghai Tongji Science & Technology Industrial Company Limited v Casil Clearing Limited

   Conditions:
   - The conduct of the parties is such that it would be reasonably understood by a reasonable person in the position of the other party as an offer to enter into a contract.
   - The conduct of the other party is such that it would be reasonably understood by a reasonable person in the position of the first party as an acceptance of that offer.
   - The conduct relied upon is unequivocally referable to the contract sought to be inferred and inconsistent with there being no such contract.

   Consequences:
   - A legally binding contract may be inferred from the conduct of the parties.

   Exceptions:
   - The conduct is equally consistent with there being no contract.
   - One party knows that the other party does not intend to be bound by the terms alleged.

2. Shanghai Tongji Science & Technology Industrial Company Limited v Casil Clearing Limited

   Conditions:
   - The conduct of the parties, viewed objectively, indicates that they have reached an agreement on the same terms on the same subject-matter.
   - The conduct is consistent only with there being a contract implied, and inconsistent with there being no such contract.

   Consequences:
   - A legally binding contract may be inferred from the conduct of the parties.

   Exceptions:
   - The conduct relied upon is no more consistent with an intention to contract than with an intention not to contract.
   - One party knows that the other party does not intend to be bound by the terms alleged.

### Minor Premise:

1. Shanghai Tongji Science & Technology Industrial Company Limited v Casil Clearing Limited:

   - The conduct of Wong Kee and Neptune is such that it would be reasonably understood by a reasonable person in the position of the other party as an offer to enter into a contract. Wong Kee consistently ordered crabs, and Neptune consistently supplied them.
   - The conduct of Neptune is such that it would be reasonably understood by a reasonable person in the position of Wong Kee as an acceptance of that offer. Neptune continued to supply crabs as per the orders.
   - The conduct relied upon is unequivocally referable to the contract sought to be inferred and inconsistent with there being no such contract. The dealings were regular and followed a specific pattern, including the delivery of crabs on the next Monday following the order.

   - The conduct is not equally consistent with there being no contract. The regularity and specificity of the dealings indicate a contractual relationship.
   - There is no evidence that one party knew the other did not intend to be bound by the terms alleged.

2. Shanghai Tongji Science & Technology Industrial Company Limited v Casil Clearing Limited:

   - The conduct of Wong Kee and Neptune, viewed objectively, indicates that they have reached an agreement on the same terms on the same subject-matter. The terms were consistent with the draft contract, and the dealings continued in the same manner.
   - The conduct is consistent only with there being a contract implied, and inconsistent with there being no such contract. The dealings were regular, and the terms were clear and followed by both parties.

   - The conduct relied upon is more consistent with an intention to contract than with an intention not to contract. The regular orders and deliveries indicate an intention to be bound by the terms.
   - There is no evidence that one party knew the other did not intend to be bound by the terms alleged.

### Conclusion:

A legally binding contract may be inferred from the conduct of Wong Kee and Neptune despite the absence of a signed agreement.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (T&T GLOBAL TRADING LTD v. BOE (HK) GROUP CO., LTD)
In the case of T&T GLOBAL TRADING LTD v. BOE (HK) GROUP CO., LTD (precedent p), the court ruled that despite the presence of an "entire agreement clause" in the 2nd Invoice, there was a subsequent mutual agreement or variation that dispensed with the requirement of a top-up deposit. The court found that the parties' conduct and communications indicated a waiver of the top-up deposit requirement, thus creating a binding variation to the original terms.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in T&T GLOBAL TRADING LTD v. BOE (HK) GROUP CO., LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Entire Agreement Clause**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In T&T GLOBAL, the 2nd Invoice contained an entire agreement clause, yet the court found a subsequent mutual agreement that varied the terms. In our current case, the amended agreement sent by Neptune to Wong Kee also contains an entire agreement clause.
- **Legal Concept 2: Conduct and Communications Indicating Variation**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In T&T GLOBAL, the conduct and communications between the parties indicated a waiver of the top-up deposit requirement. In our current case, the continued transactions between Wong Kee and Neptune, despite the absence of a signed agreement, indicate an acceptance of the terms proposed by Neptune.
- **Legal Concept 3: Part Performance**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In T&T GLOBAL, the court considered the part performance of the contract (partial delivery of goods) as evidence of a binding agreement. In our current case, Neptune continued to supply crabs to Wong Kee, and Wong Kee continued to accept and pay for them, indicating part performance.
- **Legal Concept 4: Objective Assessment of Intent to Create Legal Relations**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In T&T GLOBAL, the court assessed the intent to create legal relations objectively based on the parties' conduct and communications. In our current case, the objective assessment of the continued dealings between Wong Kee and Neptune suggests an intent to be bound by the terms of the amended agreement.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (T&T GLOBAL TRADING LTD v. BOE (HK) GROUP CO., LTD)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of an entire agreement clause being present, but the parties' conduct and communications indicating a variation or mutual agreement, the court should decide that the variation is binding. This rule was justified in T&T GLOBAL TRADING LTD v. BOE (HK) GROUP CO., LTD because the positive effects (E+) of recognizing the parties' true intent and ensuring fairness in commercial dealings outweighed the negative effects (E-) of potentially undermining the entire agreement clause. This rule ensures that the law respects the practical realities of business transactions and the genuine intentions of the parties involved.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (T&T GLOBAL TRADING LTD v. BOE (HK) GROUP CO., LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Entire Agreement Clause**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In T&T GLOBAL, the 2nd Invoice contained an entire agreement clause, yet the court found a subsequent mutual agreement that varied the terms. In our current case, the amended agreement sent by Neptune to Wong Kee also contains an entire agreement clause.

- **Legal Concept 2: Conduct and Communications Indicating Variation**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In T&T GLOBAL, the conduct and communications between the parties indicated a waiver of the top-up deposit requirement. In our current case, the continued transactions between Wong Kee and Neptune, despite the absence of a signed agreement, indicate an acceptance of the terms proposed by Neptune.

- **Legal Concept 3: Part Performance**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In T&T GLOBAL, the court considered the part performance of the contract (partial delivery of goods) as evidence of a binding agreement. In our current case, Neptune continued to supply crabs to Wong Kee, and Wong Kee continued to accept and pay for them, indicating part performance.

- **Legal Concept 4: Objective Assessment of Intent to Create Legal Relations**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In T&T GLOBAL, the court assessed the intent to create legal relations objectively based on the parties' conduct and communications. In our current case, the objective assessment of the continued dealings between Wong Kee and Neptune suggests an intent to be bound by the terms of the amended agreement.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in T&T GLOBAL TRADING LTD v. BOE (HK) GROUP CO., LTD. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Recognition of Parties' True Intent**: By acknowledging the continued dealings and the acceptance of the terms proposed by Neptune, the court would be recognizing the true intent of the parties to be bound by the amended agreement, despite the absence of a formal signature. This respects the practical realities of business transactions where formalities may sometimes be overlooked but the intent to create legal relations remains clear.

2. **Ensuring Fairness in Commercial Dealings**: Upholding the binding nature of the agreement based on the parties' conduct and communications ensures fairness. Wong Kee relied on Neptune's supply of crabs for its business, and Neptune continued to supply crabs based on the terms it proposed. It would be unfair to allow Neptune to unilaterally alter the terms (such as supplying only baby crabs) without consequence.

3. **Commercial Certainty**: This decision would promote commercial certainty by reinforcing that parties cannot escape their obligations simply due to a lack of formal signature when their conduct clearly indicates an agreement. This is crucial for businesses to plan and operate effectively.

4. **Respecting Established Trade Practices**: The decision would also respect the established norms and practices of the seafood trade in Hong Kong, which both parties adhered to during their dealings. This reinforces the binding nature of industry standards and practices in commercial contracts.

Therefore, the court should find that there was a binding contract between Wong Kee and Neptune, despite the absence of a signed agreement, based on the parties' conduct, communications, and part performance. This outcome aligns with the principles established in T&T GLOBAL TRADING LTD v. BOE (HK) GROUP CO., LTD and ensures fairness, recognition of true intent, commercial certainty, and respect for trade practices.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the "Seller’s Liability" provision, that was not present in T&T GLOBAL TRADING LTD v. BOE (HK) GROUP CO., LTD. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of the entire agreement clause and the conduct indicating variation. The "Seller’s Liability" provision in our current case explicitly excludes all liability for any loss or damage arising from any defect in any seafood product supplied, however caused. This provision could potentially conflict with the implied terms of quality and fitness for purpose that might otherwise be inferred from the parties' conduct and communications.

Due to the presence of the "Seller’s Liability" provision, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the protection typically afforded to buyers under implied terms of quality and fitness for purpose. Unlike in T&T GLOBAL TRADING LTD v. BOE (HK) GROUP CO., LTD, where the court found a mutual agreement or variation that was beneficial to both parties, the "Seller’s Liability" provision in our case could lead to an unfair situation where Wong Kee is left without recourse for receiving substandard crabs, despite the continued dealings and part performance indicating an agreement. This significantly alters the balance of positive and negative effects, making it inappropriate to apply the same outcome as in the precedent case.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from T&T GLOBAL TRADING LTD v. BOE (HK) GROUP CO., LTD should be stated as: "When both the fact pattern of an entire agreement clause being present and the parties' conduct and communications indicating a variation or mutual agreement are present, the court should decide that the variation is binding, unless there is a specific exclusion of liability clause that significantly alters the balance of obligations and protections between the parties." Omitting the specific exclusion of liability clause from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of undermining the protection typically afforded to buyers under implied terms of quality and fitness for purpose. Indeed, the opinion in T&T GLOBAL TRADING LTD v. BOE (HK) GROUP CO., LTD explicitly states that the mutual agreement or variation was crucial to their decision, but it did not involve an exclusion of liability clause that could significantly alter the parties' obligations and protections.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in T&T GLOBAL TRADING LTD v. BOE (HK) GROUP CO., LTD was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of ignoring the true intent and practical realities of business transactions where parties' conduct and communications indicate a mutual agreement or variation. However, in our current case, there's a significant risk of an undesirable consequence occurring due to the presence of the "Seller’s Liability" provision. This provision explicitly excludes all liability for any loss or damage arising from any defect in any seafood product supplied, which could leave Wong Kee without recourse for receiving substandard crabs. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—to recognize mutual agreements and variations based on conduct and communications—does not account for the significant alteration of obligations and protections introduced by the exclusion of liability clause.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the specific exclusion of liability clause (factor m), which was present in the precedent case T&T GLOBAL TRADING LTD v. BOE (HK) GROUP CO., LTD, requiring this factor for all similar cases of entire agreement clauses and conduct indicating variation would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would allow parties to escape their obligations by inserting broad exclusion clauses, thereby undermining the practical realities of business transactions and the genuine intentions of the parties involved. Conversely, not requiring the exclusion of liability clause would allow for a more balanced approach that respects the true intent of the parties and ensures fairness in commercial dealings. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which aim to uphold the reasonable expectations of honest businessmen and ensure that agreements are honored based on the parties' conduct and communications.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the specific exclusion of liability clause (factor m), which was present in T&T GLOBAL TRADING LTD v. BOE (HK) GROUP CO., LTD, we have the additional factor of established trade practices and norms (factor n). This factor n, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of an entire agreement clause and conduct indicating variation, serves a similar function to factor m in the precedent case. Given the presence of established trade practices and norms, we submit that the reasoning in T&T GLOBAL TRADING LTD v. BOE (HK) GROUP CO., LTD still applies. The positive effects on legal values, such as recognizing the true intent of the parties, ensuring fairness, and promoting commercial certainty, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. The established trade practices provide a clear framework for the distribution of crab sizes, which both parties adhered to, reinforcing the binding nature of their agreement despite the absence of a formal signature.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to T&T GLOBAL TRADING LTD v. BOE (HK) GROUP CO., LTD, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of an entire agreement clause, conduct and communications indicating a variation, part performance, and an objective assessment of intent to create legal relations. However, it also differs in the significant presence of a "Seller’s Liability" provision in the current case, which was not present in the precedent.

The proposed legal rule from T&T GLOBAL TRADING LTD v. BOE (HK) GROUP CO., LTD—that a variation is binding when the fact pattern of an entire agreement clause being present and the parties' conduct and communications indicating a variation or mutual agreement are present—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the "Seller’s Liability" provision in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the continued dealings and part performance indicate an acceptance of the terms proposed by Neptune, and the counterargument that the "Seller’s Liability" provision significantly alters the balance of obligations and protections between the parties.

Considering the underlying legal principles of recognizing the true intent of the parties, ensuring fairness in commercial dealings, and promoting commercial certainty, we conclude that there was a binding contract between Wong Kee and Neptune, despite the absence of a signed agreement. This decision aligns with the principles established in T&T GLOBAL TRADING LTD v. BOE (HK) GROUP CO., LTD and ensures fairness, recognition of true intent, commercial certainty, and respect for trade practices.

However, the "Seller’s Liability" provision must be scrutinized separately to ensure it does not unfairly prejudice Wong Kee. The court should consider whether this provision is enforceable in light of the implied terms of quality and fitness for purpose that might otherwise be inferred from the parties' conduct and communications. If the provision is found to be overly broad or unfair, it may be subject to limitation or exclusion under relevant consumer protection laws or principles of fairness in contract law.

In conclusion, the court should find that there was a binding contract between Wong Kee and Neptune based on the parties' conduct, communications, and part performance, while also carefully examining the enforceability of the "Seller’s Liability" provision to ensure it does not result in an unjust outcome.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA012172/1996)
In the case of HCA012172/1996 between Safe Steel Furniture Factory Limited (Plaintiff) and Lamex Trading Company Limited (Defendant), the court ruled that the agreement between the parties was not for an indefinite term. The court found that the provisions of the agreement, including the minimum quantity of goods to be manufactured and ordered, were only applicable up to 1994. The court also held that any implied term suggesting that the agreement would continue indefinitely was void for uncertainty. Therefore, the agreement could not be extended beyond the specified period without a clear mechanism for determining essential terms such as quantity and price.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA012172/1996 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Duration of Agreement**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (Precedent):** The agreement did not specify a duration beyond 1994, leading to a dispute over whether it was for an indefinite term.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (Current Case):** The draft contract between Wong Kee and Neptune was not signed, leading to a dispute over whether the terms proposed by Neptune are enforceable.

- **Legal Concept 2: Implied Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (Precedent):** The plaintiff argued for an implied term that the agreement would continue indefinitely, which the court found void for uncertainty.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (Current Case):** Wong Kee may argue that the terms proposed by Neptune, including the minimum quantity and composition clauses, were impliedly accepted through continued performance.

- **Legal Concept 3: Minimum Quantity and Composition Clauses**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (Precedent):** The agreement specified minimum quantities of goods to be manufactured and ordered, which were essential terms.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (Current Case):** Neptune's proposed contract included a minimum quantity clause and a composition clause, which are essential terms for the supply of crabs.

- **Legal Concept 4: Exclusion of Liability**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (Precedent):** The agreement included specific remedies and exclusions for breaches of contract.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (Current Case):** Neptune's proposed contract includes a "Seller’s Liability" provision excluding liability for defects in the seafood supplied.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA012172/1996)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern involving an agreement with essential terms such as minimum quantity and composition, and where the agreement is not formally executed but performance continues, the court should decide that the terms are not enforceable if they are void for uncertainty or lack a clear mechanism for determination. This rule was justified in HCA012172/1996 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring contractual certainty and preventing indefinite obligations without clear terms outweighed the negative effects (E-) of potentially disrupting ongoing business relationships. Therefore, in our current case, the terms proposed by Neptune, including the 'minimum quantity' clause, 'composition' clause, and 'Seller’s Liability' provision, should not be enforceable if they are found to be void for uncertainty or lack a clear mechanism for determination.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA012172/1996) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Duration of Agreement**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (Precedent):** The agreement did not specify a duration beyond 1994, leading to a dispute over whether it was for an indefinite term.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (Current Case):** The draft contract between Wong Kee and Neptune was not signed, leading to a dispute over whether the terms proposed by Neptune are enforceable.

- **Legal Concept 2: Implied Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (Precedent):** The plaintiff argued for an implied term that the agreement would continue indefinitely, which the court found void for uncertainty.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (Current Case):** Wong Kee may argue that the terms proposed by Neptune, including the minimum quantity and composition clauses, were impliedly accepted through continued performance.

- **Legal Concept 3: Minimum Quantity and Composition Clauses**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (Precedent):** The agreement specified minimum quantities of goods to be manufactured and ordered, which were essential terms.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (Current Case):** Neptune's proposed contract included a minimum quantity clause and a composition clause, which are essential terms for the supply of crabs.

- **Legal Concept 4: Exclusion of Liability**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (Precedent):** The agreement included specific remedies and exclusions for breaches of contract.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (Current Case):** Neptune's proposed contract includes a "Seller’s Liability" provision excluding liability for defects in the seafood supplied.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCA012172/1996. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Contractual Certainty:** Just as in HCA012172/1996, enforcing terms that are void for uncertainty or lack a clear mechanism for determination would undermine the principle of contractual certainty. By not enforcing the terms proposed by Neptune, the court would uphold the importance of having clear and definite terms in a contract, thereby providing predictability and stability in commercial transactions.

2. **Preventing Indefinite Obligations:** Similar to the precedent case, enforcing an agreement with indefinite terms could lead to perpetual obligations without clear boundaries. This would be unfair to the parties involved and could result in ongoing disputes. By ruling that the terms are not enforceable, the court would prevent such indefinite obligations and encourage parties to formalize their agreements with clear and specific terms.

3. **Encouraging Proper Contract Formation:** The decision would reinforce the importance of proper contract formation, including the necessity of signing and returning contracts to indicate acceptance. This would promote better business practices and reduce the likelihood of disputes arising from informal or incomplete agreements.

4. **Balancing Interests:** While Wong Kee may suffer from the non-enforcement of the terms, the overall positive effect of maintaining clear and enforceable contractual terms outweighs the negative impact. This approach ensures that both parties are aware of their rights and obligations, leading to fairer and more transparent business dealings.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCA012172/1996. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the positive effects of ensuring contractual certainty, preventing indefinite obligations, encouraging proper contract formation, and balancing the interests of the parties involved.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case

In the precedent case HCA012172/1996, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the agreement explicitly specified the minimum quantities of goods to be manufactured and ordered up to 1994. This specification was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—such as contractual certainty and preventing indefinite obligations—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided a clear mechanism for determining essential terms like quantity and price. However, in our current case, this crucial feature of explicitly specified minimum quantities is notably absent. The draft contract between Wong Kee and Neptune was not signed, and there was no formal agreement specifying the minimum quantities or other essential terms beyond the informal and ongoing business relationship.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case

Our current case involves an important factor—the continued performance and acceptance of terms through conduct—that was not present in HCA012172/1996. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because, in our case, Wong Kee and Neptune continued their business relationship under the terms proposed in the draft contract, even though it was not formally signed. Due to this continued performance and acceptance through conduct, applying the same outcome as in HCA012172/1996 would have more negative consequences, such as undermining the principle of implied acceptance through conduct and disrupting ongoing business relationships, than positive ones. Unlike in HCA012172/1996, where the absence of a formal agreement beyond 1994 led to a clear conclusion, the ongoing and consistent performance in our case suggests that the parties had effectively accepted the terms through their conduct, thereby making those terms enforceable.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from HCA012172/1996 should be stated as: "When both the shared fact pattern of an agreement with essential terms such as minimum quantity and composition, and the missing feature of continued performance and acceptance through conduct are present, the court should decide that the terms are enforceable." Omitting the feature of continued performance and acceptance through conduct from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of undermining the principle of implied acceptance through conduct and disrupting ongoing business relationships. Indeed, the opinion in HCA012172/1996 explicitly states that the absence of a formal agreement beyond 1994 led to a clear conclusion, highlighting the importance of having a formal mechanism for determining essential terms. However, in our current case, the continued performance and acceptance through conduct suggest that the parties had effectively accepted the terms, making those terms enforceable.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in HCA012172/1996 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of indefinite obligations without clear terms, which could lead to ongoing disputes and uncertainty in commercial relationships. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because the continued performance and acceptance through conduct provide a clear indication that the parties had accepted the terms proposed in the draft contract. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The ongoing and consistent performance between Wong Kee and Neptune indicates that the terms, including the 'minimum quantity' clause, 'composition' clause, and 'Seller’s Liability' provision, should be considered enforceable.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the explicit specification of minimum quantities beyond a certain period, which was present in the precedent case HCA012172/1996, requiring this factor for all similar cases of agreements with essential terms such as minimum quantity and composition would lead to the undesirable consequence of undermining the principle of implied acceptance through conduct. Conversely, not requiring the explicit specification of minimum quantities would allow for the recognition of continued performance and acceptance through conduct, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, such as the intention of the parties and the practical realities of ongoing business relationships.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the explicit specification of minimum quantities beyond a certain period, which was present in HCA012172/1996, we have the additional factor of continued performance and acceptance through conduct. This continued performance and acceptance through conduct, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of an agreement with essential terms such as minimum quantity and composition, serves a similar function to the explicit specification of terms in the precedent case. Given the presence of continued performance and acceptance through conduct, we submit that the reasoning in HCA012172/1996 still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as ensuring contractual certainty, preventing indefinite obligations, and encouraging proper contract formation would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA012172/1996, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of essential terms like minimum quantity and composition, and the issue of whether an agreement can be considered enforceable without formal execution. However, it also differs significantly in that the current case involves continued performance and acceptance through conduct, which was not present in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule from HCA012172/1996—that terms are not enforceable if they are void for uncertainty or lack a clear mechanism for determination—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the continued performance and acceptance through conduct in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point from the precedent case that contractual certainty and prevention of indefinite obligations are crucial, and the strong point from the current case that continued performance and acceptance through conduct should be recognized as implying acceptance of terms.

Considering the underlying legal principles of ensuring contractual certainty, preventing indefinite obligations, encouraging proper contract formation, and recognizing implied acceptance through conduct, we conclude that the terms proposed by Neptune, including the 'minimum quantity' clause, 'composition' clause, and 'Seller’s Liability' provision, should be considered enforceable. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by acknowledging the practical realities of ongoing business relationships and the implied acceptance through continued performance.

Therefore, the terms proposed by Neptune in the draft contract are enforceable, given the continued performance and acceptance through conduct by Wong Kee. This conclusion ensures that both parties are aware of their rights and obligations, leading to fairer and more transparent business dealings.

Therefore, Neptune cannot rely on this clause to avoid liability for the financial losses suffered by Wong Kee due to the delivery of baby mud crabs.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCCL 27/2008 MAU WING INDUSTRIAL LIMITED v ENSIGN FREIGHT PTE LIMITED)
In the case of HCCL 27/2008 MAU WING INDUSTRIAL LIMITED v ENSIGN FREIGHT PTE LIMITED (precedent p), the court ruled that the contractual carrier (1st defendant) was liable for the breach of the contract of carriage and conversion of goods delivered without production of the original bill of lading. The court held that the exclusion clause in the bill of lading was not competent to exclude liability for this breach, and the limitation clause was not sufficiently clear and unambiguous to limit the carrier's liability for such a fundamental breach.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCCL 27/2008 MAU WING INDUSTRIAL LIMITED v ENSIGN FREIGHT PTE LIMITED and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Fundamental Obligation**: In both cases, there is a fundamental obligation that was breached. In the precedent case, it was the obligation to deliver goods only against the production of the original bill of lading. In the current case, it is the obligation to deliver crabs of a certain size and quality.
- **Legal Concept 2: Exclusion Clause**: Both cases involve an exclusion clause where the seller/carrier attempts to exclude liability for breaches. In the precedent case, the exclusion clause was found to be ineffective for a fundamental breach. In the current case, Neptune's "Seller’s Liability" provision attempts to exclude liability for any defect in the seafood supplied.
- **Legal Concept 3: Limitation of Liability**: Both cases involve the interpretation of clauses that limit liability. In the precedent case, the limitation clause was not clear and unambiguous enough to limit liability for a fundamental breach. In the current case, the effectiveness of the "Seller’s Liability" provision in limiting liability for the delivery of baby crabs is in question.
- **Legal Concept 4: Contextual Interpretation**: In both cases, the court considers the context and the factual matrix surrounding the contract. In the precedent case, the court looked at the factual matrix to determine the contractual carrier. In the current case, the context includes the established practice and norms in the seafood trade regarding the size distribution of crabs.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCCL 27/2008 MAU WING INDUSTRIAL LIMITED v ENSIGN FREIGHT PTE LIMITED)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern involving a fundamental obligation and an exclusion or limitation clause, the court should decide that such clauses are ineffective if they are not clear and unambiguous in excluding or limiting liability for fundamental breaches. This rule was justified in HCCL 27/2008 MAU WING INDUSTRIAL LIMITED v ENSIGN FREIGHT PTE LIMITED because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that fundamental obligations are upheld and that parties cannot easily escape liability for significant breaches outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially limiting the enforceability of exclusion or limitation clauses in contracts. This approach upholds the underlying values and principles of contract law, ensuring fairness and predictability in commercial transactions.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCCL 27/2008 MAU WING INDUSTRIAL LIMITED v ENSIGN FREIGHT PTE LIMITED) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Fundamental Obligation**: In the precedent case, the fundamental obligation was to deliver goods only against the production of the original bill of lading. In the current case, the fundamental obligation is to deliver crabs of a certain size and quality, as per the established norms and practices in the seafood trade.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Exclusion Clause**: In the precedent case, the exclusion clause was found to be ineffective for a fundamental breach. In the current case, Neptune's "Seller’s Liability" provision attempts to exclude liability for any defect in the seafood supplied, which includes the delivery of baby mud crabs that do not meet the required size and quality for Wong Kee's signature dish.

- **Legal Concept 3: Limitation of Liability**: In the precedent case, the limitation clause was not clear and unambiguous enough to limit liability for a fundamental breach. In the current case, the effectiveness of the "Seller’s Liability" provision in limiting liability for the delivery of baby crabs is in question, especially since it attempts to exclude all liability for any defect, which is a broad and sweeping exclusion.

- **Legal Concept 4: Contextual Interpretation**: In the precedent case, the court considered the context and the factual matrix surrounding the contract. In the current case, the context includes the established practice and norms in the seafood trade regarding the size distribution of crabs, which both parties were aware of and followed in their dealings.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCCL 27/2008 MAU WING INDUSTRIAL LIMITED v ENSIGN FREIGHT PTE LIMITED. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Fundamental Obligations**: Ensuring that fundamental obligations are upheld is crucial for the proper functioning of commercial transactions. In this case, the fundamental obligation is to deliver crabs of a certain size and quality, which is essential for Wong Kee's business operations.

2. **Preventing Unfair Exclusion of Liability**: Allowing broad and sweeping exclusion clauses to limit liability for fundamental breaches would undermine the fairness and predictability of commercial contracts. It would enable parties to escape liability for significant breaches, which is contrary to the principles of contract law.

3. **Maintaining Commercial Standards**: The decision would reinforce the importance of adhering to established norms and practices in the seafood trade, ensuring that suppliers cannot unilaterally alter the terms of supply to the detriment of buyers.

4. **Protecting Business Interests**: By holding Neptune liable for the delivery of baby mud crabs, the court would protect Wong Kee's business interests, ensuring that it can rely on the quality and size of crabs supplied for its signature dish, which is critical for its reputation and financial success.

In conclusion, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCCL 27/2008 MAU WING INDUSTRIAL LIMITED v ENSIGN FREIGHT PTE LIMITED, it would uphold fundamental obligations, prevent unfair exclusion of liability, maintain commercial standards, and protect business interests.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the "composition" clause, that was not present in HCCL 27/2008 MAU WING INDUSTRIAL LIMITED v ENSIGN FREIGHT PTE LIMITED. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it explicitly grants Neptune "the absolute discretion to determine the size of mud crabs supplied under the Agreement." Due to this clause, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences than positive ones, unlike in HCCL 27/2008 MAU WING INDUSTRIAL LIMITED v ENSIGN FREIGHT PTE LIMITED. 

The presence of the "composition" clause means that Wong Kee had agreed to give Neptune discretion over the size of the crabs supplied. This clause conflicts with the shared fact pattern of a fundamental obligation to deliver crabs of a certain size and quality. Because of this clause, Neptune could argue that it was within its contractual rights to deliver baby mud crabs, even if this was not in line with the usual practice. Therefore, applying the same outcome as in the precedent case would undermine the contractual agreement between the parties and could lead to more negative consequences, such as undermining the enforceability of clear contractual terms and creating uncertainty in commercial agreements.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCCL 27/2008 MAU WING INDUSTRIAL LIMITED v ENSIGN FREIGHT PTE LIMITED should be stated as: "When both a fundamental obligation and an exclusion or limitation clause are present, and the exclusion or limitation clause is not clear and unambiguous in excluding or limiting liability for fundamental breaches, the court should decide that such clauses are ineffective." Omitting the "composition" clause from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of undermining the enforceability of clear contractual terms and creating uncertainty in commercial agreements. Indeed, the opinion in HCCL 27/2008 MAU WING INDUSTRIAL LIMITED v ENSIGN FREIGHT PTE LIMITED explicitly states that the exclusion and limitation clauses were not clear and unambiguous enough to limit liability for a fundamental breach, which was crucial to their decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCCL 27/2008 MAU WING INDUSTRIAL LIMITED v ENSIGN FREIGHT PTE LIMITED was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of parties escaping liability for significant breaches of fundamental obligations through unclear and ambiguous exclusion or limitation clauses. However, in our current case, the presence of the "composition" clause explicitly granting Neptune "the absolute discretion to determine the size of mud crabs supplied under the Agreement" means that there is no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring. The "composition" clause provides a clear and unambiguous term that was agreed upon by both parties, thereby preventing the risk of uncertainty and ensuring that the contractual terms are enforceable. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the explicit "composition" clause, which was present in the precedent case HCCL 27/2008 MAU WING INDUSTRIAL LIMITED v ENSIGN FREIGHT PTE LIMITED, requiring this factor for all similar cases of fundamental obligation breaches would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would allow parties to escape liability for significant breaches of fundamental obligations by inserting broad and sweeping exclusion clauses, thereby undermining the fairness and predictability of commercial contracts. Conversely, not requiring the explicit "composition" clause would allow for a more equitable outcome, ensuring that parties cannot unilaterally alter the terms of supply to the detriment of buyers. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which emphasize fairness, predictability, and the upholding of fundamental obligations.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the explicit "composition" clause, which was present in HCCL 27/2008 MAU WING INDUSTRIAL LIMITED v ENSIGN FREIGHT PTE LIMITED, we have the additional factor of established norms and practices in the seafood trade regarding the size distribution of crabs. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of a fundamental obligation to deliver crabs of a certain size and quality, serves a similar function to the "composition" clause in the precedent case. Given the presence of these established norms and practices, we submit that the reasoning in HCCL 27/2008 MAU WING INDUSTRIAL LIMITED v ENSIGN FREIGHT PTE LIMITED still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values—such as upholding fundamental obligations, preventing unfair exclusion of liability, maintaining commercial standards, and protecting business interests—would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCCL 27/2008 MAU WING INDUSTRIAL LIMITED v ENSIGN FREIGHT PTE LIMITED, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of a fundamental obligation and an exclusion clause attempting to limit liability for breaches of that obligation. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the presence of the "composition" clause in the current case, which grants Neptune "the absolute discretion to determine the size of mud crabs supplied under the Agreement."

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case—that exclusion or limitation clauses are ineffective if they are not clear and unambiguous in excluding or limiting liability for fundamental breaches—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the "composition" clause in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides. On one hand, the initial analogy emphasizes the importance of upholding fundamental obligations and preventing unfair exclusion of liability, which aligns with the principles of fairness and predictability in contract law. On the other hand, the rebuttal arguments highlight the significance of the "composition" clause, which explicitly grants Neptune discretion over the size of the crabs, thereby altering the context and expectations of the contractual agreement.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, predictability, and the upholding of fundamental obligations, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the "Seller’s Liability" provision in the current case should not be effective in excluding Neptune's liability for the delivery of baby mud crabs. This decision is reached because:

1. **Fundamental Obligation**: The fundamental obligation to deliver crabs of a certain size and quality, as per the established norms and practices in the seafood trade, remains crucial for the proper functioning of Wong Kee's business.

2. **Exclusion Clause**: The "Seller’s Liability" provision is broad and sweeping, attempting to exclude all liability for any defect in the seafood supplied. Such a clause is not sufficiently clear and unambiguous to limit liability for a fundamental breach, especially when it conflicts with established trade practices.

3. **Contextual Interpretation**: The established norms and practices in the seafood trade regarding the size distribution of crabs provide a clear context that both parties were aware of and followed in their dealings. This context supports the expectation that crabs of a certain size and quality would be delivered.

4. **Commercial Standards**: Upholding the exclusion clause in this case would undermine the established norms and practices in the seafood trade, leading to uncertainty and unfairness in commercial agreements.

5. **Business Interests**: Protecting Wong Kee's business interests and ensuring that it can rely on the quality and size of crabs supplied for its signature dish is essential for its reputation and financial success.

Therefore, we hold that Neptune is liable for the delivery of baby mud crabs, and the "Seller’s Liability" provision does not effectively exclude Neptune's liability for this breach. This decision aligns with the principles of fairness, predictability, and the upholding of fundamental obligations in contract law.

   - There is an implied condition that the goods shall be free from any defect, rendering them unmerchantable, which would not be apparent on reasonable examination of the sample

   Exceptions:
   - None

5. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 57 Subsection 1

   Conditions:
   - Any right, duty or liability would arise under a contract of sale of goods by implication of law

   Consequences:
   - It may be negatived or varied by express agreement, or by the course of dealing between the parties, or by usage if the usage is such as to bind both parties to the contract

   Exceptions:
   - Subject to the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 71)

### Minor Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 15 Subsection 1:
   - There is a contract for the sale of goods by description between Wong Kee and Neptune.
   - The description of the goods (crabs) was understood to conform to the norms and practices of the seafood trade in Hong Kong.
   - The delivery of baby mud crabs does not correspond with the description as per the norms and practices.

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 16 Subsection 2:
   - Neptune sells crabs in the course of its business.
   - There is an implied condition that the crabs supplied under the contract are of merchantable quality.
   - The baby mud crabs delivered were not of merchantable quality for Wong Kee's purpose of making "Typhoon Shelter Crab."

3. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 16 Subsection 3:
   - Neptune sells crabs in the course of its business.
   - Wong Kee, by implication, made known to Neptune that the crabs were being bought for the purpose of making "Typhoon Shelter Crab."
   - There is an implied condition that the crabs supplied are reasonably fit for that purpose.
   - The baby mud crabs were not reasonably fit for making "Typhoon Shelter Crab."

4. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 17 Subsection 2:
   - There is no indication that the contract was for sale by sample, so this section does not apply.

5. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 57 Subsection 1:
   - The implied terms regarding the quality and suitability of the goods can be negatived or varied by express agreement or by the course of dealing between the parties.
   - The "Seller’s Liability" provision in the draft contract attempts to exclude liability for any defect in the seafood supplied.
   - However, this provision is subject to the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 71), which may limit the enforceability of such exclusion clauses.

### Conclusion:

The delivery of baby mud crabs constitutes a breach of the implied terms regarding the quality and suitability of the goods supplied under the Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Sections 15 and 16. The implied conditions that the goods shall correspond with the description and be of merchantable quality, as well as reasonably fit for the particular purpose made known to the seller, have been breached. The "Seller’s Liability" provision may not be enforceable under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 71). Therefore, Wong Kee has a valid claim against Neptune for breach of contract.

   - The goods delivered (baby mud crabs) do not conform to the samples (previously delivered mix of medium to jumbo crabs).
   - The goods (baby mud crabs) are not reasonably fit for the purpose for which they were required (Wong Kee’s signature dish "Typhoon Shelter Crab").
   - The goods (baby mud crabs) are not of merchantable quality for Wong Kee’s specific use.
   - Wong Kee may maintain an action against Neptune for damages for the breach of warranty.
   - The measure of damages would be the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting from the breach of warranty, which includes financial losses and damage to reputation.
   - Wong Kee did not fail to take reasonable steps to avoid further or consequential loss upon discovering the defect, as the defect was discovered only upon delivery and the crabs were unusable for the intended purpose.

### Conclusion:

Wing Tat Haberdashery Co Ltd v Elegance Development & Industrial Co Ltd applies, and Wong Kee may maintain an action against Neptune for damages for the breach of warranty. The measure of damages would be the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting from the breach of warranty, including financial losses and damage to reputation.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA822/2004 BETWEEN MYRIAD ELECTRONICS LIMITED Plaintiff and ENITY TECHNOLOGY LIMITED Defendant)
In the case of HCA822/2004 BETWEEN MYRIAD ELECTRONICS LIMITED Plaintiff and ENITY TECHNOLOGY LIMITED Defendant (precedent p), the plaintiff claimed for the price of goods sold and delivered to the defendant. The defendant claimed set-off and counterclaims, including faulty goods and poaching clients. The court ruled that the defendant should be allowed to defend conditionally on paying into court the sum owed to the plaintiff, while also allowing for the claim for breach of a separate contract.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA822/2004 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Implied Terms of Quality and Fitness for Purpose**: In HCA822/2004, the defendant argued that the goods were faulty and did not meet the implied terms of merchantable quality and fitness for purpose under the Sale of Goods Ordinance. Similarly, in our current case, Wong Kee argues that the delivery of baby mud crabs breaches the implied terms regarding the quality and suitability of the goods supplied.
- **Breach of Contract**: In HCA822/2004, the defendant claimed that the plaintiff breached a separate contract for the supply of goods. In our current case, Wong Kee contends that Neptune breached the contract by delivering baby mud crabs instead of the usual mix of sizes.
- **Set-off and Counterclaims**: In HCA822/2004, the defendant raised set-off and counterclaims to extinguish the plaintiff’s claim. In our current case, Wong Kee may similarly argue that the financial losses and damage to reputation due to the delivery of unsuitable crabs should offset any claims Neptune might have.
- **Course of Dealing and Established Practices**: In HCA822/2004, the court considered the established practices and course of dealing between the parties. In our current case, the long-standing informal arrangement and the norms of the seafood trade are relevant to determining the expectations and obligations of the parties.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA822/2004)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern involving the delivery of goods that do not meet the implied terms of quality and fitness for purpose, and there is a breach of contract, the court should allow the aggrieved party to defend or counterclaim conditionally. This rule was justified in HCA822/2004 because the positive effects (E+) of allowing the defendant to defend conditionally on paying into court the sum owed, while considering the breach of a separate contract, outweighed the negative effects (E-) of potentially delaying the plaintiff’s recovery of the debt. This approach ensures that both parties' claims and defenses are fairly considered, promoting justice and adherence to contractual obligations.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA822/2004 BETWEEN MYRIAD ELECTRONICS LIMITED Plaintiff and ENITY TECHNOLOGY LIMITED Defendant) are present:

- **Implied Terms of Quality and Fitness for Purpose**: In HCA822/2004, the defendant argued that the goods were faulty and did not meet the implied terms of merchantable quality and fitness for purpose under the Sale of Goods Ordinance. Similarly, in our current case, Wong Kee argues that the delivery of baby mud crabs breaches the implied terms regarding the quality and suitability of the goods supplied.
- **Breach of Contract**: In HCA822/2004, the defendant claimed that the plaintiff breached a separate contract for the supply of goods. In our current case, Wong Kee contends that Neptune breached the contract by delivering baby mud crabs instead of the usual mix of sizes.
- **Set-off and Counterclaims**: In HCA822/2004, the defendant raised set-off and counterclaims to extinguish the plaintiff’s claim. In our current case, Wong Kee may similarly argue that the financial losses and damage to reputation due to the delivery of unsuitable crabs should offset any claims Neptune might have.
- **Course of Dealing and Established Practices**: In HCA822/2004, the court considered the established practices and course of dealing between the parties. In our current case, the long-standing informal arrangement and the norms of the seafood trade are relevant to determining the expectations and obligations of the parties.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach a similar outcome. Specifically, the court should allow Wong Kee to defend against any claims by Neptune conditionally, while also considering Wong Kee's counterclaims for financial losses and damage to reputation.

This decision would be justified because, as in HCA822/2004, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Fair Consideration of Both Parties' Claims**: Allowing Wong Kee to defend conditionally ensures that both parties' claims and defenses are fairly considered, promoting justice and adherence to contractual obligations.
2. **Adherence to Established Trade Practices**: Recognizing the norms and practices of the seafood trade in Hong Kong respects the established course of dealing between the parties and ensures that industry standards are upheld.
3. **Protection of Implied Terms**: Enforcing the implied terms of quality and fitness for purpose under the Sale of Goods Ordinance protects buyers from receiving substandard goods and ensures that sellers meet their obligations.
4. **Encouragement of Formal Agreements**: Highlighting the importance of formalizing agreements encourages businesses to document their arrangements clearly, reducing the likelihood of disputes and misunderstandings.

Therefore, given the shared fact patterns and the positive effects on the underlying values and principles of the law, the court should reach the same outcome as in HCA822/2004.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA822/2004 BETWEEN MYRIAD ELECTRONICS LIMITED Plaintiff and ENITY TECHNOLOGY LIMITED Defendant, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of a formal written guarantee provided by the defendant. This guarantee was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as providing a clear basis for the plaintiff's claim and ensuring that the defendant had a formal obligation to pay, outweighed any potential drawbacks, such as delaying the defendant's ability to raise set-off and counterclaims. The formal guarantee provided a clear and unequivocal acknowledgment of the debt, which justified the court's decision to conditionally allow the defendant to defend upon payment into court.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of a formal written guarantee is notably absent. The dealings between Wong Kee and Neptune were conducted on an informal basis, and although there was a draft contract, it was never signed and returned by Wong Kee. This lack of a formal written agreement means that there is no clear and unequivocal acknowledgment of the terms and obligations, which complicates the determination of liability and the enforcement of any implied terms regarding the quality and suitability of the goods supplied.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the long-standing informal arrangement and established trade practices, that was not present in HCA822/2004 BETWEEN MYRIAD ELECTRONICS LIMITED Plaintiff and ENITY TECHNOLOGY LIMITED Defendant. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the informal arrangement and established trade practices between Wong Kee and Neptune create an expectation and understanding of the quality and composition of the crabs to be supplied. Due to this long-standing informal arrangement and the norms of the seafood trade, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as undermining the established trade practices and expectations, than positive ones, unlike in HCA822/2004. The informal but consistent dealings and the adherence to trade norms create an implied understanding that the crabs supplied would meet certain quality and size standards, which was not a consideration in the precedent case. Therefore, the absence of a formal written agreement in our current case should not preclude Wong Kee from defending against Neptune's claims and raising counterclaims for the financial losses and damage to reputation due to the delivery of unsuitable crabs.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA822/2004 BETWEEN MYRIAD ELECTRONICS LIMITED Plaintiff and ENITY TECHNOLOGY LIMITED Defendant should be stated as: "When both [the delivery of goods that do not meet the implied terms of quality and fitness for purpose] and [the presence of a formal written guarantee or agreement] are present, the court should decide [to allow the aggrieved party to defend conditionally on paying into court the sum owed, while also considering the breach of a separate contract]." Omitting [the presence of a formal written guarantee or agreement] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q], such as undermining the clarity and enforceability of contractual obligations, and potentially allowing parties to evade their responsibilities based on informal or ambiguous arrangements. Indeed, the opinion in HCA822/2004 explicitly states that the formal guarantee was crucial to their decision, as it provided a clear acknowledgment of the debt and justified the conditional leave to defend.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA822/2004 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of parties evading their contractual obligations by relying on informal or ambiguous arrangements. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because the long-standing informal arrangement and established trade practices between Wong Kee and Neptune create a clear and mutual understanding of the quality and composition of the crabs to be supplied. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The informal but consistent dealings and the adherence to trade norms provide sufficient clarity and enforceability of the parties' obligations, making the absence of a formal written agreement less critical in this context.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the formal written guarantee, which was present in the precedent case HCA822/2004 BETWEEN MYRIAD ELECTRONICS LIMITED Plaintiff and ENITY TECHNOLOGY LIMITED Defendant, requiring this factor for all similar cases of implied terms regarding the quality and suitability of goods supplied would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would undermine the established trade practices and expectations that have been built over years of consistent dealings. Conversely, not requiring a formal written guarantee would allow for the recognition of long-standing informal arrangements and established trade norms, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area. These principles include the protection of implied terms of quality and fitness for purpose, and the fair consideration of both parties' claims based on their established course of dealing.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the formal written guarantee, which was present in HCA822/2004, we have the additional factor of a long-standing informal arrangement and established trade practices. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of implied terms of quality and fitness for purpose, serves a similar function to the formal written guarantee in the precedent case. Given the presence of this long-standing informal arrangement and adherence to trade norms, we submit that the reasoning in HCA822/2004 still applies. The positive effects on relevant legal values, such as the protection of implied terms, adherence to established trade practices, and fair consideration of both parties' claims, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA822/2004 BETWEEN MYRIAD ELECTRONICS LIMITED Plaintiff and ENITY TECHNOLOGY LIMITED Defendant, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the implied terms of quality and fitness for purpose, breach of contract, set-off and counterclaims, and the course of dealing and established practices. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of a formal written guarantee in the current case and the presence of a long-standing informal arrangement and established trade practices.

The proposed legal rule of allowing the aggrieved party to defend conditionally on paying into court the sum owed, while also considering the breach of a separate contract, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the informal but consistent dealings and adherence to trade norms in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of a formal written guarantee in the precedent case and the significance of the long-standing informal arrangement and established trade practices in the current case. Considering the underlying legal principles of protecting implied terms of quality and fitness for purpose, adherence to established trade practices, and fair consideration of both parties' claims, we conclude that the court should allow Wong Kee to defend against any claims by Neptune conditionally, while also considering Wong Kee's counterclaims for financial losses and damage to reputation.

This decision is justified because it ensures that both parties' claims and defenses are fairly considered, respects the established course of dealing and trade norms, and upholds the implied terms of quality and fitness for purpose under the Sale of Goods Ordinance. The absence of a formal written agreement in this context does not undermine the clarity and enforceability of the parties' obligations, given the long-standing informal arrangement and established trade practices.

Therefore, the court should reach a similar outcome as in HCA822/2004, allowing Wong Kee to defend conditionally while also considering its counterclaims, thereby promoting justice and legal consistency.


# Contract Law: Whether the course of dealings between Wong Kee and Neptune from June 2013 to June 2018 established an implied contract with specific terms

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 6 Subsection 1, Section 7 Subsection 1, and Section 8 Subsection 2

### Major Premise:

1. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 7 Subsection 1

   Conditions:
   - Under a contract for the supply of a service, the consideration for the service is not determined by the contract
   - The consideration is not left to be determined in a manner agreed by the contract
   - The consideration is not determined by the course of dealing between the parties

   Consequences:
   - There is an implied term that the party contracting with the supplier will pay a reasonable charge

   Exceptions:
   - None

2. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 6 Subsection 1

   Conditions:
   - Under a contract for the supply of a service by a supplier acting in the course of a business, the time for the service to be carried out is not fixed by the contract
   - The time is not left to be fixed in a manner agreed by the contract
   - The time is not determined by the course of dealing between the parties

   Consequences:
   - There is an implied term that the supplier will carry out the service within a reasonable time

   Exceptions:
   - None

3. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 8 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - A right, duty or liability would arise under a contract for the supply of a service by virtue of this Ordinance

   Consequences:
   - It may be negatived or varied by express agreement, or by the course of dealing between the parties, or by such usage as binds both parties to the contract

   Exceptions:
   - Subject to subsection (3) and the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 71)

### Minor Premise:

1. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 7 Subsection 1:
   - Wong Kee and Neptune had an informal arrangement for the supply of crabs.
   - The consideration (price) for the crabs was determined by the prevailing market price quoted over the phone.
   - Therefore, the consideration was determined by the course of dealing between the parties.
   - This section does not apply.

2. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 6 Subsection 1:
   - The time for the delivery of crabs was understood to be the next Monday following the order.
   - The time for the service was determined by the course of dealing between the parties.
   - This section does not apply.

3. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 8 Subsection 2:
   - The right, duty, or liability regarding the composition of the crabs would arise under the contract for the supply of a service by virtue of this Ordinance.
   - The composition of the crabs was generally in accordance with the norms and practices of the seafood trade, which is a usage binding both parties.
   - The "composition" clause in the draft contract, which reserved Neptune the absolute discretion to determine the size of mud crabs, was not formally agreed upon as the contract was not signed.
   - The course of dealing and the usage in the seafood trade would imply that the composition should conform to the norms and practices.

### Conclusion:

The course of dealings between Wong Kee and Neptune from June 2013 to June 2018 established an implied contract with specific terms, including the composition of the crabs conforming to the norms and practices of the seafood trade. Neptune's delivery of only baby mud crabs in December 2020 breached this implied term, as it did not conform to the established norms and practices. Therefore, Wong Kee may have a valid claim for breach of contract against Neptune.

## Deductive Reasoning: cfa

### Relevant law:

Shanghai Tongji Science & Technology Industrial Company Limited v Casil Clearing Limited

### Major Premise:

1. Shanghai Tongji Science & Technology Industrial Company Limited v Casil Clearing Limited

   Conditions:
   - The conduct of the parties is such that it objectively appears they have agreed in the same terms on the same subject-matter.
   - The conduct is unequivocally referable to the contract sought to be inferred.
   - The conduct is inconsistent with there being no contract made between the parties to the effect contended for.

   Consequences:
   - A legally binding contract may be inferred from the conduct of the parties.

   Exceptions:
   - The conduct is equally consistent with an intention not to contract.
   - One party knows that the other party does not intend to contract on the terms alleged.

### Minor Premise:

1. The conduct of Wong Kee and Neptune from June 2013 to June 2018 objectively appears they have agreed in the same terms on the same subject-matter:
   - Wong Kee consistently ordered crabs from Neptune on a weekly basis.
   - Neptune consistently delivered the crabs as per the orders.
   - Both parties followed the norms and practices of the seafood trade regarding the distribution of crab sizes.

2. The conduct is unequivocally referable to the contract sought to be inferred:
   - The regular and consistent ordering and delivery of crabs over a five-year period indicates a mutual understanding and agreement.
   - The draft contract sent by Wong Kee in June 2018 and the subsequent amendments by Neptune further support the existence of an agreement.

3. The conduct is inconsistent with there being no contract made between the parties to the effect contended for:
   - The continuous and uninterrupted transactions between the parties, even after the draft contract was amended and accepted (though not signed), suggest that both parties acted as if a binding agreement was in place.

### Conclusion:

A legally binding contract may be inferred from the conduct of Wong Kee and Neptune from June 2013 to June 2018, as all conditions are satisfied and no exceptions apply. Therefore, the course of dealings between Wong Kee and Neptune established an implied contract with specific terms.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA012172/1996)
In the case of HCA012172/1996 BETWEEN SAFE STEEL FURNITURE FACTORY LIMITED Plaintiff AND LAMEX TRADING COMPANY LIMITED Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the agreement between the parties was not for an indefinite term. The court found that the provisions of the agreement were only up to 1994 and were not capable of being extended beyond that period. The court also held that any implied term suggesting the agreement continued indefinitely would be void for uncertainty.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA012172/1996 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Duration of Agreement**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (p)**: The agreement did not specify a duration, leading to a dispute over whether it was for an indefinite term.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (c)**: The dealings between Wong Kee and Neptune were conducted on an informal basis without a formalized duration until the draft contract in June 2018.

- **Legal Concept 2: Implied Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (p)**: The plaintiff argued for an implied term that the agreement would continue indefinitely, which the court found void for uncertainty.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (c)**: Wong Kee and Neptune had an understanding of the delivery and pricing of crabs, but no formalized agreement until June 2018, raising the question of whether there was an implied contract with specific terms.

- **Legal Concept 3: Course of Dealings**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (p)**: The court examined the course of dealings and the express terms of the agreement to determine its duration and obligations.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (c)**: The course of dealings between Wong Kee and Neptune from June 2013 to June 2018 involved regular orders and deliveries, suggesting an implied understanding of terms.

- **Legal Concept 4: Uncertainty and Enforceability**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (p)**: The court found that any implied term for the agreement to continue indefinitely was void for uncertainty.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (c)**: The lack of a formalized agreement until June 2018 raises issues of uncertainty regarding the terms of the implied contract between Wong Kee and Neptune.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA012172/1996)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern where the duration and specific terms of an agreement are not clearly defined and are left to be implied, the court should decide that such an implied term is void for uncertainty. This rule was justified in HCA012172/1996 because the positive effects (E+) of outcome o on the underlying values and principles of the law, such as clarity, predictability, and enforceability of contracts, outweigh the negative effects (E-) in that case. The court emphasized the importance of having clear and definite terms in a contract to avoid disputes and ensure that both parties understand their obligations and rights.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA012172/1996) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Duration of Agreement**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (p)**: The agreement did not specify a duration, leading to a dispute over whether it was for an indefinite term.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (c)**: The dealings between Wong Kee and Neptune were conducted on an informal basis without a formalized duration until the draft contract in June 2018.

- **Legal Concept 2: Implied Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (p)**: The plaintiff argued for an implied term that the agreement would continue indefinitely, which the court found void for uncertainty.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (c)**: Wong Kee and Neptune had an understanding of the delivery and pricing of crabs, but no formalized agreement until June 2018, raising the question of whether there was an implied contract with specific terms.

- **Legal Concept 3: Course of Dealings**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (p)**: The court examined the course of dealings and the express terms of the agreement to determine its duration and obligations.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (c)**: The course of dealings between Wong Kee and Neptune from June 2013 to June 2018 involved regular orders and deliveries, suggesting an implied understanding of terms.

- **Legal Concept 4: Uncertainty and Enforceability**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (p)**: The court found that any implied term for the agreement to continue indefinitely was void for uncertainty.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (c)**: The lack of a formalized agreement until June 2018 raises issues of uncertainty regarding the terms of the implied contract between Wong Kee and Neptune.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCA012172/1996. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Clarity and Predictability**: Enforcing a rule that requires clear and definite terms in a contract ensures that both parties understand their obligations and rights, reducing the likelihood of disputes.
2. **Enforceability**: Contracts with uncertain terms are difficult to enforce, leading to potential injustices and inefficiencies. By requiring clear terms, the court promotes the enforceability of agreements.
3. **Commercial Certainty**: Businesses can operate with greater confidence when they know that their agreements will be upheld only if they are clear and specific. This encourages better business practices and more reliable commercial relationships.
4. **Fairness**: Both parties are protected from the risks associated with vague and indefinite agreements. This ensures that neither party can be unfairly bound by terms that were not clearly agreed upon.

Therefore, applying the rule from HCA012172/1996 to the current case would uphold these underlying values and principles of contract law, ensuring that agreements are clear, predictable, and enforceable.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the "Seller’s Liability" provision, that was not present in HCA012172/1996. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of "Uncertainty and Enforceability" because it explicitly limits Neptune's liability for any defects in the seafood supplied. Due to this "Seller’s Liability" provision, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as unfairly limiting Wong Kee's ability to claim damages for the defective baby crabs, unlike in HCA012172/1996 where no such liability limitation existed. This provision shifts the balance of obligations and protections between the parties, making the implied terms and course of dealings more critical to determining the enforceability and fairness of the agreement.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA012172/1996 should be stated as "When both the fact pattern of an agreement lacking a specified duration and the presence of a 'Seller’s Liability' provision are present, the court should decide that the implied terms are void for uncertainty." Omitting the 'Seller’s Liability' provision from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of unfairly limiting the buyer's ability to claim damages for defective goods, thereby creating an imbalance in the contractual obligations and protections between the parties. Indeed, the opinion in HCA012172/1996 explicitly states that the absence of clear terms and the resulting uncertainty were crucial to their decision. Including the 'Seller’s Liability' provision in the rule ensures that the court considers the full context of the agreement, including any clauses that might unfairly limit one party's rights.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA012172/1996 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of enforcing contracts with indefinite and uncertain terms, which could lead to disputes and unenforceability. However, in our current case, the presence of the 'Seller’s Liability' provision introduces a new dimension that was not present in the precedent case. This provision explicitly limits Neptune's liability for any defects in the seafood supplied, which shifts the balance of obligations and protections between the parties. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule without considering this provision would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—to ensure clarity and enforceability—would not be fully relevant to our situation. The 'Seller’s Liability' provision necessitates a more nuanced approach to determine the fairness and enforceability of the implied terms in the agreement between Wong Kee and Neptune.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the explicit "Seller’s Liability" provision, which was present in the precedent case HCA012172/1996, requiring this factor for all similar cases of implied terms and course of dealings would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would create a loophole where parties could avoid liability for defective goods simply by not including such a provision in their agreements. Conversely, not requiring the "Seller’s Liability" provision would allow for a more balanced and fair assessment of the implied terms and course of dealings, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, such as fairness, predictability, and enforceability. This approach ensures that both parties are held to reasonable standards of performance and liability, even in the absence of an explicit liability clause.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the explicit "Seller’s Liability" provision, which was present in HCA012172/1996, we have the additional factor of a long-standing course of dealings between Wong Kee and Neptune from June 2013 to June 2018. This course of dealings, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of informal agreements and implied terms, serves a similar function to the "Seller’s Liability" provision in the precedent case. Given the presence of this long-standing course of dealings, we submit that the reasoning in HCA012172/1996 still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values—such as clarity, predictability, and enforceability—would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. This ensures that the implied terms are assessed fairly and that both parties are held to reasonable standards of performance and liability.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA012172/1996, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the lack of a specified duration in the agreement and the reliance on implied terms and course of dealings to establish the contractual relationship. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the presence of a long-standing course of dealings between Wong Kee and Neptune from June 2013 to June 2018, and the absence of an explicit "Seller’s Liability" provision.

The proposed legal rule from HCA012172/1996, which states that implied terms suggesting an agreement continues indefinitely are void for uncertainty, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the long-standing course of dealings between Wong Kee and Neptune, which suggests a more nuanced understanding of the parties' relationship and expectations.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point from the precedent case that contracts with indefinite and uncertain terms are difficult to enforce and lead to disputes, and the counterargument that the long-standing course of dealings between Wong Kee and Neptune provides a basis for implying certain terms with reasonable certainty.

Considering the underlying legal principles of clarity, predictability, enforceability, and fairness, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the course of dealings between Wong Kee and Neptune from June 2013 to June 2018 did establish an implied contract with specific terms. This conclusion is supported by the consistent and regular transactions between the parties, the mutual understanding of delivery and pricing, and the absence of significant disputes over the terms during this period.

Therefore, the implied terms of the contract should include the regular delivery schedule, the prevailing market price, and the distribution of crab sizes according to industry norms. However, the "Seller’s Liability" provision proposed in the draft contract should not be considered part of the implied terms, as it was not explicitly agreed upon and would unfairly limit Wong Kee's ability to claim damages for defective goods.

In conclusion, the decision reached aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by recognizing the established course of dealings and the reasonable expectations of both parties.

   Exceptions:
   - Only in so far as the term satisfies the requirement of reasonableness

### Minor Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 16 Subsection 3:
   - Neptune sells crabs in the course of a business.
   - Wong Kee, by implication, makes known to Neptune the particular purpose for which the crabs are being bought (for their signature dish "Typhoon Shelter Crab").
   - There is an implied condition that the crabs supplied under the contract are reasonably fit for that purpose.
   - The circumstances do not show that Wong Kee does not rely, or that it is unreasonable for Wong Kee to rely, on Neptune's skill or judgment.

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 16 Subsection 2(b):
   - Neptune sells crabs in the course of a business.
   - There is no indication that Wong Kee examines the crabs before the contract is made.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

3. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 16 Subsection 2(c):
   - Neptune sells crabs in the course of a business.
   - The contract is not a contract for sale by sample.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

### Conclusion:

The "composition" clause granting Neptune "absolute discretion" to determine the size of crabs supplied is not reasonable and enforceable. The implied condition that the crabs supplied are reasonably fit for the particular purpose (i.e., for Wong Kee's signature dish) cannot be excluded or restricted by the "Seller’s Liability" provision, as it does not satisfy the requirement of reasonableness. Therefore, Wong Kee can claim that Neptune breached the implied condition of fitness for purpose.

### Major Premise:

1. CACV 12/2015 Tadjudin Sunny v Bank of America, National Association

   Conditions:
   - A power or discretion is given to a party to a contract which on its face is unqualified
   - The exercise of that power or discretion is not in good faith, rationally, or for a proper purpose
   - The exercise of that power or discretion is arbitrary, capricious, or in a manner which is not bona fide

   Consequences:

   Exceptions:
   - The exercise of the power or discretion is in good faith, rationally, and for a proper purpose

### Minor Premise:

1. CACV 12/2015 Tadjudin Sunny v Bank of America, National Association:
   - Neptune has been given the power or discretion to determine the size of mud crabs supplied under the Agreement, which on its face is unqualified.
   - Neptune exercised this discretion by supplying only baby mud crabs, which was not in good faith, rationally, or for a proper purpose, as it knew Wong Kee required crabs suitable for its signature dish.
   - The exercise of this discretion was arbitrary and capricious, as it deviated significantly from the established norms and practices of the seafood trade and was not bona fide, given the prior consistent supply of mixed sizes and the significant impact on Wong Kee's business.

### Conclusion:

The 'composition' clause granting Neptune 'absolute discretion' to determine the size of crabs supplied is not reasonable and enforceable because Neptune's exercise of this discretion was not in good faith, rationally, or for a proper purpose, and was arbitrary and capricious. Therefore, the power or discretion is subject to implied restrictions and may be deemed unenforceable.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (FALCON INSURANCE CO (HONG KONG) LTD v. ISP HOLDINGS LTD)
In the case of FALCON INSURANCE CO (HONG KONG) LTD v. ISP HOLDINGS LTD (precedent p), the court dealt with the issue of whether the plaintiff's discretionary powers under the Indemnity Agreements were subject to an implied term of rationality. The court ruled that the plaintiff's discretion to demand additional security deposits must be exercised rationally, even though the contract used the term "absolute discretion." The court found that the plaintiff had not exercised its discretion rationally in demanding the cash deposit, and thus, summary judgment was inappropriate.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in FALCON INSURANCE CO (HONG KONG) LTD v. ISP HOLDINGS LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Discretionary Powers in Contracts**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (p)**: The plaintiff had discretionary powers to demand additional security under the Indemnity Agreements.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (c)**: Neptune has discretionary powers to determine the size of mud crabs supplied under the Agreement.

- **Legal Concept 2: Implied Term of Rationality**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (p)**: The court implied a term that the plaintiff's discretion must be exercised rationally.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (c)**: The question arises whether Neptune's discretion to determine the size of crabs must also be exercised rationally.

- **Legal Concept 3: Impact on Business Operations**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (p)**: The plaintiff's demand for a cash deposit had significant financial implications for the defendant.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (c)**: Neptune's supply of only baby mud crabs had significant financial implications for Wong Kee, affecting its ability to serve its signature dish.

- **Legal Concept 4: Reasonableness and Enforceability of Contractual Clauses**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (p)**: The court examined whether the exercise of discretion was reasonable and enforceable.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (c)**: The court needs to examine whether Neptune's exercise of discretion in supplying only baby crabs was reasonable and enforceable.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (FALCON INSURANCE CO (HONG KONG) LTD v. ISP HOLDINGS LTD)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a contractual clause granting one party discretionary powers, the court should decide that such discretion must be exercised rationally. This rule was justified in FALCON INSURANCE CO (HONG KONG) LTD v. ISP HOLDINGS LTD because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring fairness and preventing abuse of discretion in contractual relationships outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially limiting the freedom of contract.

In the current case, applying this rule would mean that Neptune's "absolute discretion" to determine the size of crabs supplied must be exercised rationally. Given the significant impact on Wong Kee's business operations and the established norms in the seafood trade, it is arguable that supplying only baby crabs was not a rational exercise of discretion. Therefore, the court should find that Neptune's discretion must be exercised in a manner that is reasonable and consistent with the expectations and practices of the industry.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (FALCON INSURANCE CO (HONG KONG) LTD v. ISP HOLDINGS LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Discretionary Powers in Contracts**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (p)**: The plaintiff had discretionary powers to demand additional security under the Indemnity Agreements.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (c)**: Neptune has discretionary powers to determine the size of mud crabs supplied under the Agreement.

- **Legal Concept 2: Implied Term of Rationality**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (p)**: The court implied a term that the plaintiff's discretion must be exercised rationally.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (c)**: The question arises whether Neptune's discretion to determine the size of crabs must also be exercised rationally.

- **Legal Concept 3: Impact on Business Operations**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (p)**: The plaintiff's demand for a cash deposit had significant financial implications for the defendant.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (c)**: Neptune's supply of only baby mud crabs had significant financial implications for Wong Kee, affecting its ability to serve its signature dish.

- **Legal Concept 4: Reasonableness and Enforceability of Contractual Clauses**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (p)**: The court examined whether the exercise of discretion was reasonable and enforceable.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (c)**: The court needs to examine whether Neptune's exercise of discretion in supplying only baby crabs was reasonable and enforceable.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in FALCON INSURANCE CO (HONG KONG) LTD v. ISP HOLDINGS LTD. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Fairness**: Imposing an implied term of rationality ensures that Neptune cannot arbitrarily or capriciously exercise its discretion to the detriment of Wong Kee. This aligns with the principle of fairness in contractual relationships, especially where one party has significant discretionary power.

2. **Preventing Abuse of Discretion**: By requiring Neptune to exercise its discretion rationally, the court would prevent potential abuse of power. This is particularly important in commercial contracts where one party's actions can have significant financial implications for the other.

3. **Consistency with Industry Norms**: The seafood trade in Hong Kong has established norms and practices regarding the distribution of crab sizes. Requiring Neptune to adhere to these norms ensures predictability and stability in the market, which benefits all parties involved.

4. **Business Efficacy**: Imposing a rationality requirement ensures that the contract works effectively for both parties. Wong Kee relies on a predictable supply of crabs to maintain its business operations. Arbitrary decisions by Neptune undermine this predictability and can cause significant business disruptions.

Therefore, the court should find that Neptune's "absolute discretion" to determine the size of crabs supplied must be exercised rationally. Given the significant impact on Wong Kee's business operations and the established norms in the seafood trade, it is arguable that supplying only baby crabs was not a rational exercise of discretion. This decision would be justified because it would ensure fairness, prevent abuse of discretion, maintain consistency with industry norms, and uphold the business efficacy of the contract.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **FALCON INSURANCE CO (HONG KONG) LTD v. ISP HOLDINGS LTD**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of **explicit financial disclosures and assurances** made by the 1st Defendant. These disclosures and assurances were key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling (ensuring rational exercise of discretion) outweighed any potential drawbacks because they provided a clear basis for assessing the financial impact and rationality of the plaintiff's demand for additional security. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of **explicit financial disclosures and assurances** is notably absent. Neptune did not provide any specific financial disclosures or assurances regarding the supply of crabs, which makes it more challenging to assess whether their discretion was exercised rationally.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor **(established industry norms and practices regarding crab sizes)** that was not present in **FALCON INSURANCE CO (HONG KONG) LTD v. ISP HOLDINGS LTD**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the seafood trade in Hong Kong has well-established norms and practices regarding the distribution of crab sizes, which are regarded as binding by all crab restaurants and suppliers. Due to these established norms, applying the same outcome (implying a term of rationality) in our case would have more positive consequences such as **ensuring consistency with industry standards and maintaining business efficacy** than negative ones, unlike in **FALCON INSURANCE CO (HONG KONG) LTD v. ISP HOLDINGS LTD**. The presence of these industry norms provides a clear benchmark for assessing the rationality of Neptune's discretion, thereby justifying the need for an implied term of rationality in the current case.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from **FALCON INSURANCE CO (HONG KONG) LTD v. ISP HOLDINGS LTD** should be stated as: "When both [discretionary powers in contracts] and [explicit financial disclosures and assurances] are present, the court should decide [that the discretion must be exercised rationally]." Omitting [explicit financial disclosures and assurances] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q], which is the potential for arbitrary or capricious exercise of discretion without a clear benchmark for rationality. Indeed, the opinion in **FALCON INSURANCE CO (HONG KONG) LTD v. ISP HOLDINGS LTD** explicitly states that the financial disclosures and assurances were crucial to their decision, as they provided a clear basis for assessing the rationality of the plaintiff's demand for additional security.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in **FALCON INSURANCE CO (HONG KONG) LTD v. ISP HOLDINGS LTD** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of arbitrary or capricious exercise of discretion without a clear benchmark for rationality]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [arbitrary or capricious exercise of discretion without a clear benchmark for rationality] occurring because the seafood trade in Hong Kong has well-established norms and practices regarding the distribution of crab sizes. These industry norms provide a clear benchmark for assessing the rationality of Neptune's discretion. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should find that Neptune's "absolute discretion" to determine the size of crabs supplied must be exercised rationally, given the significant impact on Wong Kee's business operations and the established norms in the seafood trade.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the explicit financial disclosures and assurances, which were present in the precedent case **FALCON INSURANCE CO (HONG KONG) LTD v. ISP HOLDINGS LTD**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of discretionary powers in contracts would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would allow parties with discretionary powers to act arbitrarily or capriciously in the absence of explicit financial disclosures, thereby undermining the principle of fairness in contractual relationships. Conversely, not requiring explicit financial disclosures and assurances would allow for a more flexible and equitable application of the implied term of rationality, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area. This approach ensures that discretionary powers are exercised fairly and reasonably, preventing potential abuse and maintaining the integrity of contractual relationships.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the explicit financial disclosures and assurances, which were present in **FALCON INSURANCE CO (HONG KONG) LTD v. ISP HOLDINGS LTD**, we have the additional factor of established industry norms and practices regarding crab sizes. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of discretionary powers in contracts, serves a similar function to the explicit financial disclosures in the precedent case. Given the presence of established industry norms, we submit that the reasoning in **FALCON INSURANCE CO (HONG KONG) LTD v. ISP HOLDINGS LTD** still applies, as the positive effects on ensuring fairness, preventing abuse of discretion, and maintaining consistency with industry standards would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **FALCON INSURANCE CO (HONG KONG) LTD v. ISP HOLDINGS LTD**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in the context of discretionary powers in contracts and the potential for an implied term of rationality. However, it also differs in significant ways, notably the absence of explicit financial disclosures and assurances in the current case and the presence of established industry norms and practices regarding crab sizes.

The proposed legal rule that discretionary powers in contracts must be exercised rationally finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of ensuring fairness and preventing abuse of discretion (as argued in favor of implying a term of rationality) and the potential for arbitrary or capricious exercise of discretion without a clear benchmark for rationality (as argued against implying such a term without explicit financial disclosures).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, prevention of abuse of discretion, and consistency with industry norms, we conclude that Neptune's "absolute discretion" to determine the size of crabs supplied must be exercised rationally. The established industry norms and practices regarding crab sizes provide a clear benchmark for assessing the rationality of Neptune's discretion, similar to the role played by explicit financial disclosures in the precedent case.

Therefore, the court should find that Neptune's exercise of discretion in supplying only baby crabs was not a rational exercise of discretion, given the significant impact on Wong Kee's business operations and the established norms in the seafood trade. This decision ensures fairness, prevents abuse of discretion, maintains consistency with industry standards, and upholds the business efficacy of the contract.

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 32 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - The seller delivers to the buyer a quantity of goods larger than he contracted to sell
   - The buyer accepts the whole of the goods so delivered

   - The buyer must pay for them at the contract rate

   Exceptions:
   - The provisions of this section are subject to any usage of trade, special agreement, or course of dealing between the parties

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 32 Subsection 3

   Conditions:
   - The seller delivers to the buyer the goods he contracted to sell mixed with goods of a different description not included in the contract
   - The buyer accepts the goods which are in accordance with the contract

   Consequences:
   - The buyer may reject the rest, or he may reject the whole

   Exceptions:
   - The provisions of this section are subject to any usage of trade, special agreement, or course of dealing between the parties

3. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 37 Subsections 4, 5, and 6

   Conditions:
   - The buyer is deemed to have accepted the goods
   - The buyer retains the goods without intimating to the seller that he has rejected them after the lapse of a reasonable time

   Consequences:
   - The buyer is deemed to have accepted the goods

   Exceptions:
   - The buyer has had a reasonable opportunity of examining the goods for the purpose of ascertaining whether they are in conformity with the contract
   - The buyer is not by virtue of this section deemed to have accepted the goods merely because the goods are delivered to another under a sub-sale or other disposition

4. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 13 Subsection 3

   Conditions:
   - The buyer has accepted the goods or part thereof
   - The contract of sale is not severable
   - There is a breach of any condition to be fulfilled by the seller

   Consequences:
   - The breach of any condition to be fulfilled by the seller can only be treated as a breach of warranty, and not as a ground for rejecting the goods and treating the contract as repudiated

   Exceptions:
   - There is a term of the contract, express or implied, to that effect

### Minor Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 32 Subsection 2:
   - Neptune did not deliver a quantity of goods larger than contracted; hence, this section does not apply.

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 32 Subsection 3:
   - Neptune delivered goods (baby mud crabs) not included in the contract.
   - Wong Kee did not accept the baby mud crabs.
   - Therefore, Wong Kee may reject the baby mud crabs or reject the whole delivery.
   - The provisions are subject to any usage of trade, special agreement, or course of dealing between the parties. The previous acceptance of smaller crabs on one occasion does not establish a course of dealing that would bind Wong Kee to accept baby crabs.

3. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 37 Subsections 4, 5, and 6:
   - Wong Kee did not retain the baby crabs without intimating rejection; hence, this section does not apply.

4. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 13 Subsection 3:
   - Wong Kee did not accept the baby crabs.
   - The contract of sale is not severable.
   - There is a breach of the condition regarding the size of crabs.
   - There is no term in the contract, express or implied, that would treat the breach as a breach of warranty only.

### Conclusion:

Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 32 Subsection 3 applies, and Wong Kee may reject the baby mud crabs or reject the whole delivery. The previous acceptance of smaller crabs on one occasion does not affect Wong Kee's ability to claim breach of contract for the delivery of baby crabs in December 2020.

## Deductive Reasoning: ca

### Relevant law:

Samsung Hong Kong Limited v Keen Time Trading Limited

### Major Premise:

1. Samsung Hong Kong Limited v Keen Time Trading Limited

   Conditions:
   - The plaintiff tenders a performance that does not correspond with the terms of the contract.
   - The defendant is entitled to reject such performance under the contract.
   - There is no evidence to rebut the presumption that the defendant would act reasonably and in protection of its own interest.

   Consequences:
   - The defendant is presumed to reject the non-conforming goods.
   - The plaintiff is entitled to only nominal damages.

   Exceptions:
   - There is clear and unequivocal evidence showing that the defendant would not have exercised this right of rejection.

### Minor Premise:

1. The plaintiff (Neptune) tendered a performance (delivery of baby mud crabs) that does not correspond with the terms of the contract (the usual mix of sizes, ranging from medium to jumbo).
2. The defendant (Wong Kee) is entitled to reject such performance under the contract, as the delivery of baby mud crabs does not conform to the norms and practices of the seafood trade, which are binding.
3. There is no evidence to rebut the presumption that Wong Kee would act reasonably and in protection of its own interest, as Wong Kee's business relies on the quality and size of the crabs for its signature dish.

### Conclusion:

The conditions of the major premise are satisfied. Therefore, Wong Kee is presumed to reject the non-conforming goods (baby mud crabs), and Neptune is entitled to only nominal damages. Wong Kee's acceptance of smaller crabs on one previous occasion does not affect its ability to claim breach of contract for the delivery of baby crabs in December 2020, as there is no clear and unequivocal evidence showing that Wong Kee would not have exercised this right of rejection.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA011705A/1996 BETWEEN PRECIEUX GARMENT FACTORY LIMITED Plaintiff AND THE RALPH LAUREN WOMENSWEAR CO. L.P. Defendant)
In the case of HCA011705A/1996 BETWEEN PRECIEUX GARMENT FACTORY LIMITED Plaintiff AND THE RALPH LAUREN WOMENSWEAR CO. L.P. Defendant (precedent p), the Plaintiff, a garment manufacturer, delivered blouses to the Defendant, who did not pay for them, claiming the blouses were not made in Hong Kong as required. The court ruled that the Defendant had waived its right to reject the goods by accepting them and not informing the Plaintiff of any rejection. The court also found that the blouses were indeed made in Hong Kong based on the Plaintiff's internal documents. The Plaintiff was awarded the price of the blouses plus interest, but the claim for damages due to defamation was withdrawn.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA011705A/1996 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Waiver of Rights**: In HCA011705A/1996, the Defendant waived its right to reject the blouses by accepting them and not informing the Plaintiff of any rejection. Similarly, in our current case, Wong Kee accepted smaller crabs on one previous occasion without complaint.
- **Acceptance of Goods**: In HCA011705A/1996, the Defendant accepted the blouses despite suspecting they were not made in Hong Kong. In our current case, Wong Kee accepted the smaller crabs without complaint on one occasion.
- **Breach of Contract**: In HCA011705A/1996, the issue was whether the blouses were made in Hong Kong as per the contract. In our current case, the issue is whether the delivery of baby crabs constitutes a breach of the informal agreement regarding the size distribution of crabs.
- **Evidence of Compliance**: In HCA011705A/1996, the Plaintiff provided internal documents to prove compliance with the contract. In our current case, the consistent delivery of crabs conforming to the norms and practices of the seafood trade serves as evidence of compliance.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA011705A/1996)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern where a party accepts goods without complaint despite a potential breach of contract, the court should decide that the party has waived its right to claim a breach of contract. This rule was justified in HCA011705A/1996 because the positive effects (E+) of outcome o on the underlying values and principles of the law, such as promoting certainty and fairness in commercial transactions, outweigh the negative effects (E-) in that case. Specifically, it prevents parties from accepting goods and later claiming a breach, which would create uncertainty and potential unfairness in commercial dealings.

In our current case, applying this rule would mean that Wong Kee's acceptance of smaller crabs on one previous occasion without complaint affects its ability to claim breach of contract for the delivery of baby crabs in December 2020. This promotes the principle that parties should raise issues promptly and not remain silent, only to later claim a breach when it suits them.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA011705A/1996 BETWEEN PRECIEUX GARMENT FACTORY LIMITED Plaintiff AND THE RALPH LAUREN WOMENSWEAR CO. L.P. Defendant) are present:

- **Waiver of Rights**: In HCA011705A/1996, the Defendant waived its right to reject the blouses by accepting them and not informing the Plaintiff of any rejection. Similarly, in our current case, Wong Kee accepted smaller crabs on one previous occasion without complaint.
- **Acceptance of Goods**: In HCA011705A/1996, the Defendant accepted the blouses despite suspecting they were not made in Hong Kong. In our current case, Wong Kee accepted the smaller crabs without complaint on one occasion.
- **Breach of Contract**: In HCA011705A/1996, the issue was whether the blouses were made in Hong Kong as per the contract. In our current case, the issue is whether the delivery of baby crabs constitutes a breach of the informal agreement regarding the size distribution of crabs.
- **Evidence of Compliance**: In HCA011705A/1996, the Plaintiff provided internal documents to prove compliance with the contract. In our current case, the consistent delivery of crabs conforming to the norms and practices of the seafood trade serves as evidence of compliance.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA011705A/1996, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Promoting Certainty in Commercial Transactions**: By holding that Wong Kee's acceptance of smaller crabs on one previous occasion without complaint affects its ability to claim breach of contract for the delivery of baby crabs in December 2020, the court would promote certainty in commercial transactions. Parties would be encouraged to raise issues promptly, thereby avoiding uncertainty and potential unfairness in commercial dealings.

2. **Encouraging Prompt Communication**: This outcome would encourage parties to communicate any issues or breaches promptly. In the precedent case, the Defendant's failure to promptly reject the blouses led to a waiver of its rights. Similarly, Wong Kee's failure to complain about the smaller crabs on the previous occasion should be seen as a waiver of its right to claim a breach for the delivery of baby crabs.

3. **Fairness and Consistency**: Applying the same rule ensures fairness and consistency in the application of the law. It prevents parties from accepting goods and later claiming a breach when it suits them, which would create uncertainty and potential unfairness in commercial dealings.

4. **Reliance on Established Practices**: The decision would reinforce the importance of established practices and norms in the industry. In both cases, the parties had an understanding of the norms and practices governing their transactions. By upholding these practices, the court would ensure that parties can rely on them in their commercial dealings.

Given these positive effects, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCA011705A/1996. This decision would be justified because it promotes certainty, encourages prompt communication, ensures fairness and consistency, and reinforces reliance on established practices in commercial transactions.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA011705A/1996 BETWEEN PRECIEUX GARMENT FACTORY LIMITED Plaintiff AND THE RALPH LAUREN WOMENSWEAR CO. L.P. Defendant, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of clear internal documentation and records provided by the Plaintiff. These documents were key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—promoting certainty and fairness in commercial transactions—outweighed any potential drawbacks because they provided concrete evidence that the blouses were made in Hong Kong, thereby justifying the Plaintiff's claim and the court's decision.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of clear internal documentation and records is notably absent. Wong Kee does not have similar internal records or documentation to prove that the size distribution of crabs delivered by Neptune consistently conformed to the norms and practices of the seafood trade. The absence of such documentation makes it difficult to establish a clear pattern of compliance or non-compliance with the informal agreement regarding the size distribution of crabs.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—the presence of an informal but consistent practice of ordering and delivering crabs based on established norms and practices in the seafood trade—that was not present in HCA011705A/1996 BETWEEN PRECIEUX GARMENT FACTORY LIMITED Plaintiff AND THE RALPH LAUREN WOMENSWEAR CO. L.P. Defendant. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the informal agreement and established norms in the seafood trade create an expectation of consistency in the size distribution of crabs.

Due to this established practice, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the reliability of informal but consistent commercial practices and creating uncertainty in the seafood trade. Unlike in HCA011705A/1996, where clear documentation provided a basis for the court's decision, the reliance on informal practices in our current case means that Wong Kee's acceptance of smaller crabs on one previous occasion should not necessarily be seen as a waiver of its right to claim a breach for the delivery of baby crabs. The negative consequences of undermining established trade practices and creating uncertainty outweigh the benefits of promoting prompt communication and fairness in this context.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA011705A/1996 BETWEEN PRECIEUX GARMENT FACTORY LIMITED Plaintiff AND THE RALPH LAUREN WOMENSWEAR CO. L.P. Defendant should be stated as "When both the acceptance of goods without complaint and the presence of clear internal documentation proving compliance with the contract are present, the court should decide that the party has waived its right to claim a breach of contract." Omitting the presence of clear internal documentation from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of undermining the reliability of informal but consistent commercial practices and creating uncertainty in trade. Indeed, the opinion in HCA011705A/1996 explicitly states that the internal documents provided by the Plaintiff were crucial to their decision, as they provided concrete evidence that the blouses were made in Hong Kong, thereby justifying the Plaintiff's claim and the court's decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA011705A/1996 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of parties accepting goods and later claiming a breach when it suits them, thereby creating uncertainty and potential unfairness in commercial dealings. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence occurring because the informal but consistent practice of ordering and delivering crabs based on established norms and practices in the seafood trade creates an expectation of consistency in the size distribution of crabs. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The absence of clear internal documentation in our case means that Wong Kee's acceptance of smaller crabs on one previous occasion should not necessarily be seen as a waiver of its right to claim a breach for the delivery of baby crabs, as this would undermine established trade practices and create uncertainty.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the clear internal documentation and records (factor m) that were present in the precedent case HCA011705A/1996 BETWEEN PRECIEUX GARMENT FACTORY LIMITED Plaintiff AND THE RALPH LAUREN WOMENSWEAR CO. L.P. Defendant, requiring this factor for all similar cases of waiver of rights and acceptance of goods would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would undermine the reliability of informal but consistent commercial practices and create uncertainty in trade. Conversely, not requiring clear internal documentation would allow for the recognition and enforcement of established norms and practices in the seafood trade, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, such as promoting fairness, consistency, and predictability in commercial transactions.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the clear internal documentation and records (factor m) that were present in HCA011705A/1996, we have the additional factor of an established informal practice and norms in the seafood trade (factor n). This established practice, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of acceptance of goods without complaint (i*), serves a similar function to the internal documentation in the precedent case. Given the presence of this established practice, we submit that the reasoning in HCA011705A/1996 still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as promoting certainty, fairness, and consistency in commercial transactions, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA011705A/1996 BETWEEN PRECIEUX GARMENT FACTORY LIMITED Plaintiff AND THE RALPH LAUREN WOMENSWEAR CO. L.P. Defendant, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations.

**Key Similarities:**
1. **Waiver of Rights:** Both cases involve a party accepting goods without immediate complaint, which could be interpreted as a waiver of the right to claim a breach of contract.
2. **Acceptance of Goods:** In both cases, the goods were accepted despite potential non-compliance with the terms of the agreement.
3. **Breach of Contract:** Both cases hinge on whether the delivered goods met the contractual requirements.

**Key Differences:**
1. **Internal Documentation:** In HCA011705A/1996, the Plaintiff provided clear internal documentation proving compliance with the contract, which was crucial to the court's decision. In the current case, such documentation is absent.
2. **Established Informal Practices:** The current case involves an established informal practice and norms in the seafood trade, which were not present in the precedent case.

**Proposed Legal Rule:**
The rule from HCA011705A/1996 suggests that when a party accepts goods without complaint and there is clear internal documentation proving compliance with the contract, the party has waived its right to claim a breach of contract.

**Weighing Arguments:**
- **For Applying the Rule:** The initial argument suggests that Wong Kee's acceptance of smaller crabs on one previous occasion without complaint should be seen as a waiver of its right to claim a breach for the delivery of baby crabs. This promotes certainty and fairness in commercial transactions.
- **Against Applying the Rule:** The rebuttal argues that the absence of clear internal documentation in the current case and the reliance on established informal practices in the seafood trade create a different context. Applying the same rule would undermine the reliability of these practices and create uncertainty in the trade.

**Decision:**
Considering the underlying legal principles of promoting certainty, fairness, and consistency in commercial transactions, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the rule from HCA011705A/1996 should not be applied rigidly to the current case. The absence of clear internal documentation and the presence of established informal practices in the seafood trade significantly alter the context.

**Final Decision:**
Wong Kee's acceptance of smaller crabs on one previous occasion without complaint should not be seen as a waiver of its right to claim a breach of contract for the delivery of baby crabs in December 2020. The established informal practices and norms in the seafood trade create an expectation of consistency in the size distribution of crabs, and undermining these practices would create uncertainty and potential unfairness in commercial dealings.

This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by recognizing the importance of established trade practices and the need for clear documentation in proving compliance with contractual terms.


# Contract Law: Whether the exclusion clause in the 'Seller’s Liability' provision is valid under the Unfair Contract Terms Ordinance (Cap. 71) in Hong Kong

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 7 Subsection 1, 2, and 3; Section 11 Subsection 2; Section 12 Subsection 2

### Major Premise:

1. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 7 Subsection 1 and 2

   Conditions:
   - A person seeks to exclude or restrict liability for negligence.
   - The exclusion or restriction is by reference to any contract term or notice given to persons generally or to particular persons.

   Consequences:
   - The person cannot exclude or restrict liability for death or personal injury resulting from negligence.
   - In the case of other loss or damage, the person cannot exclude or restrict liability for negligence except in so far as the term or notice satisfies the requirement of reasonableness.

   Exceptions:
   - None

2. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 7 Subsection 3

   Conditions:
   - A contract term or notice purports to exclude or restrict liability for negligence.
   - A person’s agreement to or awareness of it is considered.

   Consequences:
   - The person’s agreement to or awareness of it is not of itself to be taken as indicating his voluntary acceptance of any risk.

   Exceptions:
   - None

3. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 11 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - A person deals as consumer.
   - The other party to the contract seeks to exclude or restrict liability for breach of the obligations arising from section 15, 16, or 17 of the Sale of Goods Ordinance (Cap. 26) (seller’s implied undertakings as to conformity of goods with description or sample, or as to their quality or fitness for a particular purpose).

   Consequences:
   - The other party cannot exclude or restrict liability by reference to any contract term.

   Exceptions:
   - None

4. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 12 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - A person deals as consumer.
   - The other party to the contract seeks to exclude or restrict liability in respect of the goods’ correspondence with description or sample, or their quality or fitness for any particular purpose.

   Consequences:
   - The other party cannot exclude or restrict liability by reference to any contract term.

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 7 Subsection 1 and 2:
- Neptune seeks to exclude liability for any loss or damage arising from any defect in any seafood product supplied, however caused.
- The exclusion is by reference to a contract term in the "Seller’s Liability" provision.
- The loss or damage in question is financial loss due to the supply of baby mud crabs instead of the usual mix.
- The exclusion clause must satisfy the requirement of reasonableness to be valid.

2. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 7 Subsection 3:
- The "Seller’s Liability" provision purports to exclude liability for negligence.
- Wong Kee’s agreement to or awareness of the exclusion clause is not of itself to be taken as indicating its voluntary acceptance of any risk.

3. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 11 Subsection 2:
- Wong Kee is not dealing as a consumer but as a business entity.
- Therefore, this section does not apply.

4. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 12 Subsection 2:
- Wong Kee is not dealing as a consumer but as a business entity.
- Therefore, this section does not apply.

### Conclusion:

Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 7 Subsection 1 and 2 applies. The exclusion clause in the "Seller’s Liability" provision must satisfy the requirement of reasonableness to be valid. Given the circumstances, including the long-standing business relationship and the sudden change in the quality of the crabs supplied, it is likely that a court would find the exclusion clause unreasonable and therefore invalid. Consequently, Neptune cannot exclude liability for the financial losses suffered by Wong Kee due to the supply of baby mud crabs.

## Deductive Reasoning: cfa

### Relevant law:

Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, Cap. 71

### Major Premise:

1. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, Cap. 71

   Conditions:
   - A contract contains a term which would exclude or restrict any liability to which a party to a contract may be subject by reason of any misrepresentation made by him before the contract was made; or
   - Any remedy available to another party to the contract by reason of such a misrepresentation

   Consequences:
   - That term shall be of no effect

   Exceptions:
   - Unless it satisfies the requirement of reasonableness as stated in section 3(1) of the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, Cap.71

   Citation:
   - Green Park Properties Limited v Dorku Limited

### Minor Premise:

1. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, Cap. 71:
- The contract between Wong Kee and Neptune contains a "Seller’s Liability" provision that excludes all liability for any loss or damage arising from any defect in any seafood product supplied, however caused.
- Wong Kee suffered financial losses due to Neptune supplying only baby mud crabs, which were unsuitable for Wong Kee's signature dish.
- The exclusion clause in the "Seller’s Liability" provision would restrict Neptune's liability for the loss suffered by Wong Kee due to the defective product (baby mud crabs).
- According to the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, Cap. 71, such a term shall be of no effect unless it satisfies the requirement of reasonableness.

### Conclusion:

The exclusion clause in the "Seller’s Liability" provision is not valid under the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, Cap. 71, unless Neptune can prove that the clause satisfies the requirement of reasonableness. Given the significant financial loss and the deviation from the expected product quality, it is unlikely that the clause would be deemed reasonable. Therefore, the exclusion clause is likely to be of no effect, and Neptune may be liable for the losses suffered by Wong Kee.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (INVEST GAIN LTD v. NOVEL GOOD LTD)
In the case of INVEST GAIN LTD v. NOVEL GOOD LTD [2019] HKCFI 1633; HCA 939/2013 (precedent p), the court dealt with the issue of whether a notice clause in a contract was a "bald notification" clause or required specific details to be provided. The court ruled that the clause in question was a "bald notification" clause, meaning that a general notice of a claim was sufficient without the need to specify the details of the claim or the basis of such claim.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in INVEST GAIN LTD v. NOVEL GOOD LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Interpretation of Contractual Clauses**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the interpretation of specific clauses within a contract is at issue. In INVEST GAIN LTD v. NOVEL GOOD LTD, it was the interpretation of a notice clause. In our current case, it is the interpretation of an exclusion clause.
- **Legal Concept 2: Exclusion Clauses**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: Both cases involve clauses that potentially limit or exclude liability. In INVEST GAIN LTD v. NOVEL GOOD LTD, the clause in question was argued to be a limitation clause but was found to be an exclusion clause. In our current case, the "Seller’s Liability" provision is an exclusion clause.
- **Legal Concept 3: Business Common Sense**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: The court in INVEST GAIN LTD v. NOVEL GOOD LTD considered whether the natural and ordinary meaning of the clause flouted business common sense. Similarly, in our current case, the interpretation of the exclusion clause should be examined in light of business common sense.
- **Legal Concept 4: Contractual Time-Bar**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In INVEST GAIN LTD v. NOVEL GOOD LTD, the clause imposed a contractual time-bar for claims. In our current case, while not a time-bar, the exclusion clause aims to limit the seller's liability, which has a similar effect of limiting the scope of potential claims.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (INVEST GAIN LTD v. NOVEL GOOD LTD)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a clause that aims to limit or exclude liability (fact pattern i*), the court should decide based on the natural and ordinary meaning of the clause, considering business common sense and the context of the agreement (outcome o). This rule was justified in INVEST GAIN LTD v. NOVEL GOOD LTD because the positive effects (E+) of providing clarity and predictability in business transactions outweighed the negative effects (E-) of potentially limiting the scope of claims. The court emphasized the importance of interpreting contractual clauses in a way that aligns with the reasonable expectations of the parties and the commercial context in which the agreement was made.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (INVEST GAIN LTD v. NOVEL GOOD LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Interpretation of Contractual Clauses**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the interpretation of specific clauses within a contract is at issue. In INVEST GAIN LTD v. NOVEL GOOD LTD, it was the interpretation of a notice clause. In our current case, it is the interpretation of an exclusion clause.
- **Legal Concept 2: Exclusion Clauses**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: Both cases involve clauses that potentially limit or exclude liability. In INVEST GAIN LTD v. NOVEL GOOD LTD, the clause in question was argued to be a limitation clause but was found to be an exclusion clause. In our current case, the "Seller’s Liability" provision is an exclusion clause.
- **Legal Concept 3: Business Common Sense**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: The court in INVEST GAIN LTD v. NOVEL GOOD LTD considered whether the natural and ordinary meaning of the clause flouted business common sense. Similarly, in our current case, the interpretation of the exclusion clause should be examined in light of business common sense.
- **Legal Concept 4: Contractual Time-Bar**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In INVEST GAIN LTD v. NOVEL GOOD LTD, the clause imposed a contractual time-bar for claims. In our current case, while not a time-bar, the exclusion clause aims to limit the seller's liability, which has a similar effect of limiting the scope of potential claims.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in INVEST GAIN LTD v. NOVEL GOOD LTD, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Clarity and Predictability in Business Transactions**: Just as in the precedent case, interpreting the exclusion clause in a way that aligns with its natural and ordinary meaning would provide clarity and predictability for both parties. This is crucial in commercial relationships where parties need to understand their rights and obligations clearly to make informed business decisions.

2. **Alignment with Business Common Sense**: The court in the precedent case emphasized the importance of business common sense in interpreting contractual clauses. In our current case, interpreting the exclusion clause to mean that Neptune is not liable for any defects in the seafood supplied, as long as the clause is clear and unambiguous, aligns with the commercial reality that suppliers often seek to limit their liability to manage risks effectively.

3. **Respect for Contractual Autonomy**: Both cases involve sophisticated commercial parties who negotiated the terms of their agreements. Upholding the exclusion clause respects the parties' autonomy to allocate risks as they see fit. This is particularly important in commercial contracts where parties are presumed to have equal bargaining power and the ability to negotiate terms that reflect their respective interests.

4. **Consistency with Legal Principles**: The precedent case established that exclusion clauses should be interpreted based on their natural and ordinary meaning, considering the context and purpose of the agreement. Applying this principle consistently ensures that similar cases are treated alike, promoting fairness and legal certainty.

Given these positive effects, we submit that the court should interpret the "Seller’s Liability" provision in the current case as a valid exclusion clause under the Unfair Contract Terms Ordinance (Cap. 71) in Hong Kong. This interpretation would provide clarity, align with business common sense, respect contractual autonomy, and ensure consistency with established legal principles.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **INVEST GAIN LTD v. NOVEL GOOD LTD**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of a **"bald notification" clause**. This concept was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as providing clarity and predictability in business transactions, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it allowed for a general notice of a claim without the need for specific details, which aligned with business common sense and the commercial context of the agreement.

However, in our current case, this crucial **"bald notification" clause** is notably absent. Instead, we are dealing with an **exclusion clause** in the "Seller’s Liability" provision, which explicitly seeks to exclude all liability for any loss or damage arising from any defect in any seafood product supplied. The absence of a "bald notification" clause means that the same rationale used in the precedent case cannot be directly applied here, as the exclusion clause in our case is more stringent and specific in its intent to limit liability.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor **(the Unfair Contract Terms Ordinance (Cap. 71))** that was not present in **INVEST GAIN LTD v. NOVEL GOOD LTD**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the Unfair Contract Terms Ordinance (UCTO) imposes statutory controls on exclusion clauses, particularly in consumer and commercial contracts, to prevent unfair terms.

Due to the presence of the UCTO, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as potentially upholding an unfair exclusion clause that could leave Wong Kee without any remedy for the defective crabs supplied by Neptune. Unlike in **INVEST GAIN LTD v. NOVEL GOOD LTD**, where the focus was on the sufficiency of notice under a "bald notification" clause, the current case requires a careful examination of the fairness and reasonableness of the exclusion clause under the UCTO. This statutory framework aims to protect parties from unfair contractual terms, and thus, the exclusion clause in our case must be scrutinized to ensure it does not contravene the principles of fairness and reasonableness mandated by the UCTO.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **INVEST GAIN LTD v. NOVEL GOOD LTD** should be stated as: "When both [the interpretation of contractual clauses] and [the presence of a statutory framework like the Unfair Contract Terms Ordinance (Cap. 71)] are present, the court should decide [based on the fairness and reasonableness of the clause under the statutory framework]." Omitting [the presence of a statutory framework like the Unfair Contract Terms Ordinance (Cap. 71)] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of upholding unfair exclusion clauses that leave one party without any remedy for defects, thus contravening the principles of fairness and reasonableness mandated by the UCTO].

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **INVEST GAIN LTD v. NOVEL GOOD LTD** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties being unable to rely on general notices of claims, thus ensuring clarity and predictability in business transactions]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [parties being unable to rely on general notices of claims] occurring. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the focus should be on ensuring that the exclusion clause complies with the fairness and reasonableness requirements of the Unfair Contract Terms Ordinance (Cap. 71).

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the "bald notification" clause, which was present in the precedent case **INVEST GAIN LTD v. NOVEL GOOD LTD**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of interpreting exclusion clauses would lead to the undesirable consequence of potentially upholding unfair exclusion clauses that leave one party without any remedy for defects. Conversely, not requiring the "bald notification" clause would allow for a more nuanced and fair assessment of exclusion clauses under the Unfair Contract Terms Ordinance (Cap. 71), which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and reasonableness in contract law. This approach ensures that exclusion clauses are scrutinized to prevent unfair terms, thereby protecting the interests of both parties in a commercial contract.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the "bald notification" clause, which was present in **INVEST GAIN LTD v. NOVEL GOOD LTD**, we have the additional factor of the Unfair Contract Terms Ordinance (Cap. 71). This statutory framework, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of interpreting exclusion clauses, serves a similar function to the "bald notification" clause in the precedent case. Given the presence of the UCTO, we submit that the reasoning in **INVEST GAIN LTD v. NOVEL GOOD LTD** still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as fairness, reasonableness, and protection against unfair contractual terms would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. The UCTO ensures that exclusion clauses are not enforced if they are found to be unfair or unreasonable, thereby providing a balanced and just outcome in line with the principles of contract law.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **INVEST GAIN LTD v. NOVEL GOOD LTD**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the interpretation of contractual clauses and the presence of exclusion clauses. However, it also differs significantly in the absence of a "bald notification" clause and the presence of the Unfair Contract Terms Ordinance (UCTO) in Hong Kong.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case, which emphasizes the natural and ordinary meaning of the clause considering business common sense and the context of the agreement, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the UCTO, which imposes statutory controls on exclusion clauses to prevent unfair terms.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point from the initial analogy that clarity and predictability in business transactions are crucial, and the counterargument that the UCTO requires a careful examination of the fairness and reasonableness of the exclusion clause.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, reasonableness, and the protection against unfair contractual terms mandated by the UCTO, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the exclusion clause in the "Seller’s Liability" provision should be scrutinized under the UCTO. This ensures that the clause does not contravene the principles of fairness and reasonableness.

Therefore, the exclusion clause in the current case should not be automatically upheld. Instead, it should be examined to determine whether it is fair and reasonable under the UCTO. This approach aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency, ensuring that exclusion clauses are not enforced if they are found to be unfair or unreasonable.

In conclusion, the court should interpret the "Seller’s Liability" provision in the current case in light of the Unfair Contract Terms Ordinance (Cap. 71) in Hong Kong, ensuring that the exclusion clause complies with the statutory requirements of fairness and reasonableness. This decision is reached by balancing the need for clarity and predictability in business transactions with the statutory protections against unfair contractual terms, thereby providing a just and legally consistent outcome.


# Contract Law: Whether Wong Kee can claim damages for financial losses and reputational damage due to the delivery of unsuitable crabs

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Sections 32, 53, and 55

### Major Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 32

   Conditions:
   - The seller delivers to the buyer a quantity of goods less than he contracted to sell
   - The seller delivers to the buyer a quantity of goods larger than he contracted to sell
   - The seller delivers to the buyer the goods he contracted to sell mixed with goods of a different description not included in the contract

   Consequences:
   - The buyer may reject them, but if the buyer accepts the goods so delivered, he must pay for them at the contract rate
   - The buyer may accept the goods included in the contract and reject the rest, or he may reject the whole
   - The buyer may accept the goods which are in accordance with the contract and reject the rest, or he may reject the whole

   Exceptions:
   - The provisions of this section are subject to any usage of trade, special agreement, or course of dealing between the parties

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 53

   Conditions:
   - The seller wrongfully neglects or refuses to deliver the goods to the buyer
   - The buyer maintains an action against the seller for damages for non-delivery

   Consequences:
   - The measure of damages is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the seller’s breach of contract
   - Where there is an available market for the goods in question, the measure of damages is prima facie to be ascertained by the difference between the contract price and the market or current price of the goods at the time or times when they ought to have been delivered, or, if no time was fixed for delivery, then at the time of the neglect or refusal to deliver

   Exceptions:
   - None

3. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 55

   Conditions:
   - There is a breach of warranty by the seller
   - The buyer elects, or is compelled, to treat any breach of a condition on the part of the seller as a breach of warranty

   Consequences:
   - The buyer is not entitled to reject the goods by reason only of such breach of warranty
   - The buyer may set up against the seller the breach of warranty in diminution or extinction of the price
   - The buyer may maintain an action against the seller for damages for the breach of warranty
   - The measure of damages for breach of warranty is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the breach of warranty
   - In the case of breach of warranty of quality, such loss is prima facie the difference between the value of the goods at the time of delivery to the buyer and the value they would have had if they had answered to the warranty
   - The fact that the buyer has set up the breach of warranty in diminution or extinction of the price does not prevent him from maintaining an action for the same breach of warranty if he has suffered further damage

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 32:
   - Neptune delivered to Wong Kee a quantity of goods (baby mud crabs) that did not conform to the usual mix of sizes expected and required for the "Typhoon Shelter Crab" dish.
   - Wong Kee did not reject the goods upon delivery but later found them unsuitable for their signature dish.
   - The course of dealing between Wong Kee and Neptune, including the informal agreement and the draft contract, indicates that the mix of sizes should conform to the norms and practices of the seafood trade.

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 53:
   - Neptune did not wrongfully neglect or refuse to deliver the goods; they delivered baby mud crabs instead of the usual mix.
   - Wong Kee is not maintaining an action for non-delivery but for the delivery of unsuitable goods.

3. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 55:
   - There is a breach of warranty by Neptune as the crabs delivered did not meet the expected quality and size mix.
   - Wong Kee may maintain an action against Neptune for damages for the breach of warranty.
   - The measure of damages for breach of warranty is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting from the breach, which includes financial losses and reputational damage due to the inability to serve the signature dish.

### Conclusion:

Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 55 applies, and Wong Kee can claim damages for financial losses and reputational damage due to the delivery of unsuitable crabs by Neptune.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (CACV 126/2011)
In the case of CACV 126/2011 between Wing Tat Haberdashery Company Limited (Plaintiff) and Elegance Development & Industrial Co. Limited (Defendant) (precedent p), the plaintiff claimed for the balance of the price of goods sold and delivered, while the defendant counterclaimed for damages due to defective goods. The court ruled that the defendant was entitled to its counterclaim in full because the judge had not properly quantified the damages and had arbitrarily halved the counterclaim without sufficient evidential basis. The final judgment was in favor of the defendant for the sum of $127,596.78.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in CACV 126/2011 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Breach of Contract**: 
  - *Fact Pattern 1*: In CACV 126/2011, the defendant claimed that the goods supplied were defective and did not conform to the contract. In the current case, Wong Kee claims that the crabs supplied were unsuitable and did not conform to the expected quality and size distribution norms.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Measure of Damages**:
  - *Fact Pattern 2*: In CACV 126/2011, the court discussed the measure of damages for breach of warranty under the Sale of Goods Ordinance, focusing on the direct and natural loss resulting from the breach. In the current case, Wong Kee seeks damages for financial losses and reputational damage due to the delivery of unsuitable crabs.
  
- **Legal Concept 3: Duty to Mitigate Loss**:
  - *Fact Pattern 3*: In CACV 126/2011, the court considered whether the defendant had taken reasonable steps to mitigate its loss. In the current case, the issue may arise as to whether Wong Kee took reasonable steps to mitigate its losses upon receiving the unsuitable crabs.
  
- **Legal Concept 4: Exclusion Clauses**:
  - *Fact Pattern 4*: In CACV 126/2011, the court did not specifically address exclusion clauses, but the principle of whether such clauses can exclude liability for defective goods is relevant. In the current case, Neptune included a "Seller’s Liability" provision attempting to exclude liability for any loss or damage arising from defects.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (CACV 126/2011)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a breach of contract involving the supply of defective goods (i*), the court should decide in favor of the party suffering the loss for the full measure of damages directly and naturally resulting from the breach (outcome o). This rule was justified in CACV 126/2011 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that parties are compensated for their actual losses and that damages are properly quantified outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially encouraging frivolous claims. This rule upholds the underlying values of fairness and proper compensation in contract law.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (CACV 126/2011) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Breach of Contract**:
  - *Fact Pattern 1*: In CACV 126/2011, the defendant claimed that the goods supplied were defective and did not conform to the contract. In the current case, Wong Kee claims that the crabs supplied were unsuitable and did not conform to the expected quality and size distribution norms.

- **Legal Concept 2: Measure of Damages**:
  - *Fact Pattern 2*: In CACV 126/2011, the court discussed the measure of damages for breach of warranty under the Sale of Goods Ordinance, focusing on the direct and natural loss resulting from the breach. In the current case, Wong Kee seeks damages for financial losses and reputational damage due to the delivery of unsuitable crabs.

- **Legal Concept 3: Duty to Mitigate Loss**:
  - *Fact Pattern 3*: In CACV 126/2011, the court considered whether the defendant had taken reasonable steps to mitigate its loss. In the current case, the issue may arise as to whether Wong Kee took reasonable steps to mitigate its losses upon receiving the unsuitable crabs.

- **Legal Concept 4: Exclusion Clauses**:
  - *Fact Pattern 4*: In CACV 126/2011, the court did not specifically address exclusion clauses, but the principle of whether such clauses can exclude liability for defective goods is relevant. In the current case, Neptune included a "Seller’s Liability" provision attempting to exclude liability for any loss or damage arising from defects.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in CACV 126/2011. This decision would be justified because, as in CACV 126/2011, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Proper Compensation**: Just as in CACV 126/2011, awarding damages to Wong Kee for the financial losses and reputational damage directly and naturally resulting from the breach would ensure that Wong Kee is properly compensated for its actual losses. This upholds the principle of fairness in contract law.

2. **Encouraging Compliance with Contractual Obligations**: By holding Neptune accountable for supplying unsuitable crabs, the court would reinforce the importance of adhering to contractual obligations. This would deter suppliers from delivering substandard goods and encourage them to meet the agreed-upon standards.

3. **Clarifying the Limits of Exclusion Clauses**: Addressing the "Seller’s Liability" provision in Neptune's contract would clarify the limits of exclusion clauses in similar cases. This would provide guidance to businesses on the enforceability of such clauses and ensure that they do not unfairly absolve suppliers from liability for defective goods.

4. **Promoting Reasonable Mitigation Efforts**: By considering whether Wong Kee took reasonable steps to mitigate its losses, the court would promote the principle that parties should act reasonably to minimize their damages. This would encourage businesses to take proactive measures when faced with defective goods, thereby reducing overall losses.

In conclusion, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns as CACV 126/2011, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in CACV 126/2011, it would ensure proper compensation, encourage compliance with contractual obligations, clarify the limits of exclusion clauses, and promote reasonable mitigation efforts.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case CACV 126/2011, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the judge had not properly quantified the damages and had arbitrarily halved the counterclaim without sufficient evidential basis. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—proper compensation for actual losses and the encouragement of accurate damage quantification—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it upheld the principles of fairness and proper compensation in contract law. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of arbitrary damage quantification is notably absent as the issue revolves around the suitability of the crabs delivered and the presence of an exclusion clause, rather than an arbitrary reduction of damages.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—the presence of an exclusion clause in the contract—that was not present in CACV 126/2011. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of breach of contract involving the supply of defective goods. Because of the exclusion clause, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences than positive ones, unlike in CACV 126/2011. The exclusion clause attempts to absolve Neptune of liability for any loss or damage arising from defects, which could potentially limit Wong Kee's ability to claim damages. This clause introduces a significant legal consideration that was not addressed in the precedent case, thereby altering the balance of positive and negative effects. The court must now consider the enforceability and scope of the exclusion clause, which could lead to a different outcome than simply awarding damages for the breach.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from CACV 126/2011 should be stated as "When both [i*] (breach of contract involving the supply of defective goods) and [m] (the presence of an exclusion clause) are present, the court should decide [o] (to carefully evaluate the enforceability of the exclusion clause and the extent of damages recoverable)." Omitting [m] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q] (unfairly absolving suppliers from liability for defective goods, thereby encouraging the supply of substandard products). Indeed, the opinion in CACV 126/2011 implicitly highlights the importance of properly quantifying damages and ensuring that parties are compensated for their actual losses, which would be undermined if exclusion clauses were allowed to blanketly absolve liability without scrutiny.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in CACV 126/2011 was clearly designed to prevent [undesirable consequence u] (arbitrary reduction of damages without sufficient evidential basis, leading to unfair compensation). However, in our current case, there's no risk of [u] occurring because the issue revolves around the suitability of the crabs delivered and the presence of an exclusion clause, rather than an arbitrary reduction of damages. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should focus on the enforceability of the exclusion clause and whether it unfairly limits Wong Kee's ability to claim damages for the unsuitable crabs.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of arbitrary damage quantification (m), which was present in the precedent case CACV 126/2011, requiring this factor for all similar cases of breach of contract involving the supply of defective goods (i*) would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would mean that courts could only award full damages in cases where there was an arbitrary reduction of damages, thereby ignoring other significant factors such as the presence of exclusion clauses that attempt to limit liability. Conversely, not requiring the arbitrary damage quantification factor (m) would allow for a more comprehensive evaluation of the circumstances, including the enforceability of exclusion clauses. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which aim to ensure fairness and proper compensation for actual losses while also scrutinizing the validity and scope of exclusion clauses to prevent unjust outcomes.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of arbitrary damage quantification (m), which was present in CACV 126/2011, we have the additional factor of an exclusion clause (n). This exclusion clause, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of breach of contract involving the supply of defective goods (i*), serves a similar function to the arbitrary damage quantification factor (m) in the precedent case. Given the presence of the exclusion clause (n), we submit that the reasoning in CACV 126/2011 still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values—such as ensuring proper compensation, encouraging compliance with contractual obligations, and promoting reasonable mitigation efforts—would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. The court should carefully evaluate the enforceability of the exclusion clause and the extent of damages recoverable, ensuring that Wong Kee is fairly compensated for its actual losses while maintaining the integrity of contractual obligations.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to CACV 126/2011, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the breach of contract involving the supply of defective goods and the measure of damages for such breaches. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the presence of an exclusion clause in the current case, which was not a factor in CACV 126/2011.

The proposed legal rule from CACV 126/2011—that the court should decide in favor of the party suffering the loss for the full measure of damages directly and naturally resulting from the breach—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the exclusion clause in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the exclusion clause introduces a significant legal consideration that could limit Wong Kee's ability to claim damages (raised in the rebuttal), and the counterargument that the exclusion clause should be carefully evaluated for its enforceability and fairness (raised in the surrebuttal).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, proper compensation, and the enforceability of contractual terms, we conclude that the court should carefully evaluate the enforceability of the exclusion clause in Neptune's contract. This evaluation should determine whether the clause unfairly limits Wong Kee's ability to claim damages for the unsuitable crabs. If the exclusion clause is found to be enforceable and fair, Wong Kee's claim for damages may be limited. However, if the clause is deemed unfair or overly broad, Wong Kee should be entitled to full compensation for its financial losses and reputational damage.

In conclusion, the decision reached is that the court should:

1. Evaluate the enforceability and fairness of the exclusion clause in Neptune's contract.
2. Determine the extent of damages recoverable by Wong Kee based on this evaluation.
3. Ensure that Wong Kee is fairly compensated for its actual losses while maintaining the integrity of contractual obligations.

This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency, taking into account the unique factors present in the current case.


# Contract Law: Whether the 'minimum quantity' clause requiring Wong Kee to order at least 1000 kilograms per week is enforceable

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA012172/1996)
In the case of HCA012172/1996 between Safe Steel Furniture Factory Limited (Plaintiff) and Lamex Trading Company Limited (Defendant) (precedent p), the court ruled that the agreement between the parties was not for an indefinite term. The court found that the provisions for the obligations and rights of the parties were only up to 1994, and there was no mechanism in place to extend these provisions beyond that period. The court also held that any implied term that the quantity of goods to be ordered after 1994 would be subject to negotiation was void for uncertainty.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA012172/1996 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Duration of Agreement**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (p)**: The agreement did not specify a duration, leading to a dispute over whether it was for an indefinite term.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (c)**: The dealings between Wong Kee and Neptune were conducted on an informal basis without a formalized contract specifying the duration until June 2018.

- **Legal Concept 2: Minimum Quantity Clause**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (p)**: The agreement specified minimum quantities for the years 1992 to 1994, but there was no provision for quantities beyond 1994.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (c)**: Neptune added a "minimum quantity" clause requiring Wong Kee to order at least 1000 kilograms per week.

- **Legal Concept 3: Implied Terms and Uncertainty**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (p)**: The court found that any implied term regarding the quantity of goods to be ordered after 1994 was void for uncertainty.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (c)**: The amended agreement proposed by Neptune included specific terms, but the formal contract was not signed, leading to potential uncertainty about the enforceability of the "minimum quantity" clause.

- **Legal Concept 4: Exclusivity and Supply**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (p)**: The agreement did not require the Defendant to obtain goods exclusively from the Plaintiff.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (c)**: Wong Kee had been purchasing crabs exclusively from Neptune since June 2013, but this exclusivity was not formalized in a signed contract.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA012172/1996)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern where an agreement does not specify a duration and includes terms that are subject to future negotiation, the court should decide that such terms are void for uncertainty. This rule was justified in HCA012172/1996 because the positive effects (E+) of outcome o on the underlying values and principles of the law, such as contractual certainty and enforceability, outweigh the negative effects (E-) in that case. The court emphasized the importance of having clear and definite terms in a contract to avoid disputes and ensure that both parties understand their obligations and rights.

Applying this rule to the current case, the "minimum quantity" clause requiring Wong Kee to order at least 1000 kilograms per week may be considered void for uncertainty if the formal contract was not signed and there was no clear agreement on this term. The informal nature of the dealings and the lack of a signed contract could lead to the conclusion that the clause is not enforceable, similar to the outcome in HCA012172/1996.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA012172/1996) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Duration of Agreement**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (p)**: The agreement did not specify a duration, leading to a dispute over whether it was for an indefinite term.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (c)**: The dealings between Wong Kee and Neptune were conducted on an informal basis without a formalized contract specifying the duration until June 2018.

- **Legal Concept 2: Minimum Quantity Clause**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (p)**: The agreement specified minimum quantities for the years 1992 to 1994, but there was no provision for quantities beyond 1994.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (c)**: Neptune added a "minimum quantity" clause requiring Wong Kee to order at least 1000 kilograms per week.

- **Legal Concept 3: Implied Terms and Uncertainty**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (p)**: The court found that any implied term regarding the quantity of goods to be ordered after 1994 was void for uncertainty.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (c)**: The amended agreement proposed by Neptune included specific terms, but the formal contract was not signed, leading to potential uncertainty about the enforceability of the "minimum quantity" clause.

- **Legal Concept 4: Exclusivity and Supply**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (p)**: The agreement did not require the Defendant to obtain goods exclusively from the Plaintiff.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (c)**: Wong Kee had been purchasing crabs exclusively from Neptune since June 2013, but this exclusivity was not formalized in a signed contract.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCA012172/1996. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Contractual Certainty**: Enforcing the rule that terms subject to future negotiation are void for uncertainty ensures that contracts are clear and definite. This helps both parties understand their obligations and rights, reducing the likelihood of disputes.

2. **Enforceability**: By requiring that essential terms such as minimum quantities and duration be clearly defined, the court upholds the principle that contracts must be enforceable. This protects the integrity of contractual agreements and ensures that parties cannot be held to vague or indefinite terms.

3. **Fairness**: Applying this rule prevents one party from being unfairly bound by terms that were not clearly agreed upon. In this case, Wong Kee should not be held to a "minimum quantity" clause that was never formalized in a signed contract, especially given the informal nature of their dealings.

4. **Commercial Reasonableness**: The decision promotes commercial reasonableness by ensuring that parties cannot rely on informal understandings to impose significant obligations. This encourages businesses to formalize their agreements, leading to more predictable and stable commercial relationships.

Given these positive effects, we submit that the court should find the "minimum quantity" clause requiring Wong Kee to order at least 1000 kilograms per week to be void for uncertainty, just as it did in HCA012172/1996. This would uphold the underlying values and principles of contract law, ensuring clarity, enforceability, fairness, and commercial reasonableness.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA012172/1996, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the agreement explicitly specified minimum quantities for the years 1992 to 1994, but there was no provision for quantities beyond 1994. This explicit specification of quantities was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—such as contractual certainty and enforceability—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided a clear framework for the parties' obligations and rights up to a certain point. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of explicitly specified quantities for a defined period is notably absent. The dealings between Wong Kee and Neptune were conducted on an informal basis without a formalized contract specifying the duration or minimum quantities until June 2018. This lack of explicit specification creates a different context for assessing the enforceability of the "minimum quantity" clause.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—the continuous and uninterrupted transactions between Wong Kee and Neptune from June 2013 to November 2020—that was not present in HCA012172/1996. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it demonstrates a long-standing and consistent business relationship, which could imply a mutual understanding and acceptance of certain terms, even if not formally documented. Due to this continuous relationship, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as undermining the stability and predictability of long-term business relationships, than positive ones, unlike in HCA012172/1996. The precedent case did not involve such an extended period of consistent dealings, which makes the context of our current case unique and necessitates a different legal consideration.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA012172/1996 should be stated as: "When both the agreement does not specify a duration and includes terms that are subject to future negotiation, and there is no continuous and uninterrupted business relationship demonstrating mutual understanding and acceptance of terms, the court should decide that such terms are void for uncertainty." Omitting the continuous and uninterrupted business relationship from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of undermining the stability and predictability of long-term business relationships. Indeed, the opinion in HCA012172/1996 explicitly states that the lack of a mechanism to extend the provisions beyond 1994 was crucial to their decision, highlighting the importance of clear and definite terms in the absence of a long-standing business relationship.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA012172/1996 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of contractual uncertainty and unenforceability due to vague or indefinite terms. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because the continuous and uninterrupted transactions between Wong Kee and Neptune from June 2013 to November 2020 demonstrate a mutual understanding and acceptance of certain terms, even if not formally documented. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—preventing uncertainty and unenforceability—is not relevant to our situation given the long-standing and consistent business relationship between the parties.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the explicit specification of minimum quantities for a defined period, which was present in the precedent case HCA012172/1996, requiring this factor for all similar cases of informal agreements would lead to the undesirable consequence of undermining long-standing business relationships that have operated smoothly and predictably over time. Conversely, not requiring the explicit specification of minimum quantities would allow for the recognition of mutual understandings and established practices in long-term business relationships, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, such as the intention of the parties and the stability of commercial dealings.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the explicit specification of minimum quantities for a defined period, which was present in HCA012172/1996, we have the additional factor of continuous and uninterrupted transactions between Wong Kee and Neptune from June 2013 to November 2020. This continuous relationship, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of informal dealings and mutual understandings, serves a similar function to the explicit specification of quantities in the precedent case. Given the presence of this long-standing business relationship, we submit that the reasoning in HCA012172/1996 still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as contractual certainty, enforceability, and the recognition of established commercial practices, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA012172/1996, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the informal nature of the dealings and the lack of a formalized contract specifying the duration or minimum quantities. However, it also differs significantly in that there was a continuous and uninterrupted business relationship between Wong Kee and Neptune from June 2013 to November 2020, which demonstrates a mutual understanding and acceptance of certain terms, even if not formally documented.

The proposed legal rule from HCA012172/1996, which states that terms subject to future negotiation are void for uncertainty, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in the context of long-standing business relationships. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of contractual certainty and enforceability (as emphasized in the precedent) and the need to recognize established commercial practices and mutual understandings in long-term business relationships (as argued in the current case).

Considering the underlying legal principles of contractual certainty, enforceability, and the recognition of established commercial practices, we conclude that the "minimum quantity" clause requiring Wong Kee to order at least 1000 kilograms per week should not be considered void for uncertainty. The continuous and uninterrupted transactions between Wong Kee and Neptune provide sufficient evidence of a mutual understanding and acceptance of this term, even in the absence of a formalized contract.

Therefore, the decision reached is that the "minimum quantity" clause is enforceable, given the long-standing and consistent business relationship between the parties, which aligns with the principles of fairness and commercial reasonableness. This decision serves justice and legal consistency by recognizing the practical realities of long-term business dealings while upholding the importance of clear and definite terms in contractual agreements.

### Minor Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 57 Subsection 1:
- A right, duty or liability would arise under the contract of sale of crabs by implication of law.
- There is a course of dealing between Wong Kee and Neptune, and a usage that binds both parties to the contract regarding the distribution of crab sizes.
- Therefore, the implied right, duty or liability may be negatived or varied, subject to the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 71).

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 57 Subsection 2:
- An express condition exists in the draft contract (Neptune's absolute discretion to determine the size of mud crabs).
- There is an implied condition by the Sale of Goods Ordinance regarding the distribution of crab sizes.
- The express condition (Neptune's discretion) is inconsistent with the implied condition (distribution norms).
- Therefore, the express condition negatives the implied condition.

3. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 8 Subsection 2:
- A right, duty or liability would arise under the contract for the supply of crabs by virtue of the Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance.
- There is a course of dealing between Wong Kee and Neptune, and a usage that binds both parties to the contract regarding the distribution of crab sizes.
- Therefore, the implied right, duty or liability may be negatived or varied, subject to subsection (3) and the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 71).

4. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 8 Subsection 3:
- An express term exists in the draft contract (Neptune's absolute discretion to determine the size of mud crabs).
- There is a term implied by the Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance regarding the distribution of crab sizes.
- The express term (Neptune's discretion) is inconsistent with the implied term (distribution norms).
- Therefore, the express term negatives the implied term.

### Conclusion:

The 'sole and only agreement' clause in the draft contract, which includes Neptune's absolute discretion to determine the size of mud crabs, supersedes the prior informal agreement and course of dealings. The express terms in the draft contract are inconsistent with the implied terms regarding the distribution of crab sizes, and thus, the express terms negative the implied terms. Therefore, Wong Kee cannot rely on the prior course of dealings or implied terms to claim a breach of contract by Neptune.

### Major Premise:

1. Glory Gold Limited v Star Play Development Limited

   Conditions:
   - The agreement contains an 'entire agreement clause' that states the agreement constitutes the sole and only agreement of the parties and supersedes any prior understandings or agreements, whether oral or written, between the parties respecting the subject matter.
   - The clause is intended to ensure that the full contractual terms to which the parties agreed to bind themselves are to be found in the agreement itself and nowhere else such as in a side agreement or a collateral warranty.

   Consequences:
   - The full contractual terms are to be found in the document containing the clauses and not elsewhere.
   - Any promises or assurances made in the course of negotiation shall have no contractual force, save insofar as they are reflected and given effect in that document.

   Exceptions:
   - The claim is based on misrepresentation, as the entire agreement clause does not preclude a claim in misrepresentation.

### Minor Premise:

1. The draft contract between Wong Kee and Neptune contains an 'entire agreement clause' that states the agreement constitutes the sole and only agreement of the parties and supersedes any prior understandings or agreements, whether oral or written, between the parties respecting the subject matter.
2. The clause is intended to ensure that the full contractual terms to which Wong Kee and Neptune agreed to bind themselves are to be found in the agreement itself and nowhere else such as in a side agreement or a collateral warranty.

4. Any promises or assurances made in the course of negotiation shall have no contractual force, save insofar as they are reflected and given effect in that document.
5. The claim is not based on misrepresentation.

### Conclusion:

The 'sole and only agreement' clause in the draft contract supersedes the prior informal agreement and course of dealings between Wong Kee and Neptune. Therefore, the full contractual terms are to be found in the draft contract, and any prior promises or assurances made during negotiations have no contractual force unless they are reflected in the draft contract.

NG YIN LAM [2021] HKCFI 435; HCA 1415/2017 (22 February 2021) (precedent p), the court ruled that the "entire agreement" clause in the Independent Contractor Agreement (ICA) did not supersede the Guarantee. The court found that the Guarantee and the ICA were part of a composite transaction and intended to co-exist, each having its own effect. The court emphasized that the context and purpose of the contractual terms, as well as the factual matrix and commercial object, should be considered in the construction of the "entire agreement" clause.

Both in YUANTA SECURITIES (HONG KONG) CO LTD v. NG YIN LAM and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Entire Agreement Clause**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In both cases, there is an "entire agreement" clause that purports to supersede prior agreements. In YUANTA, the clause was in the ICA, and in the current case, it is in the draft contract between Wong Kee and Neptune.

- **Legal Concept 2: Composite Transaction**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** Both cases involve multiple documents or agreements that were intended to be part of a composite transaction. In YUANTA, the Guarantee and the ICA were part of a composite transaction. In the current case, the informal agreement and the draft contract are part of the ongoing business relationship between Wong Kee and Neptune.

- **Legal Concept 3: Course of Dealings**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** Both cases involve a history of dealings between the parties that inform the interpretation of the contractual terms. In YUANTA, the history of dealings was between Ms. Ng and Yuanta. In the current case, the history of dealings is between Wong Kee and Neptune.

- **Legal Concept 4: Commercial Purpose and Context**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** In both cases, the court considers the commercial purpose and context of the agreements. In YUANTA, the court looked at the purpose of the Guarantee and the ICA. In the current case, the court would consider the purpose of the informal agreement and the draft contract in ensuring a steady supply of crabs to Wong Kee.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (YUANTA SECURITIES (HONG KONG) CO LTD v. NG YIN LAM)

This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern involving an "entire agreement" clause, a composite transaction, a course of dealings, and the commercial purpose and context, the court should decide that the "entire agreement" clause does not necessarily supersede prior informal agreements or course of dealings. This rule was justified in YUANTA SECURITIES (HONG KONG) CO LTD v. NG YIN LAM because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that the true commercial intent and context of the parties' agreements are honored outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially undermining the literal wording of the "entire agreement" clause. The court's decision in YUANTA emphasized the importance of understanding the full context and purpose behind the agreements, which is crucial for achieving fair and just outcomes in commercial disputes.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (YUANTA SECURITIES (HONG KONG) CO LTD v. NG YIN LAM) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Entire Agreement Clause**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In both cases, there is an "entire agreement" clause that purports to supersede prior agreements. In YUANTA, the clause was in the ICA, and in the current case, it is in the draft contract between Wong Kee and Neptune.

- **Legal Concept 2: Composite Transaction**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** Both cases involve multiple documents or agreements that were intended to be part of a composite transaction. In YUANTA, the Guarantee and the ICA were part of a composite transaction. In the current case, the informal agreement and the draft contract are part of the ongoing business relationship between Wong Kee and Neptune.

- **Legal Concept 3: Course of Dealings**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** Both cases involve a history of dealings between the parties that inform the interpretation of the contractual terms. In YUANTA, the history of dealings was between Ms. Ng and Yuanta. In the current case, the history of dealings is between Wong Kee and Neptune.

- **Legal Concept 4: Commercial Purpose and Context**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** In both cases, the court considers the commercial purpose and context of the agreements. In YUANTA, the court looked at the purpose of the Guarantee and the ICA. In the current case, the court would consider the purpose of the informal agreement and the draft contract in ensuring a steady supply of crabs to Wong Kee.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in YUANTA SECURITIES (HONG KONG) CO LTD v. NG YIN LAM. This decision would be justified because, as in YUANTA, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Honoring True Commercial Intent and Context:** By recognizing that the informal agreement and the draft contract are part of a composite transaction, the court would ensure that the true commercial intent and context of the parties' agreements are honored. This respects the ongoing business relationship and the mutual understanding that has developed over time.

2. **Ensuring Fairness and Predictability:** Allowing the informal agreement and course of dealings to inform the interpretation of the "entire agreement" clause would ensure fairness and predictability in commercial transactions. Businesses can rely on their established practices and understandings, even if not formally documented, which is crucial for maintaining trust and stability in commercial relationships.

3. **Avoiding Unjust Outcomes:** Strictly enforcing the "entire agreement" clause to the exclusion of the prior informal agreement and course of dealings could lead to unjust outcomes, such as Wong Kee being unfairly penalized for Neptune's sudden change in the composition of crabs supplied. This would undermine the principles of equity and good faith in commercial dealings.

4. **Promoting Commercial Efficiency:** Recognizing the composite nature of the transaction and the course of dealings would promote commercial efficiency by reducing the need for overly formalistic documentation of every aspect of a business relationship. This is particularly important in industries where informal agreements and practices are common and necessary for operational flexibility.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in YUANTA SECURITIES (HONG KONG) CO LTD v. NG YIN LAM. This decision would be justified because, as in YUANTA, it would have the positive effects of honoring the true commercial intent and context, ensuring fairness and predictability, avoiding unjust outcomes, and promoting commercial efficiency.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case YUANTA SECURITIES (HONG KONG) CO LTD v. NG YIN LAM, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the Guarantee and the ICA were part of a composite transaction. This composite transaction was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—honoring the true commercial intent and context of the parties' agreements—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it recognized the interconnected nature of the agreements and the mutual understanding between the parties. However, in our current case, this crucial composite transaction factor is notably absent as the draft contract between Wong Kee and Neptune was never formally executed and returned, and the informal agreement was not explicitly tied to the draft contract in the same manner as the Guarantee and ICA were in YUANTA.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—the ongoing and uninterrupted course of dealings between Wong Kee and Neptune—that was not present in YUANTA SECURITIES (HONG KONG) CO LTD v. NG YIN LAM. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the continuous and consistent transactions between Wong Kee and Neptune, even after the draft contract was sent but not signed, indicate a mutual understanding and acceptance of the terms proposed in the draft contract. Due to this ongoing course of dealings, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the established business practices and expectations between the parties than positive ones, unlike in YUANTA SECURITIES (HONG KONG) CO LTD v. NG YIN LAM. This is because the continuous transactions suggest that both parties were operating under the assumption that the terms of the draft contract were in effect, even without formal execution.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **YUANTA SECURITIES (HONG KONG) CO LTD v. NG YIN LAM** should be stated as: "When both [the presence of an 'entire agreement' clause] and [the existence of a composite transaction] are present, the court should decide [that the 'entire agreement' clause does not supersede prior informal agreements or course of dealings]." Omitting [the existence of a composite transaction] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of disregarding the true commercial intent and context of the parties' agreements, thereby undermining established business practices and expectations]. Indeed, the opinion in **YUANTA SECURITIES (HONG KONG) CO LTD v. NG YIN LAM** explicitly states that [the composite nature of the transaction was crucial to their decision, as it ensured that the true commercial intent and context of the parties' agreements were honored].

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **YUANTA SECURITIES (HONG KONG) CO LTD v. NG YIN LAM** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of disregarding the true commercial intent and context of the parties' agreements, thereby undermining established business practices and expectations]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [disregarding the true commercial intent and context] occurring because the continuous and consistent transactions between Wong Kee and Neptune, even after the draft contract was sent but not signed, indicate a mutual understanding and acceptance of the terms proposed in the draft contract. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the formal execution of the draft contract, which was present in the precedent case YUANTA SECURITIES (HONG KONG) CO LTD v. NG YIN LAM, requiring this factor for all similar cases of informal agreements and course of dealings would lead to the undesirable consequence of disregarding the established business practices and mutual understandings that have developed over time between parties. Conversely, not requiring the formal execution would allow for the recognition of the true commercial intent and context of the parties' agreements, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, such as honoring the parties' intentions and ensuring fairness in commercial transactions.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the formal execution of the draft contract, which was present in YUANTA SECURITIES (HONG KONG) CO LTD v. NG YIN LAM, we have the additional factor of an ongoing and uninterrupted course of dealings between Wong Kee and Neptune. This ongoing course of dealings, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of the informal agreement and the draft contract, serves a similar function to the formal execution in the precedent case. Given the presence of this ongoing course of dealings, we submit that the reasoning in YUANTA SECURITIES (HONG KONG) CO LTD v. NG YIN LAM still applies, as the positive effects on honoring the true commercial intent and context, ensuring fairness and predictability, and promoting commercial efficiency would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **YUANTA SECURITIES (HONG KONG) CO LTD v. NG YIN LAM**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of an "entire agreement" clause, a history of dealings between the parties, and the commercial purpose and context of the agreements. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of a formally executed contract in the current case and the ongoing and uninterrupted course of dealings between Wong Kee and Neptune.

The proposed legal rule from **YUANTA SECURITIES (HONG KONG) CO LTD v. NG YIN LAM** suggests that an "entire agreement" clause does not necessarily supersede prior informal agreements or course of dealings when part of a composite transaction. This rule finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the continuous and consistent transactions between Wong Kee and Neptune indicate a mutual understanding and acceptance of the terms proposed in the draft contract, even without formal execution. On the other hand, the absence of a composite transaction in the current case, as emphasized in the rebuttal, is a notable distinction.

Considering the underlying legal principles of honoring the true commercial intent and context, ensuring fairness and predictability, and promoting commercial efficiency, we conclude that the "entire agreement" clause in the draft contract between Wong Kee and Neptune does not supersede the prior informal agreement and course of dealings. This decision aligns with the precedent set in **YUANTA SECURITIES (HONG KONG) CO LTD v. NG YIN LAM** and serves justice by recognizing the established business practices and mutual understandings that have developed over time between the parties.

Therefore, the court should decide that the "entire agreement" clause does not supersede the prior informal agreement and course of dealings between Wong Kee and Neptune. This decision is justified because it honors the true commercial intent and context, ensures fairness and predictability, avoids unjust outcomes, and promotes commercial efficiency.


# Contract Law: Whether Neptune's failure to supply crabs conforming to the norms and practices of the seafood trade constitutes a breach of contract

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Sections 32, 53, and 55

### Major Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 32

   Conditions:
   - The seller delivers to the buyer a quantity of goods less than he contracted to sell
   - The seller delivers to the buyer a quantity of goods larger than he contracted to sell
   - The seller delivers to the buyer the goods he contracted to sell mixed with goods of a different description not included in the contract

   Consequences:
   - The buyer may reject them, but if the buyer accepts the goods so delivered, he must pay for them at the contract rate
   - The buyer may accept the goods included in the contract and reject the rest, or he may reject the whole. If the buyer accepts the whole of the goods so delivered he must pay for them at the contract rate
   - The buyer may accept the goods which are in accordance with the contract and reject the rest, or he may reject the whole

   Exceptions:
   - The provisions of this section are subject to any usage of trade, special agreement, or course of dealing between the parties

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 53

   Conditions:
   - The seller wrongfully neglects or refuses to deliver the goods to the buyer
   - The buyer maintains an action against the seller for damages for non-delivery

   Consequences:
   - The measure of damages is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the seller’s breach of contract
   - Where there is an available market for the goods in question, the measure of damages is prima facie to be ascertained by the difference between the contract price and the market or current price of the goods at the time or times when they ought to have been delivered, or, if no time was fixed for delivery, then at the time of the neglect or refusal to deliver

   Exceptions:
   - None

3. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 55

   Conditions:
   - There is a breach of warranty by the seller
   - The buyer elects, or is compelled, to treat any breach of a condition on the part of the seller as a breach of warranty

   Consequences:
   - The buyer is not, by reason only of such breach of warranty, entitled to reject the goods
   - He may set up against the seller the breach of warranty in diminution or extinction of the price
   - Maintain an action against the seller for damages for the breach of warranty
   - The measure of damages for breach of warranty is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the breach of warranty
   - In the case of breach of warranty of quality, such loss is prima facie the difference between the value of the goods at the time of delivery to the buyer and the value they would have had if they had answered to the warranty

   Exceptions:
   - The buyer has set up the breach of warranty in diminution or extinction of the price, which does not prevent him from maintaining an action for the same breach of warranty if he has suffered further damage

### Minor Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 32:
- Neptune delivered to Wong Kee a quantity of goods (baby mud crabs) that did not conform to the norms and practices of the seafood trade.
- The goods delivered (baby mud crabs) were of a different description than what was typically supplied and expected (adult crabs).
- Wong Kee did not accept the baby mud crabs and suffered financial losses as a result.

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 53:
- Neptune wrongfully neglected to deliver the goods (adult crabs) as per the usual trade norms and practices.
- Wong Kee can maintain an action against Neptune for damages for non-delivery of the expected goods.
- The measure of damages would be the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting from Neptune’s breach of contract.

3. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 55:
- Neptune’s delivery of baby mud crabs instead of adult crabs can be treated as a breach of warranty of quality.
- Wong Kee is not entitled to reject the goods solely based on the breach of warranty but can maintain an action for damages.
- The measure of damages for the breach of warranty is the difference between the value of the baby crabs delivered and the value they would have had if they had answered to the warranty (adult crabs).

### Conclusion:

Neptune's failure to supply crabs conforming to the norms and practices of the seafood trade constitutes a breach of contract under the Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Sections 32, 53, and 55. Wong Kee is entitled to maintain an action for damages for non-delivery and breach of warranty, with the measure of damages being the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting from Neptune’s breach of contract.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCCT 40/2014)
In the case of HCCT 40/2014 (precedent p), the court dealt with an application to set aside an arbitral award on the basis that it would be contrary to public policy to enforce the award. The plaintiff, A, argued that the arbitrator had failed to address a key defence (the Limitation Defence) which was central to the dispute. The court ruled that the failure to address this key issue constituted a serious procedural irregularity and a denial of due process, leading to the setting aside of the arbitral award and its remission to the arbitrator for reconsideration.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCCT 40/2014 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Contractual Obligations and Breach**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In HCCT 40/2014, A was found to have failed to deliver products that met the contractual standards. In our current case, Neptune failed to deliver crabs that conformed to the norms and practices of the seafood trade.
- **Legal Concept 2: Implied Terms and Trade Practices**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** In HCCT 40/2014, the agreement included specific standards that the products had to meet. In our current case, the distribution of crab sizes generally conformed to the norms and practices of the seafood trade, which can be considered an implied term.
- **Legal Concept 3: Failure to Address Key Issues**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In HCCT 40/2014, the arbitrator failed to address the Limitation Defence, a key issue. In our current case, Neptune's failure to supply crabs conforming to trade norms is a key issue that needs to be addressed.
- **Legal Concept 4: Public Policy and Fairness**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** In HCCT 40/2014, the court emphasized the importance of fairness and due process in arbitration. In our current case, fairness and adherence to trade norms are crucial for maintaining trust and predictability in commercial transactions.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCCT 40/2014)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a failure to address key contractual obligations and implied terms based on trade practices, the court should decide that there has been a breach of contract. This rule was justified in HCCT 40/2014 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring fairness, due process, and adherence to contractual and trade norms outweigh the negative effects (E-) of setting aside an arbitral award. Ensuring that key issues are addressed and that trade practices are respected upholds the integrity of commercial transactions and promotes trust in the legal system.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCCT 40/2014) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Contractual Obligations and Breach**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In HCCT 40/2014, A was found to have failed to deliver products that met the contractual standards. In our current case, Neptune failed to deliver crabs that conformed to the norms and practices of the seafood trade.
- **Legal Concept 2: Implied Terms and Trade Practices**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** In HCCT 40/2014, the agreement included specific standards that the products had to meet. In our current case, the distribution of crab sizes generally conformed to the norms and practices of the seafood trade, which can be considered an implied term.
- **Legal Concept 3: Failure to Address Key Issues**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In HCCT 40/2014, the arbitrator failed to address the Limitation Defence, a key issue. In our current case, Neptune's failure to supply crabs conforming to trade norms is a key issue that needs to be addressed.
- **Legal Concept 4: Public Policy and Fairness**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** In HCCT 40/2014, the court emphasized the importance of fairness and due process in arbitration. In our current case, fairness and adherence to trade norms are crucial for maintaining trust and predictability in commercial transactions.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome: finding that Neptune's failure to supply crabs conforming to the norms and practices of the seafood trade constitutes a breach of contract. This decision would be justified because, as in HCCT 40/2014, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Fairness and Due Process:** Just as in HCCT 40/2014, addressing the key issue of conformity to trade norms ensures that both parties are treated fairly and that their expectations based on industry standards are met.
2. **Upholding Contractual and Trade Norms:** By recognizing the implied terms based on trade practices, the court would reinforce the importance of adhering to established norms, which is crucial for the predictability and stability of commercial transactions.
3. **Promoting Trust in the Legal System:** Ensuring that key issues are addressed and that trade practices are respected upholds the integrity of commercial transactions and promotes trust in the legal system, similar to the precedent case.
4. **Preventing Substantial Injustice:** As in HCCT 40/2014, failing to address a key issue like the conformity to trade norms would result in substantial injustice and unfairness to Wong Kee, who relied on these norms for its business operations.

Therefore, the court should find that Neptune's failure to supply crabs conforming to the norms and practices of the seafood trade constitutes a breach of contract, ensuring fairness, adherence to trade norms, and trust in the legal system.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the "Seller’s Liability" provision, that was not present in HCCT 40/2014. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of implied terms and trade practices. The "Seller’s Liability" provision in the current case explicitly excludes all liability for any loss or damage arising from any defect in any seafood product supplied, however caused. Due to this provision, applying the same outcome of finding a breach of contract in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the explicit terms agreed upon by the parties and potentially disregarding the principle of freedom of contract. Unlike in HCCT 40/2014, where the focus was on procedural fairness and addressing key issues, the presence of the "Seller’s Liability" provision in our case introduces a clear contractual term that limits Neptune's liability, which must be considered to avoid unjustly overriding the parties' agreed terms.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCCT 40/2014 should be stated as: "When both the failure to address key contractual obligations and implied terms based on trade practices (i*) and the presence of an explicit liability exclusion clause (m) are present, the court should decide that there has been no breach of contract (o)." Omitting the explicit liability exclusion clause (m) from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence (q) of undermining the explicit terms agreed upon by the parties and potentially disregarding the principle of freedom of contract. Indeed, the opinion in HCCT 40/2014 explicitly states that addressing key issues and ensuring fairness were crucial to their decision. However, in our current case, the explicit liability exclusion clause must be considered to avoid unjustly overriding the parties' agreed terms.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCCT 40/2014 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence (u) of procedural unfairness and denial of due process by ensuring that key issues are addressed. However, in our current case, there's no risk of procedural unfairness or denial of due process because the explicit liability exclusion clause was part of the agreed terms between Wong Kee and Neptune. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—ensuring procedural fairness and addressing key issues—is not relevant to our situation where the explicit terms of the contract must be respected.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the explicit liability exclusion clause (m), which was present in the precedent case HCCT 40/2014, requiring this factor for all similar cases of failure to address key contractual obligations and implied terms based on trade practices (i*) would lead to the undesirable consequence of undermining the principle of fairness and due process. Conversely, not requiring the explicit liability exclusion clause (m) would allow for the desirable outcome of ensuring that key issues are addressed and that trade practices are respected, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area. This approach promotes trust in commercial transactions and upholds the integrity of contractual agreements.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the explicit liability exclusion clause (m), which was present in HCCT 40/2014, we have the additional factor of the established norms and practices of the seafood trade (n). This factor (n), when considered alongside the shared circumstances of failure to address key contractual obligations and implied terms based on trade practices (i*), serves a similar function to the explicit liability exclusion clause (m) in the precedent case. Given the presence of the established norms and practices of the seafood trade (n), we submit that the reasoning in HCCT 40/2014 still applies, as the positive effects on fairness, due process, and adherence to trade norms would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCCT 40/2014, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the failure to address key contractual obligations and implied terms based on trade practices. However, it also differs significantly due to the presence of the explicit "Seller’s Liability" provision in the current case, which was not present in HCCT 40/2014.

The proposed legal rule from HCCT 40/2014, which emphasizes the importance of addressing key issues and ensuring fairness and due process, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the explicit liability exclusion clause in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the explicit liability exclusion clause should be respected to uphold the principle of freedom of contract (as argued in the rebuttal), and the counterpoint that fairness and adherence to trade norms are crucial for maintaining trust and predictability in commercial transactions (as argued in the surrebuttal).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, due process, and the importance of upholding contractual and trade norms, we conclude that Neptune's failure to supply crabs conforming to the norms and practices of the seafood trade does constitute a breach of contract. This decision is justified because:

1. **Ensuring Fairness and Due Process:** Addressing the key issue of conformity to trade norms ensures that both parties are treated fairly and that their expectations based on industry standards are met.
2. **Upholding Contractual and Trade Norms:** Recognizing the implied terms based on trade practices reinforces the importance of adhering to established norms, which is crucial for the predictability and stability of commercial transactions.
3. **Promoting Trust in the Legal System:** Ensuring that key issues are addressed and that trade practices are respected upholds the integrity of commercial transactions and promotes trust in the legal system.

However, the explicit "Seller’s Liability" provision must also be considered. While this clause limits Neptune's liability for defects, it does not necessarily absolve Neptune from the obligation to supply crabs that conform to the norms and practices of the seafood trade. The clause may limit the remedies available to Wong Kee but does not negate the breach itself.

Therefore, the court should find that Neptune's failure to supply crabs conforming to the norms and practices of the seafood trade constitutes a breach of contract, ensuring fairness, adherence to trade norms, and trust in the legal system, while also considering the limitations imposed by the "Seller’s Liability" provision. This balanced approach aligns with legal precedent and serves justice and legal consistency.

   - Wong Kee may reject the baby crabs.
   - If Wong Kee accepts the baby crabs, it must pay for them at the contract rate.
   - The course of dealing and usage of trade may influence the interpretation of this delivery.

### Conclusion:

Wong Kee's continued acceptance of crabs from Neptune after receiving the amended draft contract implies acceptance of the new terms, including the "composition" clause and the "Seller’s Liability" provision. However, the delivery of baby crabs instead of adult crabs constitutes a breach under Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 32 Subsection 1, allowing Wong Kee to reject the delivery. The course of dealing and usage of trade support Wong Kee's expectation of receiving adult crabs, and the "Seller’s Liability" provision may be subject to the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 71). Therefore, Wong Kee is entitled to reject the baby crabs and claim damages for the financial losses incurred.

## Deductive Reasoning: cfa

### Relevant law:

Shanghai Tongji Science & Technology Industrial Company Limited v Casil Clearing Limited

### Major Premise:

1. Shanghai Tongji Science & Technology Industrial Company Limited v Casil Clearing Limited

   Conditions:
   - The conduct of one party in causing a letter of credit (L/C) to be issued in favour of another party would be understood by a reasonable person standing in the latter's place as an offer to enter into a contract.
   - The conduct of the latter party in tendering documents and negotiating its draft under the L/C would be understood by a reasonable person in the former's position as an acceptance of such an offer.
   - The conduct is consistent only with there being a new contract implied, and inconsistent with there being no such contract.

   Consequences:
   - A legally binding contract may be inferred from the conduct of the parties.

   Exceptions:
   - The conduct relied upon is no more consistent with an intention to contract than with an intention not to contract.
   - The party seeking the implication of a contract actually knows that the other party does not intend to be bound by the terms alleged.

### Minor Premise:

1. Shanghai Tongji Science & Technology Industrial Company Limited v Casil Clearing Limited:

   - Wong Kee's conduct in continuing to place orders for crabs and accepting deliveries from Neptune after receiving the amended draft contract would be understood by a reasonable person in Neptune's position as an acceptance of the new terms proposed in the draft contract.
   - Neptune's conduct in continuing to supply crabs to Wong Kee under the same terms as before, except for the one instance of smaller crabs, would be understood by a reasonable person in Wong Kee's position as an acceptance of the new terms.
   - The conduct of both parties is consistent only with there being a new contract implied, and inconsistent with there being no such contract, as the transactions continued uninterrupted and in accordance with the terms of the amended draft contract.
   - The conduct relied upon (continued orders and deliveries) is more consistent with an intention to contract than with an intention not to contract.
   - There is no indication that Wong Kee actually knew that Neptune did not intend to be bound by the terms alleged.

### Conclusion:

A legally binding contract may be inferred from the conduct of Wong Kee and Neptune, implying acceptance of the new terms proposed in the amended draft contract.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (CHINACHEM FINANCIAL SERVICES LTD v. CENTURY VENTURE HOLDINGS LTD)

In the case of CHINACHEM FINANCIAL SERVICES LTD v. CENTURY VENTURE HOLDINGS LTD [2023] HKCFI 457; HCA 410/2013 (precedent p), the court ruled that the Agreement had prima facie expired on 25 February 2011, and there was no new contract implied by the parties' conduct after that date. The court found that the defendant's continued performance and the plaintiff's acceptance of services were consistent with the defendant hoping for an extension or renewal of the Agreement, rather than the existence of a new contract. The court also rejected the defendant's estoppel argument, holding that the conduct relied upon by the defendant did not amount to a representation that the plaintiff would not insist on the strict requirement of the written only modification clause.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in CHINACHEM FINANCIAL SERVICES LTD v. CENTURY VENTURE HOLDINGS LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Expiry of Agreement and Continuation of Performance**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In CHINACHEM, the Agreement had a clear expiry date, and the parties continued to perform after the expiry date without a new written agreement. Similarly, in our current case, the draft contract was not signed, but the parties continued their dealings as before.

- **Legal Concept 2: Written Modification Clause**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In CHINACHEM, the Agreement contained a written modification only clause, which required any changes to be in writing. In our current case, the amended draft contract also included a clause stating that no amendment or alteration of the terms shall be binding unless in writing and duly executed by the parties.

- **Legal Concept 3: Implied Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In CHINACHEM, the court considered whether the conduct of the parties implied a new contract. In our current case, the issue is whether Wong Kee's continued acceptance of crabs from Neptune after receiving the amended draft contract implies acceptance of the new terms.

- **Legal Concept 4: Estoppel**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In CHINACHEM, the defendant argued that the plaintiff was estopped from contending that the Agreement had expired. In our current case, a similar argument could be made regarding whether Wong Kee is estopped from denying the new terms proposed by Neptune.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (CHINACHEM FINANCIAL SERVICES LTD v. CENTURY VENTURE HOLDINGS LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of continued performance after the expiry of an agreement or after receiving an amended draft contract without signing it, the court should decide that no new contract is implied unless there is clear and unequivocal conduct indicating acceptance of the new terms. This rule was justified in CHINACHEM because the positive effects (E+) of requiring clear and unequivocal conduct to imply a new contract uphold the underlying values of contractual certainty and the enforceability of written modification clauses, which outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially leaving one party without a remedy for continued performance. 

In our current case, applying this rule would mean that Wong Kee's continued acceptance of crabs from Neptune after receiving the amended draft contract does not imply acceptance of the new terms, as there was no clear and unequivocal conduct indicating such acceptance. Therefore, Wong Kee is not bound by the new terms proposed by Neptune, and the original informal arrangement should be considered to have continued.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (CHINACHEM FINANCIAL SERVICES LTD v. CENTURY VENTURE HOLDINGS LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Expiry of Agreement and Continuation of Performance**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In CHINACHEM, the Agreement had a clear expiry date, and the parties continued to perform after the expiry date without a new written agreement. Similarly, in our current case, the draft contract was not signed, but the parties continued their dealings as before.

- **Legal Concept 2: Written Modification Clause**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In CHINACHEM, the Agreement contained a written modification only clause, which required any changes to be in writing. In our current case, the amended draft contract also included a clause stating that no amendment or alteration of the terms shall be binding unless in writing and duly executed by the parties.

- **Legal Concept 3: Implied Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In CHINACHEM, the court considered whether the conduct of the parties implied a new contract. In our current case, the issue is whether Wong Kee's continued acceptance of crabs from Neptune after receiving the amended draft contract implies acceptance of the new terms.

- **Legal Concept 4: Estoppel**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In CHINACHEM, the defendant argued that the plaintiff was estopped from contending that the Agreement had expired. In our current case, a similar argument could be made regarding whether Wong Kee is estopped from denying the new terms proposed by Neptune.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in CHINACHEM FINANCIAL SERVICES LTD v. CENTURY VENTURE HOLDINGS LTD. This decision would be justified because, as in CHINACHEM, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Contractual Certainty**: Requiring clear and unequivocal conduct to imply a new contract ensures that parties are aware of their obligations and rights, thereby reducing the risk of disputes and misunderstandings. This is particularly important in commercial contexts where large sums of money and business reputations are at stake.

2. **Enforcing Written Modification Clauses**: By adhering to the requirement that any changes to a contract must be in writing, the court reinforces the importance of formalities in contractual agreements. This protects the parties' original intentions and prevents one party from unilaterally altering the terms of the agreement without the other's explicit consent.

3. **Preventing Unjust Enrichment**: In the current case, Wong Kee continued to accept crabs from Neptune under the original informal arrangement. If the court were to imply acceptance of the new terms without clear and unequivocal conduct, it could result in Neptune being unjustly enriched at Wong Kee's expense, especially given the significant changes in the terms proposed by Neptune.

4. **Consistency in Legal Principles**: Applying the same rule as in CHINACHEM ensures consistency in the application of legal principles, which is a cornerstone of the common law system. This consistency provides predictability and stability in commercial transactions, encouraging businesses to engage in long-term relationships with confidence.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in CHINACHEM, it would uphold the underlying values of contractual certainty, enforceability of written modification clauses, prevention of unjust enrichment, and consistency in legal principles.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **CHINACHEM FINANCIAL SERVICES LTD v. CENTURY VENTURE HOLDINGS LTD**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of a **written modification only clause**. This clause was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as upholding contractual certainty and enforcing the agreed formalities, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided a clear and unequivocal standard for any modifications to the agreement. However, in our current case, this crucial **written modification only clause** is notably absent in the original informal arrangement between Wong Kee and Neptune. The dealings between Wong Kee and Neptune were conducted on a regular but informal basis without any formal written agreement or modification clause, which means that the same level of contractual certainty and enforceability of formalities is not present.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor **(the established trade norms and practices regarding the distribution of crab sizes)** that was not present in **CHINACHEM FINANCIAL SERVICES LTD v. CENTURY VENTURE HOLDINGS LTD**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the established trade norms and practices create an implicit understanding and expectation between the parties regarding the quality and size distribution of the crabs supplied. Due to these established trade norms, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as undermining the implicit trust and expectations in the seafood trade, than positive ones, unlike in **CHINACHEM FINANCIAL SERVICES LTD v. CENTURY VENTURE HOLDINGS LTD**. The presence of these trade norms means that Wong Kee had a reasonable expectation that the crabs supplied would conform to the usual size distribution, and Neptune's deviation from this expectation by supplying only baby mud crabs without prior notice or agreement significantly impacts the fairness and reasonableness of the dealings between the parties.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from **CHINACHEM FINANCIAL SERVICES LTD v. CENTURY VENTURE HOLDINGS LTD** should be stated as: "When both [the fact pattern of continued performance after the expiry of an agreement or after receiving an amended draft contract without signing it] and [the presence of a written modification only clause] are present, the court should decide that no new contract is implied unless there is clear and unequivocal conduct indicating acceptance of the new terms." Omitting [the presence of a written modification only clause] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of undermining the enforceability of informal agreements and established trade norms]. Indeed, the opinion in **CHINACHEM FINANCIAL SERVICES LTD v. CENTURY VENTURE HOLDINGS LTD** explicitly states that the written modification only clause was crucial to their decision, as it provided a clear standard for any modifications to the agreement.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in **CHINACHEM FINANCIAL SERVICES LTD v. CENTURY VENTURE HOLDINGS LTD** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties unilaterally altering the terms of an agreement without the other's explicit consent, thereby ensuring contractual certainty and enforceability of formalities]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [undermining the enforceability of informal agreements and established trade norms] occurring. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The established trade norms and practices regarding the distribution of crab sizes create an implicit understanding and expectation between the parties, which should be respected to maintain fairness and reasonableness in their dealings.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the written modification only clause, which was present in the precedent case CHINACHEM FINANCIAL SERVICES LTD v. CENTURY VENTURE HOLDINGS LTD, requiring this factor for all similar cases of continued performance after the expiry of an agreement or after receiving an amended draft contract without signing it would lead to the undesirable consequence of undermining the enforceability of informal agreements and established trade norms. Conversely, not requiring the written modification only clause would allow for the maintenance of implicit trust and expectations in the seafood trade, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and reasonableness in commercial dealings.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the written modification only clause, which was present in CHINACHEM FINANCIAL SERVICES LTD v. CENTURY VENTURE HOLDINGS LTD, we have the additional factor of established trade norms and practices regarding the distribution of crab sizes. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of continued performance and informal dealings, serves a similar function to the written modification only clause in the precedent case. Given the presence of established trade norms, we submit that the reasoning in CHINACHEM FINANCIAL SERVICES LTD v. CENTURY VENTURE HOLDINGS LTD still applies, as the positive effects on maintaining fairness, reasonableness, and implicit trust in commercial dealings would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **CHINACHEM FINANCIAL SERVICES LTD v. CENTURY VENTURE HOLDINGS LTD**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the fact pattern of continued performance after the expiry of an agreement or after receiving an amended draft contract without signing it, and the presence of a written modification clause in the proposed new agreement. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of a written modification only clause in the original informal arrangement and the established trade norms and practices regarding the distribution of crab sizes.

The proposed legal rule from **CHINACHEM FINANCIAL SERVICES LTD v. CENTURY VENTURE HOLDINGS LTD**—that no new contract is implied unless there is clear and unequivocal conduct indicating acceptance of the new terms—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the established trade norms in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the absence of a written modification only clause in the original arrangement and the established trade norms create an implicit understanding and expectation between the parties. This expectation should be respected to maintain fairness and reasonableness in their dealings.

Considering the underlying legal principles of contractual certainty, enforceability of formalities, and the importance of maintaining implicit trust and expectations in commercial dealings, we conclude that Wong Kee's continued acceptance of crabs from Neptune after receiving the amended draft contract does not imply acceptance of the new terms. The original informal arrangement should be considered to have continued, given the lack of clear and unequivocal conduct indicating acceptance of the new terms and the established trade norms that create an implicit understanding between the parties.

Therefore, Wong Kee is not bound by the new terms proposed by Neptune, and the original informal arrangement should be considered to have continued. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency, particularly in the context of established trade norms and practices in the seafood trade.

   - Where there is an available market for the goods in question, the measure of damages is prima facie to be ascertained by the difference between the contract price and the market or current price of the goods at the time or times when they ought to have been delivered, or, if no time was fixed for delivery, then at the time of the neglect or refusal to deliver.

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 53 Subsections 1-3:
- Neptune Company wrongfully delivered baby mud crabs instead of the adult crabs required by Wong Kee.
- Wong Kee has suffered financial loss as a result of being unable to use the baby crabs for its signature dish, leading to financial losses and angry reviews from customers.
- Wong Kee may maintain an action against Neptune for damages for non-delivery.
- The measure of damages would be the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting from Neptune's breach of contract, which includes the financial losses and damage to reputation due to the inability to serve the signature dish.

### Conclusion:

Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 53 Subsections 1-3 applies, and Wong Kee may maintain an action against Neptune for damages for non-delivery. The financial losses and angry reviews from customers are recoverable as consequential damages.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (Wing Tat Haberdashery Company Limited v Elegance Development & Industrial Co. Limited)
In the case of Wing Tat Haberdashery Company Limited v Elegance Development & Industrial Co. Limited (precedent p), the plaintiff claimed for the price of certain colour dyed tapes sold and delivered to the defendant. The defendant argued that a portion of the tapes did not conform to the sample. The court ruled that both parties were equally responsible for the consequences of the supply of defective goods. The judge calculated the plaintiff’s loss and damage based on the proportion of goods accepted by the defendant and allowed the defendant’s counterclaim in full, leading to a net judgment in favor of the defendant.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in Wing Tat Haberdashery Company Limited v Elegance Development & Industrial Co. Limited and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Breach of Warranty**: In both cases, the goods supplied did not conform to the expected quality or sample. In the precedent case, the colour dyed tapes had defects. In the current case, the crabs supplied were baby mud crabs instead of the usual mix of sizes.
- **Mitigation of Loss**: In both cases, the buyer had a duty to mitigate the loss. In the precedent case, the defendant was found to have not taken remedial steps upon discovering the defect. In the current case, Wong Kee accepted the baby crabs without taking steps to mitigate the loss.
- **Consequential Damages**: Both cases involve claims for consequential damages arising from the supply of defective goods. In the precedent case, the defendant claimed additional costs incurred due to the defective tapes. In the current case, Wong Kee claims financial losses and reputational damage due to the inability to serve its signature dish.
- **Apportionment of Liability**: In both cases, the court considered the apportionment of liability between the parties. In the precedent case, the judge apportioned the damages equally between the plaintiff and the defendant. In the current case, a similar consideration of apportionment may be relevant.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (Wing Tat Haberdashery Company Limited v Elegance Development & Industrial Co. Limited)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a breach of warranty leading to consequential damages, the court should consider the apportionment of liability and the duty to mitigate loss. This rule was justified in Wing Tat Haberdashery Company Limited v Elegance Development & Industrial Co. Limited because the court found that both parties had a role in the resulting damages and that the buyer had a duty to take reasonable steps to mitigate the loss. The positive effects (E+) of this outcome include promoting fairness and encouraging parties to act reasonably upon discovering defects, while the negative effects (E-) are minimal as it prevents unjust enrichment and ensures that damages are proportionate to the parties' respective responsibilities.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (Wing Tat Haberdashery Company Limited v Elegance Development & Industrial Co. Limited) are present:

- **Breach of Warranty**: In both cases, the goods supplied did not conform to the expected quality or sample. In the precedent case, the colour dyed tapes had defects. In the current case, the crabs supplied were baby mud crabs instead of the usual mix of sizes.
- **Mitigation of Loss**: In both cases, the buyer had a duty to mitigate the loss. In the precedent case, the defendant was found to have not taken remedial steps upon discovering the defect. In the current case, Wong Kee accepted the baby crabs without taking steps to mitigate the loss.
- **Consequential Damages**: Both cases involve claims for consequential damages arising from the supply of defective goods. In the precedent case, the defendant claimed additional costs incurred due to the defective tapes. In the current case, Wong Kee claims financial losses and reputational damage due to the inability to serve its signature dish.
- **Apportionment of Liability**: In both cases, the court considered the apportionment of liability between the parties. In the precedent case, the judge apportioned the damages equally between the plaintiff and the defendant. In the current case, a similar consideration of apportionment may be relevant.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach a similar outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in Wing Tat Haberdashery Company Limited v Elegance Development & Industrial Co. Limited, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Promoting Fairness**: Apportioning liability between Wong Kee and Neptune would ensure that both parties bear responsibility for their respective roles in the resulting damages. This promotes fairness and prevents one party from being unduly burdened by the consequences of the breach.

2. **Encouraging Reasonable Conduct**: By recognizing the duty to mitigate loss, the court would encourage parties to take reasonable steps upon discovering defects. This would prevent unnecessary escalation of damages and promote efficient resolution of issues.

3. **Proportional Damages**: Ensuring that damages are proportionate to the parties' respective responsibilities would prevent unjust enrichment and ensure that compensation is fair and reasonable.

4. **Consistency in Legal Principles**: Applying the same legal principles and rules as established in the precedent case would ensure consistency and predictability in the application of the law, which is a fundamental principle of the common law system.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in Wing Tat Haberdashery Company Limited v Elegance Development & Industrial Co. Limited, it would have the positive effects of promoting fairness, encouraging reasonable conduct, ensuring proportional damages, and maintaining consistency in legal principles.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case Wing Tat Haberdashery Company Limited v Elegance Development & Industrial Co. Limited, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of a formal contract that outlined specific terms and conditions, including the quality and conformity of the goods supplied. This formal contract was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as promoting fairness and encouraging reasonable conduct, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided a clear basis for determining the parties' obligations and responsibilities. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of a formal, signed contract is notably absent as the agreement between Wong Kee and Neptune was never formally executed, despite the draft contract being sent and the parties continuing their transactions based on prior informal arrangements.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the "Seller’s Liability" clause, that was not present in Wing Tat Haberdashery Company Limited v Elegance Development & Industrial Co. Limited. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the "Seller’s Liability" clause explicitly excludes Neptune's liability for any loss or damage arising from any defect in the seafood products supplied. Due to this clause, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the contractual freedom and the express terms agreed upon by the parties, unlike in Wing Tat Haberdashery Company Limited v Elegance Development & Industrial Co. Limited because there was no such exclusion of liability in the precedent case. This clause shifts the balance of responsibility and significantly impacts the assessment of consequential damages and the duty to mitigate loss.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from Wing Tat Haberdashery Company Limited v Elegance Development & Industrial Co. Limited should be stated as: "When both a breach of warranty leading to consequential damages and the presence of a formal, signed contract are present, the court should apportion liability and consider the duty to mitigate loss." Omitting the presence of a formal, signed contract from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of undermining the contractual freedom and the express terms agreed upon by the parties. Indeed, the opinion in Wing Tat Haberdashery Company Limited v Elegance Development & Industrial Co. Limited implicitly relied on the formal contract to determine the parties' obligations and responsibilities, which was crucial to their decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in Wing Tat Haberdashery Company Limited v Elegance Development & Industrial Co. Limited was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of unfairly burdening one party with the entire responsibility for consequential damages when both parties had a role in the resulting damages. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because the "Seller’s Liability" clause explicitly excludes Neptune's liability for any loss or damage arising from any defect in the seafood products supplied. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The presence of the "Seller’s Liability" clause shifts the balance of responsibility and significantly impacts the assessment of consequential damages and the duty to mitigate loss, making the precedent's rule inapplicable.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the formal, signed contract, which was present in the precedent case Wing Tat Haberdashery Company Limited v Elegance Development & Industrial Co. Limited, requiring this factor for all similar cases of breach of warranty leading to consequential damages would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would undermine the practical realities of business operations where parties often rely on established practices and informal agreements. Conversely, not requiring a formal, signed contract would allow for the recognition of the parties' established course of dealings and the reasonable expectations arising from such dealings. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which include the enforcement of reasonable expectations and the promotion of fairness in commercial transactions.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the formal, signed contract, which was present in Wing Tat Haberdashery Company Limited v Elegance Development & Industrial Co. Limited, we have the additional factor of the "Seller’s Liability" clause. This "Seller’s Liability" clause, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of breach of warranty and consequential damages, serves a similar function to the formal contract in the precedent case by explicitly defining the scope of liability and the parties' responsibilities. Given the presence of the "Seller’s Liability" clause, we submit that the reasoning in Wing Tat Haberdashery Company Limited v Elegance Development & Industrial Co. Limited still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as promoting fairness, encouraging reasonable conduct, and ensuring proportional damages would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to Wing Tat Haberdashery Company Limited v Elegance Development & Industrial Co. Limited, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the breach of warranty, the duty to mitigate loss, and the claim for consequential damages. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of a formal, signed contract and the presence of a "Seller’s Liability" clause in the current case.

The proposed legal rule of apportioning liability and considering the duty to mitigate loss finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of the formal contract in the precedent case and the impact of the "Seller’s Liability" clause in the current case.

Considering the underlying legal principles of promoting fairness, encouraging reasonable conduct, ensuring proportional damages, and maintaining consistency in legal principles, we conclude that the financial losses and angry reviews from customers are not fully recoverable as consequential damages in the current case. The "Seller’s Liability" clause explicitly excludes Neptune's liability for any loss or damage arising from any defect in the seafood products supplied, which significantly impacts the assessment of consequential damages.

Therefore, while Wong Kee may have a claim for some damages, the extent of recoverable damages should be limited by the "Seller’s Liability" clause. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by respecting the express terms agreed upon by the parties.

In conclusion, Wong Kee's financial losses and reputational damage due to the inability to serve its signature dish are not fully recoverable as consequential damages, given the presence of the "Seller’s Liability" clause. The court should apportion liability in a manner that respects this clause and considers the duty to mitigate loss, ensuring that damages are proportionate to the parties' respective responsibilities.
