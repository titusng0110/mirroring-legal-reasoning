### Legal Analysis of the Scenario

#### 1. Identification of Legal Issues

The scenario presents several legal issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Formation of Contract**: Whether a binding contract was formed between Wong Kee and Neptune despite the absence of a signed agreement.
2. **Implied Terms**: Whether there are any implied terms in the contract regarding the size and quality of the crabs.
3. **Minimum Quantity Clause**: The enforceability of the minimum quantity clause added by Neptune.
4. **Composition Clause**: The validity and reasonableness of the clause giving Neptune absolute discretion over the size of crabs supplied.
5. **Exclusion of Liability**: The enforceability of the exclusion clause that Neptune added to the contract.
6. **Remedies for Breach**: The remedies available to Wong Kee for Neptune's failure to supply crabs of the expected size.

#### 2. Applicable Laws

The following laws and legal principles are applicable to the scenario:

1. **Contract Formation**: Common law principles of contract formation, including offer, acceptance, and consideration.
2. **Implied Terms**: Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance (Cap. 457) and case law on implied terms in contracts.
3. **Minimum Quantity Clause**: Case law on the enforceability of minimum quantity clauses in contracts.
4. **Composition Clause**: Principles of reasonableness and fairness in contract terms.
5. **Exclusion of Liability**: Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 71) and relevant case law.
6. **Remedies for Breach**: Sale of Goods Ordinance (Cap. 26) and common law remedies for breach of contract.

#### 3. Application of Law to Facts

**Contract Formation**

Despite the absence of a signed agreement, the continuous dealings between Wong Kee and Neptune from June 2013 to November 2020 indicate a course of conduct that suggests a binding contract. The fact that Wong Kee continued to place orders and Neptune continued to supply crabs as per the draft agreement terms implies acceptance of those terms by conduct.

**Implied Terms**

Given the long-standing relationship and the established norms in the seafood trade, it is likely that certain terms can be implied into the contract. According to the Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance (Cap. 457), there is an implied term that the supplier will carry out the service with reasonable care and skill. Additionally, the consistent practice of supplying a mix of sizes conforming to industry norms could imply a term that the crabs supplied should meet these standards.

**Minimum Quantity Clause**

The minimum quantity clause requiring Wong Kee to order at least 1000 kilograms per week is likely enforceable. In **Safe Steel Furniture Factory Limited v. Lamex Trading Company Limited [1999] HKCFI 1513**, the court held that minimum quantity clauses are enforceable if they are clear and agreed upon by both parties. Since Wong Kee accepted the amended terms, this clause is likely binding.

**Composition Clause**

The clause giving Neptune absolute discretion over the size of crabs supplied is problematic. In **On Your Mart Co Limited v. Cosway (HK) Limited [2015] HKCFI 2062**, the court emphasized that terms must be reasonable and not give one party unfettered discretion. The clause could be challenged as unreasonable, especially given the established practice of supplying a mix of sizes.

**Exclusion of Liability**

The exclusion clause added by Neptune is subject to the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 71). According to **Lee Yuk Shing v. Dianoor International Limited [2015] HKCFI 1129**, exclusion clauses must be clear and unambiguous. Additionally, they must pass the reasonableness test under the Ordinance. Given the significant impact on Wong Kee's business, the clause may be deemed unreasonable and thus unenforceable.

**Remedies for Breach**

Under the Sale of Goods Ordinance (Cap. 26), Wong Kee may have several remedies for Neptune's breach of contract:

1. **Damages for Non-Delivery**: Section 53 allows Wong Kee to claim damages for Neptune's failure to deliver crabs of the expected size.
2. **Damages for Breach of Warranty**: Section 55 provides that Wong Kee can claim damages for the breach of an implied warranty regarding the quality and size of the crabs.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, Wong Kee has a strong case against Neptune for breach of contract. The continuous dealings and acceptance of the amended terms by conduct suggest a binding contract. The implied terms regarding the size and quality of crabs, the enforceability of the minimum quantity clause, and the potential unreasonableness of the composition and exclusion clauses all support Wong Kee's position. Wong Kee can seek remedies under the Sale of Goods Ordinance for Neptune's failure to supply crabs of the expected size, resulting in financial losses and reputational damage.
