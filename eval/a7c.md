### Legal Analysis of the Scenario

#### 1. Identification of Legal Issues

The scenario presents several legal issues:

1. **Formation of Contract**: Whether a binding contract was formed between Wong Kee and Neptune despite the absence of a signed agreement.
2. **Terms of the Contract**: If a contract was formed, what are the terms of the contract, particularly regarding the size composition of the crabs and the exclusion of liability.
3. **Breach of Contract**: Whether Neptune breached the contract by delivering only baby mud crabs.
4. **Exclusion of Liability**: Whether Neptune can rely on the exclusion clause to avoid liability for the losses suffered by Wong Kee.

#### 2. Applicable Laws

The applicable laws include:

1. **Contract Law**: Principles of offer, acceptance, consideration, and intention to create legal relations.
2. **Sale of Goods Ordinance (Cap. 26)**: Provisions related to the sale of goods, including implied terms about quality and fitness for purpose.
3. **Common Law Principles**: Case law on the interpretation of exclusion clauses and the incorporation of terms into contracts.

#### 3. Application of Law to Facts

**Formation of Contract**

- **Offer and Acceptance**: Wong Kee sent a draft contract to Neptune, which Neptune amended and returned. Wong Kee's acceptance of these amendments, despite not signing the contract, can be inferred from the continued transactions under the new terms.
- **Consideration**: The mutual promises to supply and purchase crabs constitute consideration.
- **Intention to Create Legal Relations**: The formalization of the arrangement and the continued business dealings indicate an intention to create legal relations.

**Terms of the Contract**

- **Express Terms**: The terms proposed by Neptune, including the "minimum quantity" clause, "composition" clause, and "Sellerâ€™s Liability" provision, are likely to be considered part of the contract due to Wong Kee's acceptance and the subsequent conduct of the parties.
- **Implied Terms**: Under the Sale of Goods Ordinance, there are implied terms that goods must be of satisfactory quality and fit for the purpose for which they are bought (Sections 16 and 17).

**Breach of Contract**

- **Composition Clause**: Neptune reserved the "absolute discretion to determine the size of mud crabs supplied." However, this discretion must be exercised reasonably and in good faith. Delivering only baby crabs, which are unsuitable for Wong Kee's signature dish, may be seen as unreasonable and a breach of the implied term of fitness for purpose.
- **Previous Course of Dealings**: The consistent delivery of a mix of sizes in conformity with trade norms may imply a term that the crabs should meet these standards. The sudden deviation to only baby crabs could be a breach of this implied term.

**Exclusion of Liability**

- **Interpretation of Exclusion Clauses**: Courts generally interpret exclusion clauses strictly against the party seeking to rely on them (contra proferentem rule). The clause excluding liability for "any defect in any seafood product supplied" may not cover a situation where the entire delivery is unsuitable for the intended purpose.
- **Reasonableness Test**: Under common law principles and potentially the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 71), exclusion clauses must be reasonable. Given the significant deviation from the expected quality and the impact on Wong Kee's business, the exclusion clause may be deemed unreasonable and thus unenforceable.

#### 4. Conclusion

Based on the analysis:

1. A binding contract likely exists between Wong Kee and Neptune, incorporating the terms proposed by Neptune.
2. Neptune's delivery of only baby crabs likely constitutes a breach of the implied term of fitness for purpose and possibly the express terms regarding composition.
3. The exclusion clause may not protect Neptune from liability due to its potential unreasonableness and the strict interpretation against Neptune.

Wong Kee may have a strong case for claiming damages for the financial losses and reputational harm suffered due to Neptune's breach of contract.
