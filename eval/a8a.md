### Legal Analysis of the Scenario

#### 1. Identification of Legal Issues

The primary legal issues in this scenario are:
1. **Breach of Contract**: Whether Tony's actions constitute a breach of the contract with Nick.
2. **Misrepresentation**: Whether Tony's assurances about the sourcing and finishes of the wood amount to misrepresentation.
3. **Remedies**: What remedies are available to Nick, including the possibility of terminating the contract and recovering damages.

#### 2. Applicable Laws

The relevant areas of law include:
1. **Contract Law**: Specifically, the terms of the contract, implied terms, and breach of contract.
2. **Misrepresentation**: The principles governing misrepresentation in contract law.
3. **Remedies**: The legal remedies available for breach of contract and misrepresentation.

#### 3. Application of Law to Facts

##### Breach of Contract

**Express Terms**: The written agreement specifies the delivery dates, amounts, price, and wood type but is silent on the sourcing and paint/varnish requirements. 

**Implied Terms**: Given the discussions between Nick and Tony, it could be argued that there was an implied term in the contract that the wood would be locally sourced and that plant-based paints and varnishes would be used. In Hong Kong law, as in English law, terms can be implied into a contract based on the intentions of the parties, the necessity for business efficacy, or by custom.

**Case Law**: In *The Moorcock* (1889) 14 PD 64, the court held that terms can be implied into a contract to give it business efficacy. Similarly, in *Shirlaw v Southern Foundries (1926) Ltd* [1939] 2 KB 206, the "officious bystander" test was established, where a term can be implied if it is so obvious that it goes without saying.

**Application**: Given Nick's explicit emphasis on the importance of locally sourced wood and plant-based finishes, it is likely that these terms could be implied into the contract. Tony's failure to comply with these implied terms would constitute a breach of contract.

##### Misrepresentation

**Definition**: A misrepresentation is a false statement of fact made by one party to another, which induces the other party to enter into the contract.

**Types**: Misrepresentation can be fraudulent, negligent, or innocent.

**Case Law**: In *Derry v Peek* (1889) 14 App Cas 337, the House of Lords defined fraudulent misrepresentation. In *Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd* [1964] AC 465, the concept of negligent misrepresentation was established.

**Application**: Tony's assurances about the sourcing and finishes of the wood could be considered misrepresentations. If Tony knew these statements were false or made them recklessly, it would be fraudulent misrepresentation. If Tony made these statements carelessly, it would be negligent misrepresentation. Even if Tony believed the statements to be true, it could still be an innocent misrepresentation.

##### Remedies

**Termination**: For a breach of a condition or a serious breach of an innominate term, Nick would be entitled to terminate the contract. Given the importance of the sourcing and finishes to Nick's business, these terms could be considered conditions.

**Damages**: Nick would be entitled to damages for any losses suffered as a result of the breach. This could include the cost of replacing the non-compliant wood and finishes, any loss of business or reputation, and any other consequential losses.

**Case Law**: In *Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd* [1962] 2 QB 26, the court held that for an innominate term, the right to terminate depends on whether the breach deprives the innocent party of substantially the whole benefit of the contract.

**Application**: Given the fundamental importance of the sourcing and finishes to Nick's business, it is likely that the breach would be considered serious enough to justify termination. Nick would also be entitled to recover damages for any losses suffered.

### Conclusion

Nick has strong grounds to terminate the contract with Tony and seek damages. Tony's actions likely constitute a breach of implied terms regarding the sourcing and finishes of the wood. Additionally, Tony's assurances could amount to misrepresentation. Nick should be able to terminate the contract and recover damages for any losses suffered as a result of Tony's breach and misrepresentation.
