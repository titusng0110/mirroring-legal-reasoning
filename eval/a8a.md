### Legal Analysis of the Scenario

#### 1. Identification of Legal Issues

1. **Breach of Contract**: Whether Knock-Out and Copy Dog have valid grounds to consider themselves discharged from their contracts with Real Plastic.
2. **Modification of Contract**: The effect of the agreed changes in delivery dates and discounts on the original contracts.
3. **Frustration of Contract**: Whether the drastic change in market demand for synthetic crocodile leather constitutes frustration of the contracts.
4. **Remedies for Breach**: The remedies available to Real Plastic if Knock-Out and Copy Dog are found to be in breach of their contractual obligations.

#### 2. Applicable Laws

1. **Contract Law**: The principles of contract formation, performance, breach, and remedies under Hong Kong law, which is based on common law principles.
2. **Doctrine of Frustration**: The legal doctrine that discharges parties from their contractual obligations when an unforeseen event renders the contract impossible to perform or radically changes the nature of the contractual obligations.
3. **Modification of Contracts**: The legal requirements for a valid modification of a contract, including consideration and mutual agreement.

#### 3. Application of Law to Facts

**Breach of Contract**

- **Original Contracts**: Both Knock-Out and Copy Dog had contracts with Real Plastic for delivery on 12 April, with time being of the essence.
- **Modification**: Knock-Out agreed to a new delivery date of 19 April with a 10% discount. This constitutes a valid modification of the original contract, supported by consideration (the discount).
- **Clerical Error**: The clerical error recording the new delivery date as 9 April does not affect the validity of the agreed modification to 19 April, as the intention of the parties was clear.

**Frustration of Contract**

- **Change in Market Demand**: The collapse in consumer demand for synthetic crocodile leather due to the popularity of leopard prints does not constitute frustration. Frustration requires an unforeseen event that makes performance impossible or radically different, not merely unprofitable or less desirable (Davis Contractors Ltd v Fareham UDC [1956] AC 696).
- **Performance Still Possible**: Real Plastic can still deliver the synthetic leather, and the contracts are not rendered impossible or radically different by the change in market conditions.

**Remedies for Breach**

- **Knock-Out**: Knock-Out's refusal to accept delivery on 19 April constitutes a breach of the modified contract. Real Plastic can claim damages for breach of contract, including the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of breach, as well as any additional costs incurred.
- **Copy Dog**: Copy Dog's refusal to accept delivery on 12 April constitutes a breach of the original contract. Real Plastic can similarly claim damages for breach of contract.

**Damages**

- **Expectation Damages**: Real Plastic is entitled to expectation damages, which aim to put the injured party in the position they would have been in had the contract been performed. This includes the difference between the contract price ($20 per meter) and the market price at the time of breach ($12 per meter), multiplied by the quantity (200,000 meters for each contract).
- **Reliance Damages**: Real Plastic may also claim reliance damages for the $5 million spent preparing to perform the contracts, provided these expenses were reasonably incurred in reliance on the contracts.

#### Conclusion

Knock-Out and Copy Dog do not have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations. The change in market demand does not constitute frustration, and both parties are in breach of their respective contracts. Real Plastic is entitled to claim damages for these breaches, including expectation and reliance damages.
