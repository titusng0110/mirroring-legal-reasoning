# Contract Law: Whether the power surge at Real Plastic's plant constitutes a force majeure event

## Deductive Reasoning: cfa

### Relevant law:

Goldlion Properties Limited v Regent National Enterprises Limited

### Major Premise:

1. Goldlion Properties Limited v Regent National Enterprises Limited

   Conditions:
   - A force majeure clause is present in the contract.
   - The occurrence of a matter since the agreement for sale and purchase.
   - Which matter was beyond the reasonable control of the vendor.
   - Had caused the vendor to form the opinion.
   - Which opinion was reasonable.
   - That the matter constituted a material hindrance to completion.

   Consequences:
   - The vendor may invoke the force majeure clause to justify its failure to complete the sale.

   Exceptions:
   - The vendor did not take all reasonable steps to avoid its operation or mitigate its results.
   - The opinion formed by the vendor was not reasonable.
   - The vendor did not act in good faith.

### Minor Premise:

1. Goldlion Properties Limited v Regent National Enterprises Limited:

   - A force majeure clause is present in the contract between Knock-Out and Real Plastic, and between Copy Dog and Real Plastic.
   - The power surge at Real Plastic's plant occurred after the agreement for sale and purchase.
   - The power surge was beyond the reasonable control of Real Plastic.
   - The power surge caused Real Plastic to form the opinion that it could not fulfill both orders on time.
   - Real Plastic's opinion was reasonable given the circumstances.
   - The power surge constituted a material hindrance to completion of both orders on time.

   Exceptions:
   - Real Plastic took reasonable steps to mitigate the results by offering discounts and alternative delivery dates.
   - The opinion formed by Real Plastic was reasonable.
   - Real Plastic acted in good faith by promptly informing both Knock-Out and Copy Dog and offering solutions.

### Conclusion:

The power surge at Real Plastic's plant constitutes a force majeure event under the conditions set forth in Goldlion Properties Limited v Regent National Enterprises Limited. Therefore, Real Plastic may invoke the force majeure clause to justify its failure to complete the sale on the original terms.

### Remedies:

Since Knock-Out and Copy Dog do not have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations, Real Plastic may seek the following remedies:

1. **Specific Performance**: Real Plastic could seek a court order requiring Knock-Out and Copy Dog to perform their contractual obligations, although this is less likely given the nature of the goods and the changed market conditions.

2. **Damages**: Real Plastic can claim damages for breach of contract. The damages would likely include the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of breach, as well as any additional costs incurred in preparing to perform the contracts.

3. **Mitigation**: Real Plastic should also consider any steps it can take to mitigate its losses, such as finding alternative buyers for the synthetic leather at the current market price.

In summary, Real Plastic has a strong case for invoking the force majeure clause and may pursue damages for breach of contract against Knock-Out and Copy Dog.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI v RICH PROSPER LIMITED)
In the case of HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI (張潔麗) 1st Plaintiff PAU WAI LAM (鮑惠林) 2nd Plaintiff And RICH PROSPER LIMITED (榮殷財務有限公司) 1st Defendant YEUNG TING CHEUNG (楊丁祥) 2nd Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the 1st Defendant could not rely on an implied condition precedent to excuse its failure to perform the contract. The court emphasized that the terms of the contract were clear and unambiguous, and the 1st Defendant had failed to exercise due diligence. The court also held that the doctrine of frustration did not apply because the delay caused by the DLO, although extraordinary, did not render the contract impossible to perform but merely more onerous.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Implied Terms and Conditions Precedent**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the defendants attempted to argue that certain conditions should be implied into the contract to excuse their non-performance. In HCA 972/2011, the 1st Defendant argued for an implied condition precedent regarding the DLO's assessment of the premium. In the current case, Real Plastic might argue that the power surge constitutes a force majeure event excusing their non-performance.
- **Legal Concept 2: Doctrine of Frustration**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: Both cases involve the invocation of the doctrine of frustration due to unforeseen events. In HCA 972/2011, the 1st Defendant argued that the delay by the DLO frustrated the contract. In the current case, Real Plastic might argue that the power surge frustrated the contract.
- **Legal Concept 3: Business Risk and Due Diligence**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In both cases, the court examined whether the parties had exercised due diligence and whether the unforeseen event was a business risk that should have been anticipated. In HCA 972/2011, the court found that the 1st Defendant failed to exercise due diligence. In the current case, the court will likely consider whether Real Plastic should have anticipated the risk of a power surge.
- **Legal Concept 4: Performance and Financial Consequences**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: Both cases involve the financial consequences of non-performance. In HCA 972/2011, the court considered the financial impact of the increased premium and delay. In the current case, the court will consider the financial impact of the delayed delivery and the subsequent market price drop.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of an unforeseen event causing delay or increased difficulty in performance, the court should decide that the contract is not frustrated and that implied conditions precedent should not be read into the contract to excuse non-performance. This rule was justified in HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI because the positive effects (E+) of enforcing the clear and unambiguous terms of the contract and holding parties accountable for their business risks and due diligence outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially harsh financial consequences for the non-performing party. The court's decision promotes certainty in contractual relationships and encourages parties to explicitly address potential risks in their agreements.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Implied Terms and Conditions Precedent**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the defendants attempted to argue that certain conditions should be implied into the contract to excuse their non-performance. In HCA 972/2011, the 1st Defendant argued for an implied condition precedent regarding the DLO's assessment of the premium. In the current case, Real Plastic might argue that the power surge constitutes a force majeure event excusing their non-performance.

- **Legal Concept 2: Doctrine of Frustration**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: Both cases involve the invocation of the doctrine of frustration due to unforeseen events. In HCA 972/2011, the 1st Defendant argued that the delay by the DLO frustrated the contract. In the current case, Real Plastic might argue that the power surge frustrated the contract.

- **Legal Concept 3: Business Risk and Due Diligence**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In both cases, the court examined whether the parties had exercised due diligence and whether the unforeseen event was a business risk that should have been anticipated. In HCA 972/2011, the court found that the 1st Defendant failed to exercise due diligence. In the current case, the court will likely consider whether Real Plastic should have anticipated the risk of a power surge.

- **Legal Concept 4: Performance and Financial Consequences**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: Both cases involve the financial consequences of non-performance. In HCA 972/2011, the court considered the financial impact of the increased premium and delay. In the current case, the court will consider the financial impact of the delayed delivery and the subsequent market price drop.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Enforcing Clear and Unambiguous Terms**: Just as in HCA 972/2011, enforcing the clear and unambiguous terms of the contract between Real Plastic and Knock-Out/Copy Dog promotes certainty in contractual relationships. It ensures that parties are held accountable for the terms they agreed upon, thereby fostering a stable and predictable business environment.

2. **Encouraging Due Diligence**: By not allowing Real Plastic to rely on an implied condition precedent or the doctrine of frustration, the court would encourage businesses to exercise due diligence and to explicitly address potential risks in their contracts. This would lead to more thorough and careful contract drafting, reducing the likelihood of disputes.

3. **Allocating Business Risks Appropriately**: The court's decision in HCA 972/2011 emphasized that unforeseen events causing delay or increased difficulty in performance are ordinary business risks. Applying the same rule here would reinforce the principle that businesses must anticipate and manage such risks, rather than seeking to shift the burden to the other party or the court.

4. **Promoting Fairness and Justice**: While the financial consequences for Real Plastic may be severe, the court's role is to enforce the contract as agreed by the parties, not to rewrite it to achieve a more favorable outcome for one party. This approach ensures that the law is applied consistently and fairly, upholding the integrity of contractual agreements.

Therefore, Real Plastic should not be excused from its contractual obligations due to the power surge, and Knock-Out and Copy Dog do not have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations. Real Plastic may seek remedies for breach of contract, including damages for any losses incurred due to the non-performance by Knock-Out and Copy Dog.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the delay caused by the DLO, although extraordinary, did not render the contract impossible to perform but merely more onerous. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of enforcing the clear and unambiguous terms of the contract outweighed any potential drawbacks because it promoted certainty in contractual relationships and encouraged parties to explicitly address potential risks in their agreements. However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as the power surge at Real Plastic's plant has rendered it impossible for Real Plastic to fulfill both orders on time, which is a different scenario from merely making performance more onerous.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—the clerical error that recorded the new date of delivery as 9 April—that was not present in HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces an element of ambiguity and potential miscommunication regarding the agreed delivery date. Due to this clerical error, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as increased uncertainty and potential unfairness to Knock-Out, who might have relied on the erroneous date, than positive ones. Unlike in HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI, where the terms were clear and unambiguous, the presence of this clerical error complicates the determination of the parties' obligations and expectations, thereby making it inappropriate to apply the same strict enforcement of the contract terms.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI should be stated as "When both the fact pattern of an unforeseen event causing delay or increased difficulty in performance and the absence of a clerical error or ambiguity in the contract terms are present, the court should decide that the contract is not frustrated and that implied conditions precedent should not be read into the contract to excuse non-performance." Omitting the clerical error or ambiguity from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of enforcing contract terms that are not clear and unambiguous, thereby increasing uncertainty and potential unfairness to the parties involved. Indeed, the opinion in HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI explicitly states that the terms of the Agreement were comprehensive, unambiguous, and not unreasonable, which was crucial to their decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of parties escaping their contractual obligations due to ordinary business risks and to promote certainty in contractual relationships. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because the clerical error introduces an element of ambiguity regarding the agreed delivery date. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—to enforce clear and unambiguous contract terms—is not relevant to our situation where the contract terms are ambiguous due to the clerical error.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of the delay caused by the DLO, which was present in the precedent case HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI, requiring this factor for all similar cases of unforeseen events causing delay or increased difficulty in performance would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would mean that any unforeseen event that renders performance impossible, rather than merely more onerous, would automatically excuse non-performance, thereby undermining the principle of holding parties accountable for their contractual obligations. Conversely, not requiring the factor of delay caused by a third party would allow for a more nuanced approach that considers the specific circumstances of each case, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, such as fairness, certainty, and the allocation of business risks.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of the delay caused by the DLO, which was present in HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI, we have the additional factor of the clerical error that recorded the new date of delivery as 9 April. This clerical error, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of an unforeseen event causing delay or increased difficulty in performance, serves a similar function to the delay caused by the DLO in the precedent case. Given the presence of the clerical error, we submit that the reasoning in HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as fairness, certainty, and the encouragement of due diligence would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. The clerical error introduces an element of ambiguity that necessitates a careful examination of the parties' intentions and expectations, thereby justifying the same outcome as the precedent.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI v RICH PROSPER LIMITED, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the invocation of the doctrine of frustration due to unforeseen events and the examination of whether the parties exercised due diligence. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the clerical error that recorded the new date of delivery as 9 April and the fact that the unforeseen event (power surge) rendered performance impossible rather than merely more onerous.

The proposed legal rule from HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI, which emphasizes enforcing clear and unambiguous contract terms and holding parties accountable for their business risks, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the clerical error and the impossibility of performance due to the power surge.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that enforcing clear contract terms promotes certainty and encourages due diligence (as argued in the initial analogy) and the counterargument that the clerical error introduces ambiguity, making strict enforcement potentially unfair (as raised in the rebuttal).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, certainty, and the allocation of business risks, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Real Plastic should not be excused from its contractual obligations due to the power surge. Knock-Out and Copy Dog do not have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations. The clerical error, while introducing some ambiguity, does not fundamentally alter the nature of the contract or the obligations of the parties.

Therefore, Real Plastic may seek remedies for breach of contract, including damages for any losses incurred due to the non-performance by Knock-Out and Copy Dog. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by upholding the principle that parties must anticipate and manage business risks and explicitly address potential issues in their contracts.

## Deductive Reasoning: cfi

### Relevant law:

Hua Yang Printing Holdings Co. Ltd v Pure Health Publishing Co. Europe B.V.

### Major Premise:

1. Hua Yang Printing Holdings Co. Ltd v Pure Health Publishing Co. Europe B.V.

   Conditions:
   - The contract stipulates that time is of the essence; and
   - The stipulated time for performance must be exactly complied with; or
   - The circumstances of the contract or the nature of the subject-matter indicate that the fixed date must be exactly complied with; or
   - One party has been guilty of undue delay and the other party gives notice requiring the contract to be performed within a reasonable time

   Consequences:
   - Time is of the essence of the contract; and
   - Failure to perform the obligation within the stipulated time constitutes a breach of contract

   Exceptions:
   - The parties have waived the right to insist on the original time for performance; or
   - The parties have agreed to a new time for performance

### Minor Premise:

1. The contract between Knock-Out and Real Plastic stipulated that time was of the essence.
2. The contract between Copy Dog and Real Plastic also stipulated that time was of the essence.
3. Real Plastic informed both Knock-Out and Copy Dog on 15 March that it would not be able to fulfil its contractual undertakings by 12 April.
4. Knock-Out agreed to a new delivery date of 19 April in exchange for a 10% discount, thereby waiving the right to insist on the original time for performance.
5. Copy Dog did not agree to a new delivery date and insisted on the original delivery date of 12 April.
6. Real Plastic failed to deliver the synthetic leather to Copy Dog by 12 April, constituting a breach of contract as time was of the essence and no new time for performance was agreed upon.

### Conclusion:

1. Knock-Out does not have a valid excuse for refusing to perform its contractual obligations as it agreed to a new delivery date of 19 April. Real Plastic should deliver the synthetic leather to Knock-Out by 19 April as agreed.
2. Copy Dog has a valid excuse for refusing to perform its contractual obligations as Real Plastic breached the contract by failing to deliver the synthetic leather by 12 April, the stipulated time for performance.

### Remedies:

1. For Knock-Out:
   - Real Plastic should deliver the synthetic leather to Knock-Out by 19 April as agreed.
   - If Knock-Out refuses to accept the delivery on 19 April, Real Plastic may seek damages for breach of contract.

2. For Copy Dog:
   - Real Plastic may be liable for damages to Copy Dog for failing to deliver the synthetic leather by 12 April.
   - The measure of damages would typically be the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of the breach, which is $4 per meter ($24 - $20) for 200,000 meters, totaling $800,000.
   - Additionally, Copy Dog may claim any consequential losses resulting from the breach, such as loss of business or damage to commercial relationships.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (KONWALL CONSTRUCTION & ENGINEERING CO., LTD. v STRONG PROGRESS LIMITED)
In the case of KONWALL CONSTRUCTION & ENGINEERING CO., LTD. v STRONG PROGRESS LIMITED (precedent p), the court ruled that the Defendant had no legal basis to refuse delivery of the Subject Orders and rejected all the defences on liability raised by the Defendant. The court found that the Defendant's contentions were inconsistent with the words used in the Sales Contract and not supported by the factual matrix. The court also refused to imply terms into the contract that were not necessary to give business efficacy to the Sales Contract.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in KONWALL CONSTRUCTION & ENGINEERING CO., LTD. v STRONG PROGRESS LIMITED and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Breach of Contract**: In both cases, the defendants failed to fulfil their contractual obligations. In precedent p, the Defendant refused to deliver the steel bars as per the contract. In the current case, Real Plastic informed Knock-Out and Copy Dog that it could not fulfil both orders on time.
- **Legal Concept 2: Implied Terms**: In precedent p, the court refused to imply terms into the contract that were not necessary to give business efficacy. Similarly, in the current case, any implied terms regarding the delivery date or conditions would need to be scrutinized under the same principle.
- **Legal Concept 3: Mitigation of Loss**: In precedent p, the court discussed the duty to mitigate losses and found that the Plaintiff had not failed to mitigate its losses. In the current case, Real Plastic offered a discount to mitigate the delay, and Knock-Out accepted a revised delivery date, which shows an attempt to mitigate losses.
- **Legal Concept 4: Remoteness of Damages**: In precedent p, the court addressed the issue of remoteness of damages and found that the losses claimed were not too remote. In the current case, the market price fluctuation and the subsequent actions of Knock-Out and Copy Dog will need to be evaluated for remoteness of damages.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (KONWALL CONSTRUCTION & ENGINEERING CO., LTD. v STRONG PROGRESS LIMITED)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a breach of contract where the defendant fails to fulfil their contractual obligations (fact pattern i*), the court should decide that the defendant is liable for the breach and cannot refuse delivery based on unsubstantiated defences (outcome o). This rule was justified in KONWALL CONSTRUCTION & ENGINEERING CO., LTD. v STRONG PROGRESS LIMITED because the positive effects (E+) of enforcing the clear terms of the contract and ensuring that parties adhere to their contractual obligations outweigh the negative effects (E-) of allowing parties to evade their responsibilities based on unfounded claims. This upholds the underlying values of contractual certainty and fairness in commercial transactions.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (KONWALL CONSTRUCTION & ENGINEERING CO., LTD. v STRONG PROGRESS LIMITED) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Breach of Contract**: Real Plastic informed Knock-Out and Copy Dog that it could not fulfil both orders on time, which constitutes a breach of contract. This is similar to the defendant in the precedent case who failed to deliver the steel bars as per the contract.
- **Legal Concept 2: Implied Terms**: In the precedent case, the court refused to imply terms into the contract that were not necessary to give business efficacy. Similarly, in the current case, any implied terms regarding the delivery date or conditions would need to be scrutinized under the same principle. The contract between Knock-Out and Real Plastic stipulated that time was of the essence, and any deviation from this would need to be explicitly agreed upon.
- **Legal Concept 3: Mitigation of Loss**: Real Plastic offered a discount to mitigate the delay, and Knock-Out accepted a revised delivery date, which shows an attempt to mitigate losses. This is akin to the plaintiff in the precedent case who did not fail to mitigate its losses.
- **Legal Concept 4: Remoteness of Damages**: In the precedent case, the court addressed the issue of remoteness of damages and found that the losses claimed were not too remote. In the current case, the market price fluctuation and the subsequent actions of Knock-Out and Copy Dog will need to be evaluated for remoteness of damages. The sudden drop in demand for crocodile skin and the price plummet to $12 per meter are factors that need to be considered.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in the precedent case. This decision would be justified because, as in KONWALL CONSTRUCTION & ENGINEERING CO., LTD. v STRONG PROGRESS LIMITED, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Enforcing Contractual Obligations**: Upholding the clear terms of the contract ensures that parties adhere to their contractual obligations, promoting certainty and reliability in commercial transactions.
2. **Fairness and Equity**: Allowing Real Plastic to evade its responsibilities based on the power surge incident would be unfair to Knock-Out and Copy Dog, who entered into the contracts in good faith.
3. **Mitigation of Losses**: Both parties attempted to mitigate their losses, and the court should recognize these efforts rather than penalize them for circumstances beyond their control.
4. **Market Stability**: Enforcing the contract terms helps maintain stability in the market by ensuring that parties cannot unilaterally alter agreements based on market fluctuations.

Therefore, Real Plastic should not be excused from its contractual obligations, and Knock-Out and Copy Dog do not have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations. Real Plastic should be entitled to remedies for the breach of contract, including damages for the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of delivery, as well as any additional costs incurred in preparing to perform the contracts.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case KONWALL CONSTRUCTION & ENGINEERING CO., LTD. v STRONG PROGRESS LIMITED, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the defendant had enough stock in its warehouse to satisfy the subject orders and did not require much time to procure supplies. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—enforcing the clear terms of the contract and ensuring that parties adhere to their contractual obligations—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it demonstrated that the defendant's refusal to deliver was not justified by any practical constraints. However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as Real Plastic experienced a significant and unforeseen power surge that caused major damage to its equipment, making it impossible to fulfil both orders on time. This unforeseen event introduces a practical constraint that was not present in the precedent case.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—market price fluctuation and the subsequent actions of Knock-Out and Copy Dog—that was not present in KONWALL CONSTRUCTION & ENGINEERING CO., LTD. v STRONG PROGRESS LIMITED. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the sudden drop in demand for crocodile skin and the price plummet to $12 per meter occurred after the contracts were modified and before the delivery date. Due to this market fluctuation, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as unfairly penalizing Real Plastic for circumstances beyond its control and failing to account for the changed market conditions, unlike in KONWALL CONSTRUCTION & ENGINEERING CO., LTD. v STRONG PROGRESS LIMITED because the precedent case did not involve such a drastic and sudden change in market conditions that affected the feasibility and fairness of enforcing the original contract terms.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **KONWALL CONSTRUCTION & ENGINEERING CO., LTD. v STRONG PROGRESS LIMITED** should be stated as: "When both [a breach of contract where the defendant fails to fulfil their contractual obligations] and [the defendant has the practical ability to fulfil the contract but chooses not to] are present, the court should decide [that the defendant is liable for the breach and cannot refuse delivery based on unsubstantiated defences]." Omitting [the defendant has the practical ability to fulfil the contract but chooses not to] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of penalizing parties for circumstances beyond their control, such as unforeseen events that genuinely prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations]. Indeed, the opinion in **KONWALL CONSTRUCTION & ENGINEERING CO., LTD. v STRONG PROGRESS LIMITED** explicitly states that the defendant had enough stock in its warehouse to satisfy the subject orders and did not require much time to procure supplies, which was crucial to their decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **KONWALL CONSTRUCTION & ENGINEERING CO., LTD. v STRONG PROGRESS LIMITED** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of allowing parties to evade their contractual responsibilities without a valid reason, thereby undermining the certainty and reliability of commercial transactions]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [parties evading their responsibilities without a valid reason] occurring because Real Plastic experienced a significant and unforeseen power surge that caused major damage to its equipment, making it genuinely impossible to fulfil both orders on time. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of the defendant having the practical ability to fulfil the contract but choosing not to, which was present in the precedent case KONWALL CONSTRUCTION & ENGINEERING CO., LTD. v STRONG PROGRESS LIMITED, requiring this factor for all similar cases of breach of contract would lead to the undesirable consequence of penalizing parties for circumstances beyond their control, such as unforeseen events that genuinely prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations. Conversely, not requiring the defendant's practical ability to fulfil the contract would allow for a more equitable outcome, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and justice in contract law. This approach ensures that parties are not unfairly held liable for breaches caused by unforeseen and uncontrollable events, thereby maintaining the integrity and fairness of contractual relationships.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of the defendant having the practical ability to fulfil the contract but choosing not to, which was present in KONWALL CONSTRUCTION & ENGINEERING CO., LTD. v STRONG PROGRESS LIMITED, we have the additional factor of Real Plastic's proactive attempt to mitigate the breach by offering a discount and negotiating new delivery terms. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of a breach of contract, serves a similar function to the practical ability factor in the precedent case. Given the presence of Real Plastic's mitigation efforts, we submit that the reasoning in KONWALL CONSTRUCTION & ENGINEERING CO., LTD. v STRONG PROGRESS LIMITED still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as fairness, equity, and the encouragement of good faith negotiations would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **KONWALL CONSTRUCTION & ENGINEERING CO., LTD. v STRONG PROGRESS LIMITED**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the breach of contract where the defendant fails to fulfil their contractual obligations and the discussion on implied terms and mitigation of loss. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the unforeseen power surge that caused major damage to Real Plastic's equipment, making it genuinely impossible to fulfil both orders on time.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case, which states that the defendant is liable for the breach and cannot refuse delivery based on unsubstantiated defences, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the unforeseen and uncontrollable events in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point from the initial analogy that enforcing contractual obligations promotes certainty and reliability in commercial transactions, and the strong point from the rebuttal that penalizing parties for circumstances beyond their control would be unfair and unjust.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, equity, and the encouragement of good faith negotiations, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Real Plastic's inability to fulfil both orders on time due to the unforeseen power surge constitutes a valid excuse for its breach of contract. Therefore, Knock-Out and Copy Dog do not have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations based on the revised delivery terms agreed upon with Real Plastic.

Real Plastic should be entitled to remedies for the breach of contract, including damages for the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of delivery, as well as any additional costs incurred in preparing to perform the contracts. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by recognizing the impact of unforeseen events on contractual obligations.


# Contract Law: Whether the clause 'time being of the essence' affects the breach of contract analysis

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 11

Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 12 Subsection 1

### Major Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 11

   Conditions:
   - Stipulations in contracts, as to time or otherwise, would not, before 13 October 1873, have been deemed to be or to have become of the essence of such contracts in the court in its equitable jurisdiction

   Consequences:
   - Such stipulations shall receive in the court the same construction and effect as they would formerly have received in equity

   Exceptions:
   - None

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 12 Subsection 1

   Conditions:
   - A different intention does not appear from the terms of the contract
   - The stipulations are as to time of payment in a contract of sale

   Consequences:
   - Stipulations as to time of payment are not deemed to be of the essence of a contract of sale

   Exceptions:
   - Any other stipulation as to time is of the essence of the contract depending on the terms of the contract

### Minor Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 11:
- The contract between Knock-Out and Real Plastic stipulated that time was of the essence.
- The contract between Copy Dog and Real Plastic also stipulated that time was of the essence.
- Before 13 October 1873, stipulations as to time would not have been deemed to be of the essence in the court in its equitable jurisdiction unless explicitly stated.
- In this case, both contracts explicitly stated that time was of the essence.
- Therefore, the stipulations as to time shall receive the same construction and effect as they would formerly have received in equity, meaning they are of the essence.

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 12 Subsection 1:
- The contracts do not indicate a different intention from the terms of the contract.
- The stipulations are not as to time of payment but as to the delivery date.
- Therefore, this section does not apply as it specifically addresses time of payment.

### Conclusion:

The stipulation that "time is of the essence" in the contracts between Real Plastic and both Knock-Out and Copy Dog is valid and enforceable. Knock-Out and Copy Dog do not have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations based on the change in market conditions or the clerical error regarding the delivery date.

Real Plastic can seek remedies for breach of contract. The primary remedies available to Real Plastic would be:

1. **Damages**: Real Plastic can claim damages for the loss suffered due to the breach of contract. This would include the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of breach, as well as any additional costs incurred in preparing to perform the contracts.

2. **Specific Performance**: Although less common in commercial contracts for goods, Real Plastic could potentially seek an order for specific performance, compelling Knock-Out and Copy Dog to accept and pay for the goods as per the original contract terms.

Given the facts, Real Plastic should pursue damages as the most appropriate remedy.

## Deductive Reasoning: cfa

### Relevant law:

Kensland Realty Limited v Whale View Investment Limited

### Major Premise:

1. Kensland Realty Limited v Whale View Investment Limited

   Conditions:
   - The contract contains an express clause making time of the essence.
   - The vendor fails to meet the stipulated deadline for completion.

   Consequences:
   - The vendor is in breach of an essential term entitling the purchaser to rescind the contract.

   Exceptions:
   - There is a supervening event excusing late tender.

### Minor Premise:

1. Kensland Realty Limited v Whale View Investment Limited:
- The contract between Knock-Out and Real Plastic contains an express clause making time of the essence.
- Real Plastic failed to meet the stipulated deadline for completion (12 April) for Knock-Out.
- However, Knock-Out agreed to a new delivery date of 19 April in exchange for a 10% discount, which was later recorded as 9 April due to a clerical error.
- The power surge at Real Plastic’s plant on 14 March could be considered a supervening event excusing late tender, but Knock-Out agreed to a new delivery date, thus waiving the original deadline.
- Knock-Out and Copy Dog both wrote to Real Plastic on 11 April stating they considered themselves discharged from their respective contracts due to the collapse in consumer demand for crocodile skin.

### Conclusion:

Knock-Out does not have a valid excuse for refusing to perform its contractual obligations because it agreed to a new delivery date, thus waiving the original deadline. Copy Dog, on the other hand, did not agree to a new delivery date and thus may have a valid excuse if the power surge is considered a supervening event excusing late tender.

### Remedies:

For Knock-Out:
- Real Plastic can claim damages for breach of contract, as Knock-Out agreed to a new delivery date and then refused to perform its obligations. The damages could include the difference between the contract price and the market price of synthetic leather, as well as any additional costs incurred by Real Plastic in preparing to perform the contract.

For Copy Dog:
- If the power surge is considered a supervening event excusing late tender, Copy Dog may have a valid excuse for refusing to perform its contractual obligations. In this case, Real Plastic may not be able to claim damages from Copy Dog. However, if the power surge is not considered a supervening event, Real Plastic can claim damages for breach of contract from Copy Dog as well.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA4596/2000 BETWEEN OKACHI (HONG KONG) CO. LTD Plaintiff and NOMINEE (HOLDING) LTD Defendant)
In the case of HCA4596/2000 BETWEEN OKACHI (HONG KONG) CO. LTD Plaintiff and NOMINEE (HOLDING) LTD Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that clauses 3.2, 3.3, and 4.4 were conditions of the contract, and strict compliance with these clauses was necessary. The court held that the terms of celerity and diligence were conditions, not innominate terms, and thus any failure to perform these terms amounted to a repudiatory breach, entitling the innocent party to rescind the contract.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA4596/2000 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Time of the Essence**: In both cases, the contracts explicitly stated that time was of the essence.
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA4596/2000, the contract clauses required strict compliance with time-related provisions. In the current case, the contracts between Knock-Out, Copy Dog, and Real Plastic also stipulated that time was of the essence.
- **Legal Concept 2: Breach of Condition**: The breach of a condition entitles the innocent party to rescind the contract.
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA4596/2000, the failure to comply with the conditions (clauses 3.2, 3.3, and 4.4) was considered a repudiatory breach. In the current case, Real Plastic's inability to deliver the synthetic leather on the stipulated date could be seen as a breach of the condition that time was of the essence.
- **Legal Concept 3: Commercial Significance**: The commercial significance of the terms was considered in determining whether they were conditions.
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA4596/2000, the court found that the parties attached significant commercial importance to the timely performance of the contract. In the current case, both Knock-Out and Copy Dog attached significant commercial importance to the timely delivery of the synthetic leather due to market demands.
- **Legal Concept 4: Remedies for Breach**: The remedies available for breach of a condition include rescission and damages.
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCA4596/2000, the plaintiff was entitled to rescind the contract and claim damages. In the current case, Real Plastic may seek remedies for the breach by Knock-Out and Copy Dog.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA4596/2000)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a contract stipulating that time is of the essence and a party fails to comply with this term, the court should decide that the breach constitutes a repudiatory breach, entitling the innocent party to rescind the contract and claim damages. This rule was justified in HCA4596/2000 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring strict compliance with commercially significant terms outweighed the negative effects (E-) of allowing flexibility in performance timelines. The court emphasized the importance of upholding the parties' intentions and the commercial significance they attached to timely performance.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA4596/2000 BETWEEN OKACHI (HONG KONG) CO. LTD Plaintiff and NOMINEE (HOLDING) LTD Defendant) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Time of the Essence**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both the precedent and the current case, the contracts explicitly stated that time was of the essence. In the current case, the contracts between Knock-Out, Copy Dog, and Real Plastic stipulated that delivery was to be made on 12 April, with time being of the essence.

- **Legal Concept 2: Breach of Condition**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In the precedent, the failure to comply with the conditions (clauses 3.2, 3.3, and 4.4) was considered a repudiatory breach. Similarly, in the current case, Real Plastic's inability to deliver the synthetic leather on the stipulated date (12 April) could be seen as a breach of the condition that time was of the essence.

- **Legal Concept 3: Commercial Significance**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In the precedent, the court found that the parties attached significant commercial importance to the timely performance of the contract. In the current case, both Knock-Out and Copy Dog attached significant commercial importance to the timely delivery of the synthetic leather due to market demands and their respective business commitments.

- **Legal Concept 4: Remedies for Breach**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In the precedent, the plaintiff was entitled to rescind the contract and claim damages. In the current case, Real Plastic may seek remedies for the breach by Knock-Out and Copy Dog, including potential claims for damages due to the breach of the condition that time was of the essence.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in the precedent case. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA4596/2000, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Contractual Intentions**: Enforcing the stipulation that time is of the essence respects the parties' intentions and the commercial significance they attached to timely performance. This ensures that parties can rely on the terms they have agreed upon, promoting certainty and predictability in commercial transactions.

2. **Encouraging Diligence and Prompt Performance**: By treating the failure to meet time-of-the-essence clauses as a repudiatory breach, the court incentivizes parties to act diligently and promptly in fulfilling their contractual obligations. This is particularly important in commercial contexts where timing can be critical to the success of business operations.

3. **Providing Appropriate Remedies**: Allowing the innocent party to rescind the contract and claim damages provides a fair remedy for the loss suffered due to the breach. This aligns with the principle of compensating the injured party and deterring breaches of significant contractual terms.

4. **Maintaining Commercial Integrity**: Enforcing strict compliance with time-of-the-essence clauses helps maintain the integrity of commercial agreements. It ensures that parties cannot unilaterally alter the agreed terms to their advantage, thereby preserving trust and fairness in commercial dealings.

Therefore, Real Plastic should argue that Knock-Out and Copy Dog do not have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations. Real Plastic should seek remedies for the breach, including potential claims for damages due to the failure to deliver the synthetic leather on the stipulated date.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the sudden and drastic change in market conditions, that was not present in HCA4596/2000 BETWEEN OKACHI (HONG KONG) CO. LTD Plaintiff and NOMINEE (HOLDING) LTD Defendant. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of time being of the essence.

In the precedent case, the court's decision was based on the commercial significance of timely performance and the parties' intentions. However, in our current case, the market for synthetic crocodile leather collapsed overnight due to the sudden popularity of leopard prints, which drastically reduced the market price of the synthetic leather from $24 per meter to $12 per meter.

Due to this significant market change, applying the same outcome (i.e., treating the failure to deliver on time as a repudiatory breach) in our case would have more negative consequences than positive ones. Specifically, enforcing the contract strictly despite the drastic market change would result in substantial financial loss for Knock-Out and Copy Dog, who would be forced to accept delivery of goods that have significantly depreciated in value. This would not align with the principle of fairness and would impose an undue burden on the parties, unlike in HCA4596/2000 where the market conditions remained stable.

Therefore, the presence of this significant market change in our current case suggests that the court should consider the changed circumstances and potentially allow Knock-Out and Copy Dog to discharge their contracts without being held liable for breach. This would ensure a fairer outcome that takes into account the unforeseen and drastic change in market conditions.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA4596/2000 BETWEEN OKACHI (HONG KONG) CO. LTD Plaintiff and NOMINEE (HOLDING) LTD Defendant should be stated as: "When both [time being of the essence] and [significant market change] are present, the court should decide [that the parties may be discharged from their contractual obligations without being held liable for breach]." Omitting [significant market change] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of imposing undue financial burdens on parties due to unforeseen and drastic changes in market conditions]. Indeed, the opinion in HCA4596/2000 explicitly states that the commercial significance of timely performance was crucial to their decision. However, it did not consider the impact of significant market changes, which is a critical factor in our current case.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA4596/2000 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of parties disregarding the commercial significance of timely performance and thereby undermining the contractual intentions. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because the drastic market change has fundamentally altered the commercial landscape. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should consider the significant market change and allow Knock-Out and Copy Dog to discharge their contracts without being held liable for breach, ensuring a fair and equitable outcome.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the significant market change factor, which was present in the precedent case HCA4596/2000 BETWEEN OKACHI (HONG KONG) CO. LTD Plaintiff and NOMINEE (HOLDING) LTD Defendant, requiring this factor for all similar cases of time being of the essence would lead to the undesirable consequence of undermining the contractual intentions and commercial significance attached to timely performance. Conversely, not requiring the significant market change factor would allow for the desirable outcome of upholding the parties' intentions and ensuring that the commercial significance of timely performance is respected. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which emphasize the importance of honoring the terms agreed upon by the parties and maintaining the integrity of commercial agreements.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the significant market change factor, which was present in HCA4596/2000 BETWEEN OKACHI (HONG KONG) CO. LTD Plaintiff and NOMINEE (HOLDING) LTD Defendant, we have the additional factor of the explicit stipulation that time is of the essence in the contracts between Knock-Out, Copy Dog, and Real Plastic. This explicit stipulation, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of the commercial significance attached to timely performance, serves a similar function to the significant market change factor in the precedent case. Given the presence of the explicit stipulation that time is of the essence, we submit that the reasoning in HCA4596/2000 still applies, as the positive effects on upholding contractual intentions and ensuring commercial integrity would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA4596/2000 BETWEEN OKACHI (HONG KONG) CO. LTD Plaintiff and NOMINEE (HOLDING) LTD Defendant, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly the explicit stipulation that time is of the essence and the commercial significance attached to timely performance. However, it also differs in a significant way due to the drastic and unforeseen change in market conditions for synthetic crocodile leather.

The proposed legal rule that "when both [time being of the essence] and [significant market change] are present, the court should decide [that the parties may be discharged from their contractual obligations without being held liable for breach]" finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of upholding contractual intentions and ensuring commercial integrity (as argued in the initial analogy) and the need to consider significant market changes to avoid undue financial burdens on the parties (as argued in the rebuttal).

Considering the underlying legal principles of contract law, which emphasize the importance of honoring the terms agreed upon by the parties and maintaining the integrity of commercial agreements, as well as the principle of fairness in light of unforeseen and drastic changes in market conditions, we conclude that Real Plastic should not be able to hold Knock-Out and Copy Dog liable for breach of contract.

The significant market change factor in our current case justifies allowing Knock-Out and Copy Dog to discharge their contracts without being held liable for breach. This decision aligns with the principle of fairness and ensures that parties are not unduly burdened by unforeseen and drastic changes in market conditions, while still respecting the commercial significance of timely performance in general.

Therefore, Real Plastic should consider the changed circumstances and potentially allow Knock-Out and Copy Dog to discharge their contracts without being held liable for breach. This ensures a fair and equitable outcome that takes into account the unforeseen and drastic change in market conditions.

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 53 Subsection 1, 2, 3:
- There is a contract of sale between Knock-Out and Real Plastic, and between Copy Dog and Real Plastic.
- Both contracts stipulate that time is of the essence.
- Real Plastic wrongfully neglected or refused to deliver the goods to Knock-Out and Copy Dog by the original delivery date of 12 April.
- Knock-Out and Copy Dog may maintain an action against Real Plastic for damages for non-delivery.
- The measure of damages would be the difference between the contract price ($20 per meter) and the market price at the time of the breach ($24 per meter on 12 April).

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 31 Subsection 2:
- There is a contract of sale between Knock-Out and Real Plastic, and between Copy Dog and Real Plastic.
- Both contracts stipulate that time is of the essence.
- Real Plastic is bound to send the goods to Knock-Out and Copy Dog.
- The time for sending the goods was fixed as 12 April, but Real Plastic proposed a new date of 19 April, which Knock-Out accepted with a 10% discount.

3. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 31 Subsection 3:
- There is a contract of sale between Knock-Out and Real Plastic, and between Copy Dog and Real Plastic.
- Both contracts stipulate that time is of the essence.
- Real Plastic is bound to send the goods to Knock-Out and Copy Dog.
- The goods are not in the possession of a third person at the time of sale, so this section does not apply.

4. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 33 Subsection 2:
- There is a contract of sale between Knock-Out and Real Plastic, and between Copy Dog and Real Plastic.
- Both contracts stipulate that time is of the essence.
- Real Plastic is bound to send the goods to Knock-Out and Copy Dog.
- Real Plastic did not make defective deliveries in respect of one or more instalments, so this section does not apply.

### Conclusion:

Knock-Out and Copy Dog do not have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations. Real Plastic's offer of a 5% discount for delayed delivery does not constitute a valid modification of the contract as it was not accepted by both parties. Knock-Out accepted a 10% discount and a new delivery date of 19 April, which was a valid modification. Copy Dog did not accept the modification and is entitled to damages for non-delivery.

Real Plastic can seek the following remedies:
1. Against Knock-Out: Real Plastic can enforce the modified contract with the new delivery date of 19 April and the 10% discount.
2. Against Copy Dog: Real Plastic can claim damages for non-delivery, which would be the difference between the contract price ($20 per meter) and the market price at the time of the breach ($24 per meter on 12 April), amounting to $4 per meter for 200,000 meters, totaling $800,000.

### Major Premise:

1. Williams v Roffey Brothers & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd [1991] 1 QB 1

   Conditions:
   - There is a pre-existing contract between the parties.
   - One party promises an additional payment or benefit in return for the other party's promise to perform their contractual obligations on time.
   - As a result of giving this promise, the promisor obtains in practice a benefit or obviates a disbenefit.
   - The promise is not given as a result of economic duress or fraud.

   Consequences:
   - The benefit to the promisor is capable of being consideration for the promise, making the promise legally binding.

   Exceptions:
   - The promise is given as a result of economic duress or fraud.

### Minor Premise:

1. Williams v Roffey Brothers & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd [1991] 1 QB 1:
   - There is a pre-existing contract between Knock-Out and Real Plastic for the delivery of synthetic leather.
   - Real Plastic promises a 10% discount to Knock-Out in return for Knock-Out's agreement to accept delayed delivery.
   - As a result of giving this promise, Real Plastic obviates the disbenefit of potential legal action from Knock-Out and ensures continued business relations.
   - The promise was not given as a result of economic duress or fraud, as Knock-Out willingly agreed to the new terms.

### Conclusion:

The conditions set out in Williams v Roffey Brothers & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd [1991] 1 QB 1 are satisfied, and the promise of a 10% discount by Real Plastic to Knock-Out is legally binding. Therefore, Knock-Out does not have a valid excuse for refusing to perform its contractual obligations.

### Remedies:

Since Knock-Out does not have a valid excuse for refusing to perform its contractual obligations, Real Plastic can seek the following remedies:

1. **Specific Performance**: Real Plastic can seek an order for specific performance, compelling Knock-Out to accept the delivery of the synthetic leather and pay the agreed price, minus the 10% discount.

2. **Damages**: Real Plastic can claim damages for any losses incurred due to Knock-Out's refusal to perform, including the $5 million spent preparing to perform the contract.

Regarding Copy Dog, since there was no modification of the contract and Copy Dog offered an additional payment to ensure timely delivery, Copy Dog also does not have a valid excuse for refusing to perform its contractual obligations. Real Plastic can similarly seek specific performance or damages from Copy Dog.

In the case of GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣 [2023] HKCFI 1539; HCA 13/2022 (precedent p), the court ruled that the defences of estoppel and force majeure put forward by the defendant (D) were unarguable and thus granted summary judgment in favour of the plaintiff (P). The court found that the alleged representations did not constitute a clear and unequivocal promise that P would not enforce its rights, and the force majeure defence was fundamentally flawed as it did not meet the strict requirements of the contractual clause.

Both in GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Estoppel**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the defendants claimed that the plaintiffs were estopped from enforcing their contractual rights due to alleged representations made by the plaintiffs' representatives.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Force Majeure**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In both cases, the defendants invoked force majeure clauses to excuse their non-performance, citing external events (e.g., the Pandemic and Civil War in the precedent case, and the power surge in the current case).

- **Legal Concept 3: Contractual Modification**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In both cases, there were issues related to the modification of contractual terms and whether such modifications were valid and enforceable.

- **Legal Concept 4: Summary Judgment**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In both cases, the court considered whether the defences raised by the defendants were sufficiently arguable to warrant a trial or if summary judgment should be granted.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of unarguable defences of estoppel and force majeure, the court should decide in favour of summary judgment for the plaintiff. This rule was justified in GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣 because the positive effects (E+) of outcome o on the underlying values and principles of the law, such as upholding contractual obligations and ensuring certainty in commercial transactions, outweigh the negative effects (E-) in that case. The court emphasized the need for clear and unequivocal evidence to support defences like estoppel and force majeure, and the importance of adhering to the strict requirements of contractual clauses to maintain the integrity of contractual agreements.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Estoppel**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: Knock-Out and Copy Dog might argue that Real Plastic is estopped from enforcing the original delivery date due to the subsequent agreement to delay delivery. However, as in the precedent case, any alleged representations must be clear and unequivocal, and there must be evidence that Real Plastic bound itself in law not to enforce the original terms.

- **Legal Concept 2: Force Majeure**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: Real Plastic might argue that the power surge constitutes a force majeure event excusing its non-performance. However, as in the precedent case, the force majeure clause must be strictly construed, and Real Plastic must show that the event made performance impossible, not merely inconvenient or difficult.

- **Legal Concept 3: Contractual Modification**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: The modification of the delivery date and the discount offered by Real Plastic must be valid and enforceable. As in the precedent case, any modification to the contract must meet the formal requirements stipulated in the original agreement.

- **Legal Concept 4: Summary Judgment**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: The court must consider whether the defences raised by Knock-Out and Copy Dog are sufficiently arguable to warrant a trial or if summary judgment should be granted in favour of Real Plastic.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Contractual Obligations**: Enforcing the original terms of the contract, unless validly modified, ensures that parties cannot unilaterally alter their obligations without mutual consent, thereby maintaining the integrity of contractual agreements.

2. **Ensuring Certainty in Commercial Transactions**: By requiring clear and unequivocal evidence for defences like estoppel and force majeure, the court promotes certainty and predictability in commercial transactions, which is crucial for business planning and risk management.

3. **Adhering to Formal Requirements**: Enforcing the formal requirements for contractual modifications ensures that parties cannot rely on informal or ambiguous agreements to alter their obligations, thereby reducing the potential for disputes and litigation.

4. **Preventing Unjust Enrichment**: By rejecting unarguable defences, the court prevents parties from escaping their contractual obligations based on flimsy or unsubstantiated claims, thereby ensuring that parties are held accountable for their commercial decisions.

In conclusion, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would uphold the underlying values and principles of the law, such as upholding contractual obligations, ensuring certainty in commercial transactions, adhering to formal requirements, and preventing unjust enrichment.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of clear and unequivocal evidence (factor m) regarding the alleged representations and the force majeure events. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—upholding contractual obligations and ensuring certainty in commercial transactions—outweighed any potential drawbacks because the court had concrete evidence to assess the validity of the defences raised by the defendant.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of clear and unequivocal evidence is notably absent. Real Plastic's offer of a 5% discount for delayed delivery and the subsequent communications with Knock-Out and Copy Dog do not provide the same level of clear and unequivocal evidence regarding the modification of the contract or the invocation of force majeure. The communications were informal and contained clerical errors, which undermine their reliability and clarity. Therefore, the absence of clear and unequivocal evidence in our current case makes it difficult to justify the same outcome as in the precedent case.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—clerical errors and informal communications (factor m)—that was not present in **GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the clerical errors and informal nature of the communications between Real Plastic and Knock-Out introduce ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the modification of the contract and the agreed-upon terms.

Due to these clerical errors and informal communications, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as increased litigation and disputes over the interpretation of contractual terms, than positive ones. Unlike in **GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣**, where the court had clear and unequivocal evidence to base its decision on, the presence of clerical errors and informal communications in our current case introduces significant ambiguity, making it inappropriate to grant summary judgment in favour of Real Plastic without a thorough examination of the facts and evidence.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣** should be stated as: "When both [the fact pattern of unarguable defences of estoppel and force majeure] and [clear and unequivocal evidence] are present, the court should decide [in favour of summary judgment for the plaintiff]." Omitting [clear and unequivocal evidence] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q], which is the increased likelihood of unjust outcomes due to the reliance on ambiguous or informal communications that do not meet the stringent requirements for modifying contractual obligations or invoking force majeure. Indeed, the opinion in **GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣** explicitly states that [clear and unequivocal evidence] was crucial to their decision, as the court emphasized the need for clear and unequivocal evidence to support defences like estoppel and force majeure.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣** was clearly designed to prevent [undesirable consequence u], which is the undermining of contractual certainty and the potential for parties to escape their obligations based on flimsy or unsubstantiated claims. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [u] occurring because the communications between Real Plastic and Knock-Out were informal and contained clerical errors, introducing significant ambiguity. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—ensuring clear and unequivocal evidence for modifying contractual obligations or invoking force majeure—is not relevant to our situation due to the lack of such evidence.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks clear and unequivocal evidence, which was present in the precedent case **GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of unarguable defences of estoppel and force majeure would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would allow parties to escape their contractual obligations based on informal or ambiguous communications, thereby undermining the certainty and predictability essential for commercial transactions. Conversely, not requiring clear and unequivocal evidence would allow for a more flexible approach that considers the practical realities of business communications, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, such as fairness and the intention of the parties.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks clear and unequivocal evidence, which was present in **GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣**, we have the additional factor of clerical errors and informal communications. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of unarguable defences of estoppel and force majeure, serves a similar function to clear and unequivocal evidence in the precedent case. Given the presence of clerical errors and informal communications, we submit that the reasoning in **GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣** still applies, as the positive effects on upholding contractual obligations and ensuring certainty in commercial transactions would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in the legal concepts of estoppel, force majeure, and contractual modification. However, it also differs significantly in the presence of clerical errors and informal communications, which introduce ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the modification of the contract and the agreed-upon terms.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case—that when both the fact pattern of unarguable defences of estoppel and force majeure and clear and unequivocal evidence are present, the court should decide in favour of summary judgment for the plaintiff—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the absence of clear and unequivocal evidence in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that requiring clear and unequivocal evidence ensures contractual certainty and prevents parties from escaping their obligations based on flimsy or unsubstantiated claims. Conversely, the counterargument that the presence of clerical errors and informal communications introduces significant ambiguity, making it inappropriate to grant summary judgment without a thorough examination of the facts and evidence, is also compelling.

Considering the underlying legal principles of upholding contractual obligations, ensuring certainty in commercial transactions, and adhering to formal requirements, we conclude that Real Plastic's offer of a 5% discount for delayed delivery does not constitute a valid modification of the contract due to the lack of clear and unequivocal evidence. Therefore, Knock-Out and Copy Dog do not have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations based on the alleged modification.

However, given the clerical errors and informal communications, it would be unjust to grant summary judgment without a thorough examination of the facts and evidence. Real Plastic should seek remedies through a full trial where the ambiguities and the parties' intentions can be properly assessed.

In conclusion, while the precedent case provides valuable guidance, the unique factors in the current case necessitate a different approach. The court should not grant summary judgment in favour of Real Plastic but should instead allow the case to proceed to trial to ensure a fair and just resolution.

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 31 Subsection 2:
   - There is a contract of sale between Knock-Out and Real Plastic.
   - Real Plastic is bound to send the goods to Knock-Out.
   - The time for sending the goods was fixed as 12 April, later modified to 19 April (or 9 April due to clerical error).
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 31 Subsection 3:
   - There is a contract of sale between Knock-Out and Real Plastic.
   - Real Plastic is bound to send the goods to Knock-Out.
   - The goods are not in the possession of a third person.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

3. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 32 Subsections 1-4:
   - There is a contract of sale between Knock-Out and Real Plastic.
   - Real Plastic has not yet delivered the goods to Knock-Out.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

4. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 33 Subsection 2:
   - There is a contract for the sale of goods between Knock-Out and Real Plastic.
   - The contract is for the sale of goods to be delivered by stated instalments (not applicable here as it is a single delivery).
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

### Conclusion:

None of the sections of the Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 directly apply to the scenario involving Knock-Out and Real Plastic. However, the principle of contract law regarding the modification of contracts and the doctrine of frustration may be relevant.

### Analysis:

1. **Modification of Contract**:
   - Copy Dog's offer of 10% extra to receive the goods on time constitutes a valid modification of the contract if Real Plastic accepts it. This is because both parties have agreed to the new terms, which include additional consideration (10% extra payment).

2. **Frustration of Contract**:
   - The power surge at Real Plastic’s plant may be considered a frustrating event, making it impossible for Real Plastic to perform its obligations under the original terms. However, since Real Plastic offered alternative terms and Knock-Out accepted them, the contract was effectively modified.

### Conclusion:

- **Copy Dog**: Copy Dog's offer of 10% extra to receive the goods on time constitutes a valid modification of the contract. Real Plastic can enforce this modified contract.
- **Knock-Out**: Knock-Out agreed to a new delivery date of 19 April with a 10% discount. This constitutes a valid modification of the contract. Knock-Out cannot refuse to perform its contractual obligations based on the original terms.

### Remedies:

- **For Copy Dog**: Real Plastic can claim the additional 10% payment as agreed in the modified contract.
- **For Knock-Out**: Real Plastic can enforce the modified contract terms, requiring Knock-Out to accept delivery on 19 April with a 10% discount.

Real Plastic should proceed with legal action to enforce the modified contracts and seek damages for any losses incurred due to the breach by Knock-Out and Copy Dog.

### Relevant law:

Williams v Roffey Brothers & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd [1991] 1 QB 1

### Major Premise:

1. Williams v Roffey Brothers & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd [1991] 1 QB 1

   Conditions:
   - A has entered into a contract with B to do work for, or to supply goods or services to, B in return for payment by B.
   - At some stage before A has completely performed his obligations under the contract, B has reason to doubt whether A will, or will be able to, complete his side of the bargain.
   - B thereupon promises A an additional payment in return for A’s promise to perform his contractual obligations on time.
   - As a result of giving his promise, B obtains in practice a benefit, or obviates a disbenefit.
   - B’s promise is not given as a result of economic duress or fraud on the part of A.

   Consequences:
   - The benefit to B is capable of being consideration for B’s promise, so that the promisee will be legally binding.

   Exceptions:
   - The promise is given as a result of economic duress or fraud on the part of A.

### Minor Premise:

1. Williams v Roffey Brothers & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd [1991] 1 QB 1:
- Real Plastic (A) has entered into a contract with Copy Dog (B) to supply synthetic leather in return for payment by Copy Dog.
- Before Real Plastic has completely performed its obligations under the contract, Copy Dog has reason to doubt whether Real Plastic will be able to complete its side of the bargain due to the power surge incident.
- Copy Dog thereupon promises Real Plastic an additional 10% payment in return for Real Plastic’s promise to deliver the goods on time.
- As a result of giving this promise, Copy Dog obtains a benefit by ensuring it can meet its commitments to its retailers.
- Copy Dog’s promise is not given as a result of economic duress or fraud on the part of Real Plastic.

### Conclusion:

The conditions set out in Williams v Roffey Brothers & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd [1991] 1 QB 1 are satisfied, and the promise of an additional 10% payment by Copy Dog constitutes valid consideration. Therefore, the modification of the contract is legally binding.

### Additional Analysis:

Regarding Knock-Out's situation, the agreement to accept a 10% discount for delayed delivery also constitutes a valid modification of the contract, as it was agreed upon without economic duress or fraud.

### Remedies:

Real Plastic can seek the following remedies:

1. **For Copy Dog:**
   - Specific performance to enforce the modified contract terms, requiring Copy Dog to pay the additional 10% and accept delivery.
   - Damages for breach of contract if Copy Dog refuses to perform under the modified terms.

2. **For Knock-Out:**
   - Specific performance to enforce the modified contract terms, requiring Knock-Out to accept delivery on 19 April with the agreed 10% discount.
   - Damages for breach of contract if Knock-Out refuses to perform under the modified terms.

Real Plastic should proceed with legal action to enforce the modified contracts and seek compensation for any losses incurred due to the breach by Knock-Out and Copy Dog.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (CACV 170/2017)
In the case of CACV 170/2017 BETWEEN 胡潔敏 (WU KIT MAN) Claimant AND 龍威集團控股有限公司 Respondent (DRAGONWAY GROUP HOLDINGS LIMITED) (precedent p), the court dealt with the issue of whether an addendum to an employment contract was supported by valid consideration. The court ruled that the matter should be remitted to the Labour Tribunal for retrial on the question of consideration, as the initial judgment did not sufficiently explore whether the addendum provided a real benefit to the employer, which could constitute valid consideration.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in CACV 170/2017 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Consideration in Contract Modifications**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In CACV 170/2017, the court examined whether the addendum to the employment contract was supported by valid consideration. Similarly, in our current case, we need to determine whether Copy Dog's offer of 10% extra to receive the goods on time constitutes valid consideration for modifying the delivery date.

- **Legal Concept 2: Practical Benefit as Consideration**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In CACV 170/2017, the court considered whether the employer received a practical benefit from the employee's continued employment, which could serve as valid consideration. In our current case, we need to assess whether Real Plastic received a practical benefit from Copy Dog's offer of 10% extra, which could validate the modification of the contract.

- **Legal Concept 3: Economic Duress**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In CACV 170/2017, the court noted that consideration must not be given as a result of economic duress. In our current case, we must determine whether Copy Dog's offer of 10% extra was made under economic duress or was a genuine modification of the contract.

- **Legal Concept 4: Remittance for Further Fact-Finding**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In CACV 170/2017, the court remitted the case for further fact-finding on the issue of consideration. In our current case, if the facts are not sufficiently clear, a similar remittance for further fact-finding may be necessary.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (CACV 170/2017)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a contract modification where the consideration is questioned, the court should decide to remit the case for further fact-finding to determine whether a real benefit was provided and whether the consideration was free from economic duress. This rule was justified in CACV 170/2017 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that contract modifications are supported by valid consideration and free from duress uphold the underlying values of fairness and contractual integrity, which outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially prolonging litigation. 

Therefore, in our current case, the court should similarly remit the matter for further fact-finding to determine whether Copy Dog's offer of 10% extra constitutes valid consideration for the modification of the delivery date, ensuring that the principles of fairness and contractual integrity are upheld.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (CACV 170/2017) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Consideration in Contract Modifications**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In CACV 170/2017, the court examined whether the addendum to the employment contract was supported by valid consideration. Similarly, in our current case, we need to determine whether Copy Dog's offer of 10% extra to receive the goods on time constitutes valid consideration for modifying the delivery date.

- **Legal Concept 2: Practical Benefit as Consideration**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In CACV 170/2017, the court considered whether the employer received a practical benefit from the employee's continued employment, which could serve as valid consideration. In our current case, we need to assess whether Real Plastic received a practical benefit from Copy Dog's offer of 10% extra, which could validate the modification of the contract.

- **Legal Concept 3: Economic Duress**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In CACV 170/2017, the court noted that consideration must not be given as a result of economic duress. In our current case, we must determine whether Copy Dog's offer of 10% extra was made under economic duress or was a genuine modification of the contract.

- **Legal Concept 4: Remittance for Further Fact-Finding**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In CACV 170/2017, the court remitted the case for further fact-finding on the issue of consideration. In our current case, if the facts are not sufficiently clear, a similar remittance for further fact-finding may be necessary.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome of remitting the matter for further fact-finding to determine whether Copy Dog's offer of 10% extra constitutes valid consideration for the modification of the delivery date. This decision would be justified because, as in CACV 170/2017, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Fairness**: Ensuring that contract modifications are supported by valid consideration and free from duress upholds the principles of fairness and equity in contractual relationships.
2. **Contractual Integrity**: By thoroughly investigating the issue of consideration, the court ensures that the integrity of contractual agreements is maintained, preventing parties from unilaterally altering terms without proper justification.
3. **Legal Certainty**: A detailed examination of the facts provides clarity and certainty in the application of the law, which is beneficial for all parties involved and for future similar cases.

Therefore, the court should remit the matter for further fact-finding to determine the validity of the consideration in the modification of the contract between Real Plastic and Copy Dog. This approach aligns with the principles established in CACV 170/2017 and ensures that the underlying values of fairness, contractual integrity, and legal certainty are upheld.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case CACV 170/2017, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the factor of **economic duress**. Economic duress was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—such as upholding fairness and contractual integrity—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it ensured that the addendum to the employment contract was not agreed upon under undue pressure, thus maintaining the voluntariness of contractual agreements. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of **economic duress** is notably absent as there is no indication that Knock-Out or Copy Dog were under any undue pressure or coercion when they made their respective offers to Real Plastic. The absence of economic duress in the current case means that the modification of the contract terms was likely made voluntarily and without coercion.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor of **market price fluctuation** that was not present in CACV 170/2017. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of consideration in contract modifications. Because of the drastic change in the market price of synthetic crocodile leather—from $24 per meter to $12 per meter—applying the same outcome of remitting the matter for further fact-finding would have more negative consequences than positive ones. The negative consequences include potential financial losses for Real Plastic, which has already spent $5 million preparing to perform both contracts, and the destabilization of commercial relationships due to the sudden market shift. Unlike in CACV 170/2017, where the focus was on the fairness and voluntariness of the contract modification, the current case's market price fluctuation introduces a significant economic impact that must be considered. Therefore, the presence of this factor suggests that the court should not simply remit the matter for further fact-finding but should also consider the economic realities and potential financial harm involved.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from CACV 170/2017 should be stated as: "When both the fact pattern of a contract modification where the consideration is questioned (i*) and the absence of economic duress (m) are present, the court should decide to remit the case for further fact-finding to determine whether a real benefit was provided and whether the consideration was free from economic duress (o)." Omitting the absence of economic duress (m) from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence (q) of enforcing contract modifications that were agreed upon under coercion or undue pressure, thereby undermining the fairness and voluntariness of contractual agreements. Indeed, the opinion in CACV 170/2017 explicitly states that the consideration must not be given as a result of economic duress, highlighting the relevance of this factor to their decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in CACV 170/2017 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence (u) of enforcing contract modifications that were agreed upon under economic duress, thereby ensuring that contractual agreements are made voluntarily and fairly. However, in our current case, there is no risk of economic duress occurring. The facts indicate that both Knock-Out and Copy Dog made their respective offers to Real Plastic voluntarily and without any undue pressure. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule of remitting the matter for further fact-finding here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—preventing economic duress—is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should consider the economic realities and potential financial harm involved due to the market price fluctuation, which was not a factor in CACV 170/2017.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of economic duress, which was present in the precedent case CACV 170/2017, requiring this factor for all similar cases of contract modification where the consideration is questioned would lead to the undesirable consequence of potentially ignoring other significant factors that could affect the fairness and validity of the contract modification. Conversely, not requiring economic duress would allow for a more comprehensive evaluation of the circumstances surrounding the contract modification, including market price fluctuations and the practical benefits to the parties involved. This approach better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which aim to ensure fairness, uphold the integrity of contractual agreements, and consider the economic realities faced by the parties.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of economic duress, which was present in CACV 170/2017, we have the additional factor of significant market price fluctuation. This market price fluctuation, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of contract modification and the question of consideration, serves a similar function to economic duress in the precedent case. Given the presence of this market price fluctuation, we submit that the reasoning in CACV 170/2017 still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values—such as ensuring fairness, maintaining contractual integrity, and considering economic realities—would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to CACV 170/2017, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in the context of contract modifications and the question of consideration. However, it also differs significantly in the absence of economic duress and the presence of significant market price fluctuation.

The proposed legal rule of remitting the case for further fact-finding to determine whether a real benefit was provided and whether the consideration was free from economic duress finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially given the unique economic circumstances in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of ensuring fairness and contractual integrity (as argued in the initial analogy) and the need to consider economic realities and potential financial harm (as argued in the rebuttal). Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, contractual integrity, and the practical benefits to the parties involved, we conclude that the court should not simply remit the matter for further fact-finding.

Instead, the court should take into account the significant market price fluctuation and the absence of economic duress. The practical benefit to Real Plastic from Copy Dog's offer of 10% extra should be evaluated in light of the economic realities faced by the parties. Therefore, the court should determine whether the modification of the contract terms was made voluntarily and whether it provided a real benefit to Real Plastic.

In conclusion, Real Plastic should be advised that Knock-Out and Copy Dog do not have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations based solely on the market price fluctuation. The court should consider the practical benefits and the economic context in which the contract modifications were made. This approach aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency.

### Minor Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 12 Subsection 1:
- There is a contract for the sale of goods between Knock-Out and Real Plastic.
- The contract stipulates that time is of the essence.
- Real Plastic delivers the goods later than the stipulated time.
- Knock-Out accepts the late delivery in exchange for a 10% discount.
- The modification is supported by consideration as Knock-Out agreed to a 10% discount.

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 37 Subsection 4:
- There is a contract for the sale of goods between Copy Dog and Real Plastic.
- Real Plastic delivers the goods later than the stipulated time.
- Copy Dog has not retained the goods as they were not delivered yet.
- Copy Dog intimates to Real Plastic that it has rejected the goods within a reasonable time.

3. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 37 Subsection 5:
- There is a contract for the sale of goods between Copy Dog and Real Plastic.
- Real Plastic delivers the goods later than the stipulated time.
- Copy Dog has not retained the goods as they were not delivered yet.
- Copy Dog intimates to Real Plastic that it has rejected the goods within a reasonable time.

### Conclusion:

1. Knock-Out's acceptance of a 10% discount for delayed delivery constitutes a valid modification of the contract under Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 12 Subsection 1. Therefore, Knock-Out does not have a valid excuse for refusing to perform its contractual obligations.

2. Copy Dog has intimated to Real Plastic that it has rejected the goods within a reasonable time, and the goods were not delivered yet. Therefore, Copy Dog has a valid excuse for refusing to perform its contractual obligations under Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 37 Subsection 4 and 5.

### Remedies:

Real Plastic can seek the following remedies:

1. Against Knock-Out:
   - Real Plastic can claim damages for breach of contract as Knock-Out does not have a valid excuse for refusing to perform its contractual obligations. The damages would be the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of breach, along with any additional costs incurred by Real Plastic.

2. Against Copy Dog:
   - Since Copy Dog has a valid excuse for refusing to perform its contractual obligations, Real Plastic cannot claim damages from Copy Dog.

### Relevant law:

Sun Hing Dyeing Factory Ltd v Tactway Far East (Holding) Limited

### Major Premise:

1. Sun Hing Dyeing Factory Ltd v Tactway Far East (Holding) Limited

   Conditions:
   - There is a valid accord and satisfaction or valid compromise agreement.
   - The agreement is supported by consideration.
   - The agreement is not vitiated by misrepresentation.

   Consequences:
   - The compensation agreement is valid and binding.

   Exceptions:
   - The agreement was not made in good faith.
   - The agreement was not supported by valid consideration.

### Minor Premise:

1. Sun Hing Dyeing Factory Ltd v Tactway Far East (Holding) Limited:

   - There is a valid compromise agreement between Knock-Out and Real Plastic, where Knock-Out agreed to accept a 10% discount for delayed delivery.
   - The agreement is supported by consideration: Knock-Out agreed to a later delivery date in exchange for a 10% discount.
   - There is no indication that the agreement was vitiated by misrepresentation.
   - The agreement was made in good faith, as both parties were aware of the circumstances and negotiated the terms accordingly.
   - The agreement was supported by valid consideration, as the 10% discount constitutes consideration for Knock-Out's acceptance of the delayed delivery.

### Conclusion:

The agreement between Knock-Out and Real Plastic constitutes a valid modification of the contract. Therefore, Knock-Out does not have a valid excuse for refusing to perform its contractual obligations.

### Remedies:

Since Knock-Out does not have a valid excuse for refusing to perform its contractual obligations, Real Plastic may seek the following remedies:

1. **Specific Performance**: Real Plastic could seek an order for specific performance, requiring Knock-Out to accept the delivery of the synthetic leather as per the modified agreement.
2. **Damages**: Real Plastic could claim damages for any losses incurred due to Knock-Out's refusal to perform its contractual obligations. This could include the difference in market price and any additional costs incurred by Real Plastic.

Regarding Copy Dog, since there was no modification of the contract and Copy Dog unilaterally offered 10% extra to receive the goods as scheduled, Real Plastic can claim damages for breach of contract due to Copy Dog's refusal to perform its contractual obligations. The damages could include the difference in market price and any additional costs incurred by Real Plastic.

### Conclusion:

Real Plastic can seek specific performance or damages from Knock-Out and damages from Copy Dog for their refusal to perform their contractual obligations.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (RESOURCES LEADER LTD v. HO NGO YING)

In the case of RESOURCES LEADER LTD v. HO NGO YING (precedent p), the court dealt with the issue of whether requisitions on title were raised within a reasonable time when the contract was silent on the specific time frame. The court ruled that requisitions must be raised no later than 14 days before the completion date, based on established conveyancing practice and the implied term of raising requisitions within a reasonable time. The court also held that any waiver of the time limit for raising requisitions must be clear and unequivocal.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in RESOURCES LEADER LTD v. HO NGO YING and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Implied Terms in Contracts**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In RESOURCES LEADER LTD v. HO NGO YING, the court implied a term that requisitions must be raised within a reasonable time when the contract was silent on the specific time frame. Similarly, in our current case, the contract between Knock-Out and Real Plastic implied that time was of the essence for delivery.

- **Legal Concept 2: Reasonable Time for Performance**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** The court in RESOURCES LEADER LTD v. HO NGO YING determined what constituted a reasonable time for raising requisitions. In our current case, the concept of reasonable time is relevant to the modification of the delivery date from 12 April to 19 April.

- **Legal Concept 3: Waiver of Contractual Rights**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** The court in RESOURCES LEADER LTD v. HO NGO YING discussed the conditions under which a waiver of the time limit for raising requisitions could be considered valid. In our current case, the issue is whether Knock-Out's acceptance of a 10% discount for delayed delivery constitutes a valid modification or waiver of the original delivery date.

- **Legal Concept 4: Clear and Unequivocal Conduct**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** The court in RESOURCES LEADER LTD v. HO NGO YING emphasized that any waiver of contractual rights must be clear and unequivocal. In our current case, the communications between Real Plastic and Knock-Out must be examined to determine if there was a clear and unequivocal agreement to modify the delivery date.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (RESOURCES LEADER LTD v. HO NGO YING)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of implied terms and the need for clear and unequivocal conduct to modify contractual obligations, the court should decide that any modification or waiver must be explicit and unambiguous. This rule was justified in RESOURCES LEADER LTD v. HO NGO YING because it ensures that both parties have a clear understanding of their rights and obligations, thereby promoting certainty and fairness in contractual relationships.

In the precedent case, the positive effects (E+) of requiring clear and unequivocal conduct to modify contractual obligations include promoting legal certainty and protecting the parties' expectations. The negative effects (E-) of not requiring such clarity could lead to disputes and misunderstandings, undermining the stability of contractual agreements.

Therefore, applying this rule to our current case, Knock-Out's acceptance of a 10% discount for delayed delivery must be examined to determine if it was clear and unequivocal. If it was, then Knock-Out has validly modified the contract and cannot refuse performance. If it was not clear and unequivocal, then Knock-Out may not have a valid excuse for refusing to perform its contractual obligations. Similarly, Copy Dog's attempt to offer 10% extra to receive the goods as scheduled must also be examined under this rule.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (RESOURCES LEADER LTD v. HO NGO YING) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Implied Terms in Contracts**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In RESOURCES LEADER LTD v. HO NGO YING, the court implied a term that requisitions must be raised within a reasonable time when the contract was silent on the specific time frame. Similarly, in our current case, the contract between Knock-Out and Real Plastic implied that time was of the essence for delivery.

- **Legal Concept 2: Reasonable Time for Performance**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** The court in RESOURCES LEADER LTD v. HO NGO YING determined what constituted a reasonable time for raising requisitions. In our current case, the concept of reasonable time is relevant to the modification of the delivery date from 12 April to 19 April.

- **Legal Concept 3: Waiver of Contractual Rights**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** The court in RESOURCES LEADER LTD v. HO NGO YING discussed the conditions under which a waiver of the time limit for raising requisitions could be considered valid. In our current case, the issue is whether Knock-Out's acceptance of a 10% discount for delayed delivery constitutes a valid modification or waiver of the original delivery date.

- **Legal Concept 4: Clear and Unequivocal Conduct**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** The court in RESOURCES LEADER LTD v. HO NGO YING emphasized that any waiver of contractual rights must be clear and unequivocal. In our current case, the communications between Real Plastic and Knock-Out must be examined to determine if there was a clear and unequivocal agreement to modify the delivery date.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in RESOURCES LEADER LTD v. HO NGO YING, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Promoting Legal Certainty:** By requiring clear and unequivocal conduct to modify contractual obligations, the court ensures that both parties have a clear understanding of their rights and obligations. This promotes certainty and stability in contractual relationships, which is crucial for commercial transactions.

2. **Protecting Parties' Expectations:** The rule ensures that parties cannot unilaterally alter the terms of a contract without clear and mutual agreement. This protects the expectations of both parties and prevents disputes arising from ambiguous or implied modifications.

3. **Encouraging Good Faith and Fair Dealing:** By upholding the requirement for clear and unequivocal conduct, the court encourages parties to act in good faith and deal fairly with each other. This fosters a more trustworthy and reliable business environment.

4. **Preventing Unjust Enrichment:** The rule prevents one party from taking advantage of the other by claiming a modification that was not clearly agreed upon. This ensures that neither party is unjustly enriched at the expense of the other.

Therefore, applying the rule from RESOURCES LEADER LTD v. HO NGO YING to our current case, Knock-Out's acceptance of a 10% discount for delayed delivery must be examined to determine if it was clear and unequivocal. If it was, then Knock-Out has validly modified the contract and cannot refuse performance. If it was not clear and unequivocal, then Knock-Out may not have a valid excuse for refusing to perform its contractual obligations. Similarly, Copy Dog's attempt to offer 10% extra to receive the goods as scheduled must also be examined under this rule.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **RESOURCES LEADER LTD v. HO NGO YING**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the concept of **waiver of contractual rights**. This concept was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as promoting legal certainty and protecting parties' expectations, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it required clear and unequivocal conduct to modify contractual obligations. However, in our current case, this crucial concept of **waiver of contractual rights** is notably absent as the issue at hand is not about waiving a right but rather about modifying the delivery date and the terms of the contract due to unforeseen circumstances.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor **(the unforeseen power surge and subsequent damage to Real Plastic's plant)** that was not present in **RESOURCES LEADER LTD v. HO NGO YING**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces an element of **force majeure** or **impossibility of performance**. Due to this unforeseen event, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as unfairly penalizing Real Plastic for circumstances beyond its control, unlike in **RESOURCES LEADER LTD v. HO NGO YING** where the issue was about the timing of requisitions and waiver of rights. The presence of this unforeseen event necessitates a different legal analysis, potentially invoking doctrines related to frustration of contract or force majeure, which were not relevant in the precedent case.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from **RESOURCES LEADER LTD v. HO NGO YING** should be stated as: "When both [implied terms in contracts regarding time being of the essence] and [the presence of an unforeseen event causing impossibility of performance] are present, the court should decide [that the contract may be modified or discharged based on the unforeseen event]." Omitting [the presence of an unforeseen event causing impossibility of performance] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of unfairly penalizing a party for circumstances beyond their control, thereby undermining the principles of fairness and equity in contract law]. Indeed, the opinion in **RESOURCES LEADER LTD v. HO NGO YING** explicitly states that [the court's decision was based on the clear and unequivocal conduct of the parties in the absence of unforeseen events, which was crucial to their decision].

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in **RESOURCES LEADER LTD v. HO NGO YING** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties unilaterally altering the terms of a contract without clear and mutual agreement, thereby promoting legal certainty and protecting parties' expectations]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [parties unilaterally altering the terms without mutual agreement] occurring because the modification of the delivery date was a mutual agreement between Real Plastic and Knock-Out, and the unforeseen event (power surge) was beyond the control of Real Plastic. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The unforeseen event introduces a different legal consideration, potentially invoking doctrines related to frustration of contract or force majeure, which were not relevant in the precedent case.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the specific factor of "waiver of contractual rights," which was present in the precedent case **RESOURCES LEADER LTD v. HO NGO YING**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of implied terms and clear and unequivocal conduct would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would unfairly penalize parties for circumstances beyond their control, such as unforeseen events causing impossibility of performance. Conversely, not requiring the factor of "waiver of contractual rights" would allow for a more equitable outcome, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and equity in contract law. This approach ensures that parties are not held to impossible standards due to unforeseen events, thereby promoting justice and fairness in contractual relationships.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of "waiver of contractual rights," which was present in **RESOURCES LEADER LTD v. HO NGO YING**, we have the additional factor of "unforeseen event causing impossibility of performance." This unforeseen event, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of implied terms and the need for clear and unequivocal conduct, serves a similar function to the waiver of contractual rights in the precedent case. Given the presence of this unforeseen event, we submit that the reasoning in **RESOURCES LEADER LTD v. HO NGO YING** still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as fairness, equity, and the promotion of good faith in contractual dealings would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. This ensures that Real Plastic is not unfairly penalized for circumstances beyond its control and that the contractual obligations are adjusted in a manner that is just and equitable for all parties involved.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **RESOURCES LEADER LTD v. HO NGO YING**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the importance of implied terms in contracts and the necessity for clear and unequivocal conduct to modify contractual obligations. However, it also differs significantly due to the presence of an unforeseen event causing impossibility of performance, which was not a factor in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule from **RESOURCES LEADER LTD v. HO NGO YING**—that any modification or waiver of contractual obligations must be clear and unequivocal—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered in light of the unforeseen event in the current case. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the need for legal certainty and the protection of parties' expectations (as emphasized in the precedent) against the fairness and equity considerations introduced by the unforeseen event in the current case.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, equity, and the promotion of good faith in contractual dealings, we conclude that the unforeseen event (the power surge) introduces a different legal consideration that necessitates a more flexible approach. This approach should account for the doctrines related to frustration of contract or force majeure, which were not relevant in the precedent case.

Therefore, we find that Knock-Out's acceptance of a 10% discount for delayed delivery constitutes a valid modification of the contract, given that it was a mutual agreement and not a unilateral alteration. Knock-Out does not have a valid excuse for refusing to perform its contractual obligations. Similarly, Copy Dog's attempt to offer 10% extra to receive the goods as scheduled does not constitute a valid modification, as it was not mutually agreed upon.

Real Plastic should be entitled to remedies for breach of contract by both Knock-Out and Copy Dog. These remedies may include damages for the costs incurred in preparing to perform both contracts and any additional losses suffered due to the breach.

In conclusion, the decision reached aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by considering the unique circumstances of the unforeseen event. This ensures that Real Plastic is not unfairly penalized for circumstances beyond its control and that the contractual obligations are adjusted in a manner that is just and equitable for all parties involved.


# Contract Law: Whether the clerical error recording the new delivery date as 9 April affects the contractual obligations

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Sections 32, 33, and 53

### Major Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 32

   Conditions:
   - There is a contract for the sale of goods.
   - The seller delivers to the buyer a quantity of goods less than he contracted to sell.
   - The seller delivers to the buyer a quantity of goods larger than he contracted to sell.
   - The seller delivers to the buyer the goods he contracted to sell mixed with goods of a different description not included in the contract.

   Consequences:
   - The buyer may reject the goods.
   - If the buyer accepts the goods so delivered, he must pay for them at the contract rate.
   - The buyer may accept the goods included in the contract and reject the rest.
   - The buyer may reject the whole.

   Exceptions:
   - There is any usage of trade.
   - There is a special agreement.
   - There is a course of dealing between the parties.

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 33

   Conditions:
   - There is a contract for the sale of goods.
   - The buyer of goods is not bound to accept delivery thereof by instalments.
   - There is a contract for the sale of goods to be delivered by stated instalments, which are to be separately paid for.
   - The seller makes defective deliveries in respect of one or more instalments.
   - The buyer neglects or refuses to take delivery of or pay for one or more instalments.

   Consequences:
   - It is a question in each case depending on the terms of the contract and the circumstances of the case, whether the breach of contract is a repudiation of the whole contract.
   - It is a severable breach giving rise to a claim for compensation but not to a right to treat the whole contract as repudiated.

   Exceptions:
   - Unless otherwise agreed.

3. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 53

   Conditions:
   - There is a contract for the sale of goods.
   - The seller wrongfully neglects or refuses to deliver the goods to the buyer.

   Consequences:
   - The buyer may maintain an action against the seller for damages for non-delivery.
   - The measure of damages is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the seller's breach of contract.
   - Where there is an available market for the goods in question, the measure of damages is prima facie to be ascertained by the difference between the contract price and the market or current price of the goods at the time or times when they ought to have been delivered, or, if no time was fixed for delivery, then at the time of the neglect or refusal to deliver.

   Exceptions:
   - None.

### Minor Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 32:
   - There is a contract for the sale of goods between Knock-Out and Real Plastic.
   - Real Plastic did not deliver the goods as contracted by 12 April.
   - Knock-Out agreed to a new delivery date of 19 April with a 10% discount.
   - Due to a clerical error, the new delivery date was recorded as 9 April.
   - Knock-Out and Copy Dog both wrote to Real Plastic on 11 April stating they considered themselves discharged from their respective contracts.

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 33:
   - There is a contract for the sale of goods between Knock-Out and Real Plastic.
   - The contract stipulated delivery by 12 April, time being of the essence.
   - Knock-Out agreed to a new delivery date of 19 April with a 10% discount.
   - The clerical error recorded the new delivery date as 9 April.
   - Knock-Out and Copy Dog both wrote to Real Plastic on 11 April stating they considered themselves discharged from their respective contracts.

3. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 53:
   - There is a contract for the sale of goods between Knock-Out and Real Plastic.
   - Real Plastic informed Knock-Out and Copy Dog on 15 March that it would not be able to fulfil its contractual undertakings by 12 April.
   - Knock-Out agreed to a new delivery date of 19 April with a 10% discount.
   - Knock-Out and Copy Dog both wrote to Real Plastic on 11 April stating they considered themselves discharged from their respective contracts.

### Conclusion:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 32 does not apply as the issue is not about the quantity or description of goods delivered but about the delivery date.

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 33 applies. The breach of contract by Real Plastic (failure to deliver by 12 April) was addressed by a new agreement to deliver by 19 April with a 10% discount. The clerical error recording the new delivery date as 9 April does not affect the contractual obligations as the parties had agreed to 19 April. Knock-Out and Copy Dog cannot consider themselves discharged from the contract based on the clerical error.

3. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 53 applies. Real Plastic's failure to deliver by 12 April constitutes a breach of contract. Knock-Out and Copy Dog may maintain an action against Real Plastic for damages for non-delivery. The measure of damages would be the difference between the contract price ($20 per meter) and the market price ($12 per meter) at the time of the breach.

### Conclusion:

Knock-Out and Copy Dog do not have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations. Real Plastic can seek damages for non-delivery from Knock-Out and Copy Dog, calculated as the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of the breach.

### Major Premise:

1. Kou Lau Ru Ling v Tse Sui Luen

   Conditions:
   - The notices, fairly construed, overwhelmingly demonstrate to any reasonable recipient the Plaintiffs' desire to exercise the option in accordance with the terms of the Deed and not any other regime.
   - The erroneous date is immediately qualified by the correct terms of the Deed.

   Consequences:
   - The erroneous date may be ignored as immaterial and the notices are valid exercises of the options.

   Exceptions:
   - The misstatement of the date causes the plaintiffs themselves to act in breach of contract.

### Minor Premise:

1. Kou Lau Ru Ling v Tse Sui Luen:
- The communications between Real Plastic and Knock-Out, fairly construed, overwhelmingly demonstrate to any reasonable recipient (including Real Plastic) Knock-Out's desire to accept the new delivery date in accordance with the terms of the revised agreement and not any other regime.
- The erroneous date of 9 April is immediately qualified by the correct terms of the revised agreement, which was for delivery on 19 April.
- The misstatement of the date does not cause Knock-Out to act in breach of contract, as the intent and agreement were clear and understood by both parties.

### Conclusion:

The clerical error recording the new delivery date as 9 April does not affect the contractual obligations between Real Plastic and Knock-Out. The erroneous date may be ignored as immaterial, and the notices are valid exercises of the options.

### Additional Analysis:

#### Knock-Out's Refusal to Perform:

Knock-Out's refusal to perform its contractual obligations on 11 April, citing the collapse in consumer demand, does not constitute a valid excuse for discharge from the contract. The contract was still valid and enforceable, and the clerical error regarding the delivery date does not provide a basis for Knock-Out to consider itself discharged.

#### Copy Dog's Refusal to Perform:

Copy Dog's refusal to perform its contractual obligations on 11 April, similarly citing the collapse in consumer demand, also does not constitute a valid excuse for discharge from the contract. Copy Dog had no agreement to change the delivery date and was still bound by the original terms.

### Remedies Available to Real Plastic:

1. **Damages for Breach of Contract:**
   - Real Plastic can claim damages from both Knock-Out and Copy Dog for breach of contract. The measure of damages would typically be the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of breach, along with any additional costs incurred by Real Plastic in preparing to perform the contracts.

2. **Specific Performance:**
   - Although specific performance is an equitable remedy and not commonly granted in cases involving the sale of goods, Real Plastic could argue for specific performance if the synthetic leather is unique or if damages would not adequately compensate for the breach.

3. **Mitigation of Loss:**
   - Real Plastic has a duty to mitigate its losses. Given the plummeting price of synthetic crocodile leather, Real Plastic should attempt to sell the leather at the current market price to minimize its losses.

### Conclusion:

Real Plastic should pursue claims for damages against both Knock-Out and Copy Dog for breach of contract. The clerical error regarding the delivery date does not affect the validity of the revised agreement with Knock-Out, and both parties' refusal to perform based on market changes does not constitute a valid excuse for discharge from their contractual obligations.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (SIT KWONG LAM v. PETROLIMEX SINGAPORE PTE. LTD)

In the case of SIT KWONG LAM v. PETROLIMEX SINGAPORE PTE. LTD [2019] HKCA 1220; CACV 215/2019 (precedent p), the court dealt with a bankruptcy order against Sit Kwong Lam ("the Debtor") due to a debt of over US$30 million. The Debtor argued that the debt was subject to an arbitration clause, and thus the bankruptcy petition should be stayed or dismissed. The court ruled that the reference to an arbitration clause in the PG Addendum was a clerical mistake, as there was no arbitration clause in the Personal Guarantee. The court held that the arbitration clause in the Settlement Agreement was not incorporated into the PG Addendum and dismissed the Debtor’s appeal (outcome o).

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in SIT KWONG LAM v. PETROLIMEX SINGAPORE PTE. LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Clerical Mistake in Contractual Documents**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In SIT KWONG LAM, the PG Addendum referred to a non-existent arbitration clause in the Personal Guarantee, which was deemed a clerical mistake. In our current case, the last few communications between Real Plastic and Knock-Out recorded the new delivery date as 9 April due to a clerical error.

- **Legal Concept 2: Interpretation of Contractual Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In SIT KWONG LAM, the court interpreted the contractual terms to ascertain the parties' intentions and corrected the clerical mistake by construction. In our current case, the interpretation of the delivery date in the contract between Real Plastic and Knock-Out is crucial to determine the parties' obligations.

- **Legal Concept 3: Objective Intention of the Parties**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In SIT KWONG LAM, the court considered the objective intention of the parties when interpreting the contract. In our current case, the objective intention of Real Plastic and Knock-Out regarding the delivery date needs to be considered.

- **Legal Concept 4: Performance of Contractual Obligations**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In SIT KWONG LAM, the performance of the Debtor's obligations under the Personal Guarantee was in question. In our current case, the performance of Real Plastic's obligation to deliver the synthetic leather on the agreed date is in question.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (SIT KWONG LAM v. PETROLIMEX SINGAPORE PTE. LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see a clerical mistake in a contractual document (fact pattern i*), the court should correct the mistake by construction to reflect the objective intention of the parties (outcome o). This rule was justified in SIT KWONG LAM v. PETROLIMEX SINGAPORE PTE. LTD because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that the contract reflects the true intention of the parties and upholding the integrity of contractual agreements outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially altering the written terms of the contract.

Applying this rule to our current case, the clerical error recording the new delivery date as 9 April should be corrected to reflect the true intention of the parties, which was to have the delivery on 19 April. Therefore, Knock-Out and Copy Dog do not have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations based on the clerical error. Real Plastic can seek remedies for breach of contract, including damages for the loss incurred due to the non-performance by Knock-Out and Copy Dog.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (SIT KWONG LAM v. PETROLIMEX SINGAPORE PTE. LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Clerical Mistake in Contractual Documents**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In SIT KWONG LAM, the PG Addendum referred to a non-existent arbitration clause in the Personal Guarantee, which was deemed a clerical mistake. In our current case, the last few communications between Real Plastic and Knock-Out recorded the new delivery date as 9 April due to a clerical error.

- **Legal Concept 2: Interpretation of Contractual Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In SIT KWONG LAM, the court interpreted the contractual terms to ascertain the parties' intentions and corrected the clerical mistake by construction. In our current case, the interpretation of the delivery date in the contract between Real Plastic and Knock-Out is crucial to determine the parties' obligations.

- **Legal Concept 3: Objective Intention of the Parties**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In SIT KWONG LAM, the court considered the objective intention of the parties when interpreting the contract. In our current case, the objective intention of Real Plastic and Knock-Out regarding the delivery date needs to be considered.

- **Legal Concept 4: Performance of Contractual Obligations**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In SIT KWONG LAM, the performance of the Debtor's obligations under the Personal Guarantee was in question. In our current case, the performance of Real Plastic's obligation to deliver the synthetic leather on the agreed date is in question.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in SIT KWONG LAM v. PETROLIMEX SINGAPORE PTE. LTD. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Contractual Integrity**: Correcting the clerical error to reflect the true intention of the parties upholds the integrity of the contractual agreement. This ensures that the contract is enforced as the parties originally intended, which is a fundamental principle of contract law.

2. **Promoting Fairness**: By correcting the clerical error, the court ensures that neither party is unfairly prejudiced by a mistake that does not reflect their true agreement. This promotes fairness and equity in contractual dealings.

3. **Providing Certainty and Predictability**: Correcting clerical errors in contracts provides certainty and predictability in commercial transactions. Parties can rely on the fact that their true intentions will be honored, even if clerical mistakes occur.

4. **Encouraging Diligence**: While correcting clerical errors, the court also encourages parties to be diligent in drafting and reviewing their contracts. This helps to minimize the occurrence of such errors in the future.

Therefore, Real Plastic should be able to correct the clerical error regarding the delivery date to reflect the true intention of the parties, which was to have the delivery on 19 April. Consequently, Knock-Out and Copy Dog do not have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations based on the clerical error. Real Plastic can seek remedies for breach of contract, including damages for the loss incurred due to the non-performance by Knock-Out and Copy Dog.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **SIT KWONG LAM v. PETROLIMEX SINGAPORE PTE. LTD**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of a **non-existent arbitration clause** in the Personal Guarantee. This non-existent clause was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—correcting the clerical mistake to reflect the true intention of the parties—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it was clear that the parties had mistakenly referred to an arbitration clause that did not exist, and the court could correct this mistake without altering the substantive terms of the agreement.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of a **non-existent clause** is notably absent. Instead, the clerical error pertains to the **delivery date** of the synthetic leather, which is a substantive term of the contract. The error in the delivery date does not involve a non-existent clause but rather a miscommunication of an agreed-upon term. This distinction is significant because correcting a non-existent clause is a matter of clarifying an obvious mistake, whereas altering a substantive term like the delivery date could have broader implications on the parties' obligations and expectations.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—**the sudden change in market conditions**—that was not present in **SIT KWONG LAM v. PETROLIMEX SINGAPORE PTE. LTD**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of a clerical mistake. Due to the sudden collapse in consumer demand for crocodile skin and the plummeting price of synthetic crocodile leather, applying the same outcome (correcting the clerical error) in our case would have more negative consequences, such as unfairly binding Knock-Out and Copy Dog to a contract that has become commercially disadvantageous due to unforeseen market changes.

In **SIT KWONG LAM**, the correction of the clerical mistake did not involve any significant change in market conditions or the commercial viability of the contract. However, in our current case, the market conditions have drastically changed, making the enforcement of the original contract terms potentially unjust and commercially unreasonable. Therefore, the presence of this market change factor means that applying the same outcome would not be appropriate, as it would lead to negative consequences such as economic loss and unfairness to the parties involved.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **SIT KWONG LAM v. PETROLIMEX SINGAPORE PTE. LTD** should be stated as: "When both [clerical mistake in contractual documents] and [no significant change in market conditions] are present, the court should decide [to correct the clerical mistake by construction to reflect the objective intention of the parties]." Omitting [no significant change in market conditions] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q], which is unfairly binding parties to a contract that has become commercially disadvantageous due to unforeseen market changes. Indeed, the opinion in **SIT KWONG LAM v. PETROLIMEX SINGAPORE PTE. LTD** explicitly states that the correction of the clerical mistake was justified because it did not alter the substantive terms of the agreement and reflected the true intention of the parties without any significant external changes affecting the contract's viability.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **SIT KWONG LAM v. PETROLIMEX SINGAPORE PTE. LTD** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of enforcing a contract based on a clerical mistake that does not reflect the true intention of the parties]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [enforcing a contract based on a clerical mistake that does not reflect the true intention of the parties] because the significant change in market conditions (the collapse in consumer demand for crocodile skin and the plummeting price of synthetic crocodile leather) fundamentally alters the commercial context of the contract. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The drastic change in market conditions means that enforcing the original contract terms would lead to unfairness and economic loss, which the rule in **SIT KWONG LAM** was not designed to address.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction

While it's true that our case lacks the factor of a non-existent arbitration clause, which was present in the precedent case **SIT KWONG LAM v. PETROLIMEX SINGAPORE PTE. LTD**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of clerical mistakes in contractual documents would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would mean that any clerical error involving substantive terms, such as delivery dates, could not be corrected by the court, even if it clearly did not reflect the true intention of the parties. This would result in parties being unfairly bound by mistakes that neither intended, leading to potential economic loss and unjust outcomes. Conversely, not requiring the factor of a non-existent clause would allow for the correction of clerical errors in substantive terms, ensuring that contracts reflect the true intentions of the parties. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which aim to uphold the integrity and fairness of contractual agreements.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution

Although our case lacks the factor of a non-existent arbitration clause, which was present in **SIT KWONG LAM v. PETROLIMEX SINGAPORE PTE. LTD**, we have the additional factor of a significant change in market conditions. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of a clerical mistake in contractual documents, serves a similar function to the non-existent clause in the precedent case. Given the presence of the significant change in market conditions, we submit that the reasoning in **SIT KWONG LAM v. PETROLIMEX SINGAPORE PTE. LTD** still applies. The positive effects on legal values, such as ensuring fairness and reflecting the true intention of the parties, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. The drastic change in market conditions reinforces the need to correct the clerical error to prevent unjust and commercially unreasonable outcomes.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **SIT KWONG LAM v. PETROLIMEX SINGAPORE PTE. LTD**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of a clerical mistake in contractual documents and the need to interpret contractual terms to reflect the objective intention of the parties. However, it also differs significantly in that our current case involves a substantive term (the delivery date) and a drastic change in market conditions, which were not present in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule from **SIT KWONG LAM v. PETROLIMEX SINGAPORE PTE. LTD**—that clerical mistakes should be corrected by construction to reflect the objective intention of the parties—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the significant change in market conditions in our current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that correcting the clerical error ensures contractual integrity and fairness (as argued in the initial analogy) and the counterargument that the drastic change in market conditions makes enforcing the original contract terms potentially unjust and commercially unreasonable (as argued in the rebuttal).

Considering the underlying legal principles of ensuring fairness, upholding the true intention of the parties, and maintaining the integrity of contractual agreements, we conclude that the clerical error regarding the delivery date should be corrected to reflect the true intention of the parties, which was to have the delivery on 19 April. This correction aligns with the principle of contractual integrity and fairness, as it ensures that the contract reflects what the parties originally intended.

However, given the significant change in market conditions, Real Plastic should also consider the commercial realities and potential economic loss. While Knock-Out and Copy Dog do not have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations based on the clerical error, Real Plastic may need to negotiate a commercially reasonable solution to mitigate potential losses and maintain business relationships.

Therefore, Real Plastic can seek remedies for breach of contract, including damages for the loss incurred due to the non-performance by Knock-Out and Copy Dog. However, it should also be open to negotiating a settlement that reflects the changed market conditions to avoid prolonged litigation and further economic loss.

In conclusion, the decision to correct the clerical error and enforce the contract as intended is justified, but it should be balanced with practical considerations of the current market situation. This approach serves justice and legal consistency while also addressing the commercial realities faced by the parties.

## Deductive Reasoning: ca

### Relevant law:

Vember Lord Ltd v. The Swatch Group (Hong Kong) Ltd [2023] HKCA 371

### Major Premise:

1. Vember Lord Ltd v. The Swatch Group (Hong Kong) Ltd [2023] HKCA 371

   Conditions:
   - There is a supervening event that thwarts the commonly held purposes by the parties when they entered into the contract.
   - The contractual obligations are rendered radically or fundamentally different from what was agreed upon in the contract.
   - The performance of the contract is futile in light of the supervening event.

   Consequences:
   - The contract may be considered frustrated.

   Exceptions:
   - The primary obligation to lease has not been rendered impossible by the supervening event.
   - The supervening event does not affect the occupation or use of the premises physically or their use as retail space.

### Minor Premise:

1. Vember Lord Ltd v. The Swatch Group (Hong Kong) Ltd [2023] HKCA 371:

   - There is a supervening event: The collapse in consumer demand for crocodile skin and the price drop to $12 per meter.
   - The commonly held purpose by the parties when they entered into the contract was to profit from the sale of synthetic crocodile leather accessories.
   - The contractual obligations (delivery of synthetic leather) are not rendered radically or fundamentally different from what was agreed upon in the contract. The nature of the goods and the delivery terms remain the same.
   - The performance of the contract is not futile in light of the supervening event. The synthetic leather can still be delivered and used for its intended purpose, albeit at a lower market value.

   Exceptions:
   - The primary obligation to deliver synthetic leather has not been rendered impossible by the supervening event.
   - The supervening event does not affect the physical occupation or use of the synthetic leather.

### Conclusion:

The collapse in consumer demand for crocodile skin and the price drop to $12 per meter does not constitute frustration of the contract. Knock-Out and Copy Dog do not have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations.

### Remedies:

Real Plastic may seek the following remedies:

1. **Specific Performance**: Real Plastic can request the court to order Knock-Out and Copy Dog to perform their contractual obligations and accept delivery of the synthetic leather at the agreed price of $20 per meter.

2. **Damages**: Real Plastic can claim damages for any losses incurred due to the breach of contract by Knock-Out and Copy Dog. This may include the difference between the contract price and the market price, as well as any additional costs incurred in preparing to perform the contracts.

3. **Mitigation of Loss**: Real Plastic should take reasonable steps to mitigate its losses, such as finding alternative buyers for the synthetic leather at the current market price of $12 per meter. Any failure to mitigate losses may reduce the amount of damages recoverable.

In summary, Real Plastic has strong grounds to enforce the contracts and seek appropriate remedies for the breach by Knock-Out and Copy Dog.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR")
In the case of WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" (precedent p), the defendants argued that the social unrest and the COVID-19 pandemic had frustrated the tenancy agreements due to the drastic decline in business and tourist numbers. The court ruled that the doctrine of frustration did not apply because the fundamental nature of the contractual obligations had not changed, and the risk of economic downturn was implicitly borne by the tenant (outcome o).

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Doctrine of Frustration**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the parties argued that unforeseen events (social unrest and pandemic in precedent p; collapse in consumer demand in current case c) had drastically affected their ability to perform the contract.

- **Legal Concept 2: Risk Allocation**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In both cases, the court had to determine whether the risk of the unforeseen event was implicitly allocated to one of the parties under the contract.

- **Legal Concept 3: Fundamental Change in Obligations**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In both cases, the court examined whether the unforeseen events had fundamentally changed the nature of the contractual obligations.

- **Legal Concept 4: Economic Hardship**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In both cases, the parties experienced significant economic hardship due to the unforeseen events and argued that this should discharge them from their contractual obligations.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR")
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern i* (unforeseen events causing economic hardship but not fundamentally changing the nature of the contractual obligations), the court should decide that the doctrine of frustration does not apply, and the parties remain bound by their contractual obligations (outcome o). This rule was justified in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" because the positive effects (E+) of maintaining contractual certainty and upholding the implicit risk allocation in commercial agreements outweighed the negative effects (E-) of economic hardship on the party seeking to invoke frustration.

Applying this rule to the current case, Real Plastic can argue that the collapse in consumer demand for crocodile skin and the price drop to $12 per meter do not constitute frustration of the contract. The fundamental nature of the contractual obligations (delivery of synthetic leather) has not changed, and the risk of market fluctuations was implicitly borne by Knock-Out and Copy Dog. Therefore, Knock-Out and Copy Dog do not have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations. Real Plastic may seek remedies for breach of contract, including damages for the costs incurred in preparing to perform the contracts.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR") are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Doctrine of Frustration**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the parties argued that unforeseen events (social unrest and pandemic in the precedent; collapse in consumer demand in the current case) had drastically affected their ability to perform the contract.

- **Legal Concept 2: Risk Allocation**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In both cases, the court had to determine whether the risk of the unforeseen event was implicitly allocated to one of the parties under the contract.

- **Legal Concept 3: Fundamental Change in Obligations**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In both cases, the court examined whether the unforeseen events had fundamentally changed the nature of the contractual obligations.

- **Legal Concept 4: Economic Hardship**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In both cases, the parties experienced significant economic hardship due to the unforeseen events and argued that this should discharge them from their contractual obligations.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR". This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Maintaining Contractual Certainty**: Upholding the contracts despite the unforeseen events would reinforce the principle that contracts are binding agreements, providing certainty and predictability in commercial transactions. This is crucial for the stability of business relationships and the economy at large.

2. **Implicit Risk Allocation**: The decision would respect the implicit risk allocation agreed upon by the parties. In commercial contracts, parties often implicitly accept certain risks, such as market fluctuations. By holding Knock-Out and Copy Dog to their contractual obligations, the court would affirm that these risks were part of the bargain they struck.

3. **Preventing Opportunistic Behavior**: Allowing parties to escape their contractual obligations due to economic hardship alone could encourage opportunistic behavior, where parties might seek to avoid contracts simply because they have become less profitable. This would undermine the integrity of contractual agreements.

4. **Economic Efficiency**: Enforcing the contracts would promote economic efficiency by ensuring that resources are allocated according to the agreements made by the parties. This would discourage wasteful litigation and encourage parties to carefully consider and manage risks when entering into contracts.

Therefore, Real Plastic can argue that the collapse in consumer demand for crocodile skin and the price drop to $12 per meter do not constitute frustration of the contract. The fundamental nature of the contractual obligations (delivery of synthetic leather) has not changed, and the risk of market fluctuations was implicitly borne by Knock-Out and Copy Dog. Consequently, Knock-Out and Copy Dog do not have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations. Real Plastic may seek remedies for breach of contract, including damages for the costs incurred in preparing to perform the contracts.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR", the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the premises were still available for the defendants to continue their business operations. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—maintaining contractual certainty and upholding the implicit risk allocation—outweighed any potential drawbacks, such as the economic hardship faced by the defendants. The court emphasized that the fundamental nature of the contractual obligations had not changed, and the tenants could still operate their businesses, albeit under more challenging conditions.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent. Unlike the tenants in the precedent case who could still operate their businesses, Knock-Out and Copy Dog are dealing with a situation where the market demand for the product they ordered (synthetic crocodile leather) has collapsed entirely. This collapse in demand fundamentally affects the commercial purpose of the contract, which was to produce and sell accessories made from synthetic crocodile leather. The drastic change in market conditions means that the product is no longer viable for its intended commercial use, which is a significant deviation from the situation in the precedent case.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR". This factor is the complete collapse in consumer demand for the product in question, which significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern. In the precedent case, the tenants faced economic hardship but could still operate their businesses. In contrast, Knock-Out and Copy Dog are facing a situation where the product they ordered has lost its market value entirely, rendering the contract commercially impracticable.

Due to this collapse in demand, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as forcing Knock-Out and Copy Dog to accept and pay for a product that has become commercially worthless. This would not only result in significant financial losses for them but also undermine the principle of fairness in contractual obligations. Unlike in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR", where the tenants could still derive some value from the premises, Knock-Out and Copy Dog would derive no value from the synthetic leather due to the unforeseen market collapse. Therefore, the presence of this factor in the current case significantly alters the balance of positive and negative effects, making the application of the same outcome inappropriate.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" should be stated as "When both [i*] (unforeseen events causing economic hardship but not fundamentally changing the nature of the contractual obligations) and [m] (the ability to continue deriving some value from the contract despite the unforeseen events) are present, the court should decide [o] (the doctrine of frustration does not apply, and the parties remain bound by their contractual obligations)." Omitting [m] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q] (forcing parties to accept and pay for goods or services that have become commercially worthless due to unforeseen events). Indeed, the opinion in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" explicitly states that the ability to continue operating the business was crucial to their decision, as it ensured that the fundamental nature of the contractual obligations had not changed.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" was clearly designed to prevent [undesirable consequence u] (parties escaping their contractual obligations due to economic hardship alone, thereby undermining contractual certainty and predictability). However, in our current case, there's no risk of [u] occurring because the collapse in consumer demand for synthetic crocodile leather has rendered the product commercially worthless, fundamentally altering the commercial purpose of the contract. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The fundamental change in market conditions means that the product is no longer viable for its intended commercial use, which is a significant deviation from the situation in the precedent case.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the ability to continue deriving some value from the contract despite the unforeseen events (factor m), which was present in the precedent case WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR", requiring this factor for all similar cases of unforeseen events causing economic hardship but not fundamentally changing the nature of the contractual obligations (fact pattern i*) would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would force parties to accept and pay for goods or services that have become commercially worthless due to unforeseen events. Conversely, not requiring the ability to continue deriving some value from the contract would allow for a more equitable outcome, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area. The principle of fairness in contractual obligations would be upheld, ensuring that parties are not unduly penalized for circumstances entirely beyond their control that render the contract commercially impracticable.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the ability to continue deriving some value from the contract despite the unforeseen events (factor m), which was present in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR", we have the additional factor of a complete collapse in consumer demand for the product (factor n). This collapse in demand, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of unforeseen events causing economic hardship (fact pattern i*), serves a similar function to the ability to continue deriving some value from the contract in the precedent case. Given the presence of the complete collapse in consumer demand, we submit that the reasoning in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" still applies, as the positive effects on fairness and equitable treatment in contractual obligations would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. Therefore, Real Plastic should recognize that Knock-Out and Copy Dog have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations due to the fundamental change in the commercial viability of the contract.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR", the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the invocation of the doctrine of frustration due to unforeseen events causing economic hardship and the need to determine whether the risk of these events was implicitly allocated to one of the parties under the contract. However, it also differs significantly in that the current case involves a complete collapse in consumer demand for the product, which fundamentally alters the commercial purpose of the contract.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case—that the doctrine of frustration does not apply when unforeseen events cause economic hardship but do not fundamentally change the nature of the contractual obligations—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the complete collapse in consumer demand in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point from Real Plastic that maintaining contractual certainty and upholding implicit risk allocation are crucial for commercial stability. On the other hand, the argument from Knock-Out and Copy Dog that the collapse in consumer demand has rendered the contract commercially impracticable and fundamentally altered its purpose is also compelling.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness in contractual obligations and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the collapse in consumer demand for synthetic crocodile leather does constitute a fundamental change in the commercial purpose of the contract. Therefore, the doctrine of frustration should apply in this case, discharging Knock-Out and Copy Dog from their respective contracts.

This decision is reached because the unforeseen market collapse has rendered the product commercially worthless, fundamentally altering the nature of the contractual obligations. Forcing Knock-Out and Copy Dog to accept and pay for goods that have become commercially impracticable would be unjust and contrary to the principles of fairness in contractual obligations. Thus, Real Plastic should recognize that Knock-Out and Copy Dog have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations.

   - The court shall give effect to the said provision and shall only give effect to section 16 to such extent, if any, as appears to the court to be consistent with the said provision.

   Exceptions:
   - None.

### Minor Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 1 and 2:
   - The contract between Knock-Out and Real Plastic, and the contract between Copy Dog and Real Plastic, are governed by Hong Kong law.
   - The contracts have not become impossible of performance or been otherwise frustrated. The power surge at Real Plastic’s plant does not render the contracts impossible to perform; it merely delays performance.
   - Therefore, the conditions for frustration under this section are not met.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3:
   - Neither Knock-Out nor Copy Dog has obtained a valuable benefit from Real Plastic before the time of discharge.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

3. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 17 Subsection 3:
   - The contracts do not contain any provision intended to have effect in the event of circumstances arising which operate, or would but for the said provision operate, to frustrate the contract.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

### Conclusion:

The Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Sections 16 and 17 do not apply to the scenario as the contracts have not been frustrated. Knock-Out and Copy Dog do not have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations. Real Plastic may seek remedies for breach of contract, including damages for any losses incurred due to the breach.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR")

In the case of WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" [2022] HKCFI 2036; HCA 954/2020 (precedent p), the court dealt with a situation where the tenant sought rent abatement and claimed frustration of the lease due to extraordinary and unforeseen events, namely social unrest and the COVID-19 pandemic, which drastically reduced the number of tourists and affected the tenant's business. The court ruled that the tenant was not entitled to claim frustration of the lease as the events did not render the performance of the contract radically different from what was contemplated. However, the court allowed the tenant to argue for rent abatement and counterclaims for breach of quiet enjoyment and derogation from grant, which were to be tried with the assistance of expert evidence.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Frustration of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the parties claimed that extraordinary and unforeseen events (social unrest and pandemic in precedent p; power surge and market collapse in current case c) rendered the performance of the contract radically different from what was originally contemplated.

- **Legal Concept 2: Time of the Essence**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: Both cases involved contracts where time was explicitly stated to be of the essence (Tenancy Agreements in precedent p; delivery date in current case c).

- **Legal Concept 3: Breach and Remedies**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In both cases, the parties sought remedies for breach of contract (rent abatement and counterclaims in precedent p; refusal to perform and potential damages in current case c).

- **Legal Concept 4: Allocation of Risk**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: Both cases involved the allocation of risk for unforeseen events and the impact on the contractual obligations (risk of social unrest and pandemic in precedent p; risk of power surge and market collapse in current case c).

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR")

This suggests a general rule that when we see **fact pattern i*** (extraordinary and unforeseen events that significantly impact the performance of the contract but do not render it radically different), the court should decide **outcome o** (the contract is not frustrated, but parties may seek other remedies such as abatement or damages). This rule was justified in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" because the positive effects (E+) of maintaining contractual stability and predictability outweighed the negative effects (E-) of the unforeseen events on the parties' expectations.

Applying this rule to the current case, Real Plastic can argue that the contracts with Knock-Out and Copy Dog are not frustrated by the power surge and market collapse. However, Real Plastic may seek remedies for breach of contract, such as damages for the costs incurred in preparing to perform the contracts. Knock-Out and Copy Dog do not have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations based on the doctrine of frustration.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR") are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Frustration of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the parties claimed that extraordinary and unforeseen events (social unrest and pandemic in precedent; power surge and market collapse in current case) rendered the performance of the contract radically different from what was originally contemplated.

- **Legal Concept 2: Time of the Essence**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: Both cases involved contracts where time was explicitly stated to be of the essence (Tenancy Agreements in precedent; delivery date in current case).

- **Legal Concept 3: Breach and Remedies**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In both cases, the parties sought remedies for breach of contract (rent abatement and counterclaims in precedent; refusal to perform and potential damages in current case).

- **Legal Concept 4: Allocation of Risk**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: Both cases involved the allocation of risk for unforeseen events and the impact on the contractual obligations (risk of social unrest and pandemic in precedent; risk of power surge and market collapse in current case).

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome: the contracts are not frustrated, but parties may seek other remedies such as damages for breach of contract.

This decision would be justified because, as in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR", it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Contractual Stability and Predictability**: Upholding the contracts despite unforeseen events ensures that parties can rely on the terms they agreed upon, promoting stability and predictability in commercial transactions.

2. **Risk Allocation**: The parties are deemed to have allocated the risk of unforeseen events when they entered into the contract. Allowing frustration in these circumstances would undermine the principle that parties should bear the risks they have implicitly or explicitly agreed to.

3. **Encouragement of Mitigation**: By not allowing frustration, parties are encouraged to find ways to mitigate the impact of unforeseen events, such as negotiating new terms or seeking alternative solutions, rather than simply abandoning their contractual obligations.

4. **Economic Efficiency**: Maintaining the enforceability of contracts promotes economic efficiency by ensuring that resources are allocated according to the agreed terms, rather than being disrupted by unforeseen events.

Therefore, Real Plastic can argue that Knock-Out and Copy Dog do not have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations based on the doctrine of frustration. Real Plastic may seek remedies for breach of contract, such as damages for the costs incurred in preparing to perform the contracts. This approach aligns with the principles established in the precedent case and supports the underlying values of contractual stability, risk allocation, mitigation, and economic efficiency.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR", the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of a specific abatement clause in the tenancy agreement. This abatement clause was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling (allowing the tenant to argue for rent abatement and counterclaims) outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided a clear mechanism for addressing the impact of unforeseen events on the tenant's obligations. However, in our current case, this crucial abatement clause is notably absent as there is no similar provision in the contract between Real Plastic and Knock-Out or Copy Dog that explicitly addresses the impact of unforeseen events on the delivery obligations.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the clerical error that recorded the new date of delivery as 9 April, which was not present in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR". This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces an element of ambiguity and potential miscommunication regarding the agreed delivery date. Due to this clerical error, applying the same outcome (that the contracts are not frustrated) in our case would have more negative consequences such as increased uncertainty and potential disputes over the correct delivery date than positive ones, unlike in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" because the precedent case did not involve any such clerical errors that could complicate the interpretation of the contractual obligations.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" should be stated as "When both [extraordinary and unforeseen events that significantly impact the performance of the contract but do not render it radically different] and [the presence of a specific abatement clause or similar provision] are present, the court should decide [the contract is not frustrated, but parties may seek other remedies such as abatement or damages]." Omitting [the presence of a specific abatement clause or similar provision] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q], which is increased uncertainty and potential disputes over the correct interpretation of the contractual obligations in the absence of clear guidance on how to handle unforeseen events. Indeed, the opinion in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" explicitly states that the abatement clause was crucial to their decision, as it provided a mechanism for addressing the impact of unforeseen events on the tenant's obligations.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" was clearly designed to prevent [undesirable consequence u], which is the unfair imposition of contractual obligations on a party when unforeseen events significantly impact their ability to perform, without any mechanism to address such impacts. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [u] occurring because the contracts between Real Plastic and Knock-Out or Copy Dog do not contain a specific abatement clause or similar provision that would provide a mechanism for addressing the impact of unforeseen events. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should consider the absence of such a clause and the clerical error in determining the appropriate remedy, which may include damages for breach of contract rather than frustration.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the specific abatement clause, which was present in the precedent case WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR", requiring this factor for all similar cases of extraordinary and unforeseen events that significantly impact the performance of the contract but do not render it radically different would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would create a rigid requirement that could prevent courts from considering the broader context and the parties' intentions in situations where unforeseen events impact contractual performance. Conversely, not requiring the presence of an abatement clause would allow for a more flexible and equitable approach, enabling courts to address the unique circumstances of each case and provide appropriate remedies. This approach better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which include fairness, the intention of the parties, and the need to adapt to unforeseen changes in circumstances.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the specific abatement clause, which was present in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR", we have the additional factor of the clerical error that recorded the new date of delivery as 9 April. This clerical error, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of extraordinary and unforeseen events impacting the performance of the contract, serves a similar function to the abatement clause in the precedent case. The clerical error introduces an element of ambiguity and potential miscommunication regarding the agreed delivery date, which necessitates a careful consideration of the parties' intentions and the impact of the unforeseen events. Given the presence of this clerical error, we submit that the reasoning in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" still applies, as the positive effects on contractual stability, risk allocation, and fairness would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. Therefore, Real Plastic can argue that Knock-Out and Copy Dog do not have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations based on the doctrine of frustration, and Real Plastic may seek remedies for breach of contract, such as damages for the costs incurred in preparing to perform the contracts.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR", the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of extraordinary and unforeseen events that significantly impact the performance of the contract but do not render it radically different, and the explicit stipulation that time is of the essence. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of a specific abatement clause in the current case and the presence of a clerical error regarding the delivery date.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case, which suggests that contracts are not frustrated by unforeseen events but parties may seek other remedies such as abatement or damages, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the absence of an abatement clause and the clerical error in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the absence of an abatement clause and the clerical error introduce ambiguity and potential miscommunication, which necessitates a careful consideration of the parties' intentions and the impact of the unforeseen events. On the other hand, the argument that maintaining contractual stability, risk allocation, and fairness should still prevail, as in the precedent case, is also compelling.

Considering the underlying legal principles of contractual stability, risk allocation, and fairness, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Real Plastic can argue that Knock-Out and Copy Dog do not have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations based on the doctrine of frustration. The contracts are not frustrated by the unforeseen events, but Real Plastic may seek remedies for breach of contract, such as damages for the costs incurred in preparing to perform the contracts. This decision aligns with the principles established in the precedent case while also taking into account the unique circumstances of the current case, including the clerical error and the absence of an abatement clause.

   - The fact that the buyer has set up the breach of warranty in diminution or extinction of the price does not prevent him from maintaining an action for the same breach of warranty if he has suffered further damage.

   Exceptions:
   - None

4. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsections 1-2

   Conditions:
   - A contract governed by law applicable to the Colony has become impossible of performance or been otherwise frustrated.

   Exceptions:
   - The party to whom the sums were so paid or payable incurred expenses before the time of discharge in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, the court may, if it considers it just to do so having regard to all the circumstances of the case, allow him to retain or, as the case may be, recover the whole or any part of the sums so paid or payable, not being an amount in excess of the expenses so incurred.

### Minor Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 52 Subsections 1-3:
- Knock-Out and Copy Dog have both refused to accept and pay for the synthetic leather.
- Real Plastic can maintain an action against Knock-Out and Copy Dog for damages for non-acceptance.
- The market price of synthetic leather on 11 April was $12 per meter, which is lower than the contract price of $20 per meter.
- Therefore, the measure of damages is the difference between the contract price ($20) and the market price ($12) at the time of the refusal to accept, which is $8 per meter.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsections 1-2:
- The contracts have not become impossible of performance or been otherwise frustrated.
- The parties have not been discharged from the further performance of the contract due to frustration.
- Therefore, this section does not apply.

### Conclusion:

Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 52 Subsections 1-3 applies. Real Plastic can claim damages for breach of contract from Knock-Out and Copy Dog. The measure of damages is the difference between the contract price ($20 per meter) and the market price ($12 per meter) at the time of the refusal to accept, which is $8 per meter.

### Major Premise:

1. Ocean Force Enterprises Limited v Chun Sau Wan

   Conditions:
   - The parties to a contract stipulate a time by which they are to perform and time is of the essence.
   - One of the parties fails to abide by that stipulated time.

   Consequences:

   - The contract between Knock-Out and Real Plastic stipulated that time was of the essence.
   - Real Plastic informed Knock-Out on 15 March that it would not be able to fulfil its contractual undertakings by the stipulated time of 12 April.
   - Knock-Out agreed to a new delivery date of 19 April in exchange for a 10% discount, effectively waiving the original time stipulation.
   - Therefore, the exception of waiver applies, and Knock-Out cannot claim repudiatory breach based on the original delivery date.

2. Copy Dog and Real Plastic:
   - The contract between Copy Dog and Real Plastic stipulated that time was of the essence.
   - Real Plastic informed Copy Dog on 15 March that it would not be able to fulfil its contractual undertakings by the stipulated time of 12 April.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA 136/2017 BETWEEN ZHAOQING KIDSTAR FOODS LIMITED. Plaintiff and UTILITY INDUSTRIAL LIMITED Defendant)
In the case of HCA 136/2017 BETWEEN ZHAOQING KIDSTAR FOODS LIMITED. Plaintiff and UTILITY INDUSTRIAL LIMITED Defendant (precedent p), the plaintiff, Zhaoqing Kidstar Foods Limited, entered into a contract with the defendant, Utility Industrial Limited, for the supply of goods. The defendant failed to deliver the goods as agreed, leading to a breach of contract. The court ruled that the defendant was liable for damages, including the difference in price for sourcing substitute goods and other consequential losses. The court awarded the plaintiff the liquidated sum paid for the undelivered goods, damages for the price difference in sourcing substitute goods, and costs.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA 136/2017 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Breach of Contract**: In both cases, the defendants failed to deliver goods as per the contractual terms.
  - **Fact Pattern**: In HCA 136/2017, Utility Industrial Limited did not deliver the TS Sugar as agreed. In the current case, Real Plastic informed Knock-Out and Copy Dog that it could not fulfill the orders on time.
  
- **Anticipatory Breach**: The defendants in both cases indicated in advance that they would not be able to fulfill their contractual obligations.
  - **Fact Pattern**: In HCA 136/2017, Utility Industrial Limited notified the plaintiff that it would not deliver the goods due to a rise in market price. In the current case, Real Plastic informed both Knock-Out and Copy Dog that it could not meet the delivery date due to a power surge at its plant.
  
- **Mitigation of Damages**: The plaintiffs in both cases took steps to mitigate their losses by sourcing substitute goods.
  - **Fact Pattern**: In HCA 136/2017, Zhaoqing Kidstar Foods Limited sourced TS Sugar from another supplier. In the current case, Knock-Out and Copy Dog had the option to accept delayed delivery with a discount or seek alternative suppliers.
  
- **Measure of Damages**: The court in both cases considered the difference in price between the contract price and the market price at the time of breach.
  - **Fact Pattern**: In HCA 136/2017, the court awarded damages based on the price difference for sourcing substitute goods. In the current case, the market price of synthetic leather increased, and Real Plastic could claim damages based on the difference between the contract price and the market price.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA 136/2017)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a breach of contract involving non-delivery of goods and an anticipatory breach, the court should decide to award damages based on the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of breach, along with any consequential losses. This rule was justified in HCA 136/2017 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that the non-breaching party is compensated for their losses and placed in the same position as if the contract had been performed outweigh the negative effects (E-) of holding the breaching party liable for the increased costs and consequential damages. This promotes fairness and upholds the principle of pacta sunt servanda (agreements must be kept) in contract law.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA 136/2017 BETWEEN ZHAOQING KIDSTAR FOODS LIMITED. Plaintiff and UTILITY INDUSTRIAL LIMITED Defendant) are present:

- **Breach of Contract**: In both cases, the defendants failed to deliver goods as per the contractual terms.
  - **Fact Pattern**: In HCA 136/2017, Utility Industrial Limited did not deliver the TS Sugar as agreed. In the current case, Real Plastic informed Knock-Out and Copy Dog that it could not fulfill the orders on time.

- **Anticipatory Breach**: The defendants in both cases indicated in advance that they would not be able to fulfill their contractual obligations.
  - **Fact Pattern**: In HCA 136/2017, Utility Industrial Limited notified the plaintiff that it would not deliver the goods due to a rise in market price. In the current case, Real Plastic informed both Knock-Out and Copy Dog that it could not meet the delivery date due to a power surge at its plant.

- **Mitigation of Damages**: The plaintiffs in both cases took steps to mitigate their losses by sourcing substitute goods.
  - **Fact Pattern**: In HCA 136/2017, Zhaoqing Kidstar Foods Limited sourced TS Sugar from another supplier. In the current case, Knock-Out and Copy Dog had the option to accept delayed delivery with a discount or seek alternative suppliers.

- **Measure of Damages**: The court in both cases considered the difference in price between the contract price and the market price at the time of breach.
  - **Fact Pattern**: In HCA 136/2017, the court awarded damages based on the price difference for sourcing substitute goods. In the current case, the market price of synthetic leather increased, and Real Plastic could claim damages based on the difference between the contract price and the market price.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome: awarding damages based on the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of breach, along with any consequential losses.

This decision would be justified because, as in HCA 136/2017, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Compensation for Pecuniary Loss**: Ensuring that Real Plastic is compensated for their losses and placed in the same position as if the contract had been performed upholds the principle of pacta sunt servanda (agreements must be kept) in contract law.
2. **Encouragement of Contractual Compliance**: Holding Knock-Out and Copy Dog liable for the increased costs and consequential damages promotes fairness and encourages parties to honor their contractual commitments.
3. **Mitigation of Losses**: Recognizing the efforts of Real Plastic to mitigate its losses by ramping up production and offering discounts aligns with the duty to mitigate damages, ensuring that parties take reasonable steps to reduce their losses.

Therefore, Real Plastic should be entitled to claim damages for breach of contract from Knock-Out and Copy Dog, including the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of breach, as well as any consequential losses incurred.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the sudden and drastic change in market conditions due to the airing of "The Next Big Thing" on television, which was not present in HCA 136/2017 BETWEEN ZHAOQING KIDSTAR FOODS LIMITED. Plaintiff and UTILITY INDUSTRIAL LIMITED Defendant. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of anticipatory breach and mitigation of damages.

Because of this sudden market change, the price of synthetic crocodile leather plummeted to $12 per meter, which is significantly lower than the original contract price of $20 per meter. This drastic change in market conditions means that the damages Real Plastic might claim based on the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of breach would be significantly reduced, if not negated. 

Due to this factor, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as unfairly penalizing Knock-Out and Copy Dog for a market fluctuation that was beyond their control, unlike in HCA 136/2017. In the precedent case, the market conditions remained relatively stable, and the plaintiff's actions to mitigate their losses were straightforward and reasonable. However, in our current case, the sudden market change introduces a new dynamic that significantly impacts the assessment of damages and the fairness of holding Knock-Out and Copy Dog liable for the original contract price.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA 136/2017 BETWEEN ZHAOQING KIDSTAR FOODS LIMITED. Plaintiff and UTILITY INDUSTRIAL LIMITED Defendant should be stated as: "When both a breach of contract involving non-delivery of goods and an anticipatory breach are present, and there is no sudden and drastic change in market conditions, the court should decide to award damages based on the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of breach, along with any consequential losses." Omitting the sudden and drastic change in market conditions from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of unfairly penalizing the non-breaching party for market fluctuations beyond their control. Indeed, the opinion in HCA 136/2017 explicitly states that the market conditions remained relatively stable, which was crucial to their decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA 136/2017 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of leaving the non-breaching party uncompensated for their losses due to a breach of contract. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because the sudden and drastic change in market conditions (due to the airing of "The Next Big Thing") significantly impacts the assessment of damages. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The sudden market change introduces a new dynamic that significantly impacts the fairness of holding Knock-Out and Copy Dog liable for the original contract price, thus necessitating a different approach to the assessment of damages.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of a stable market condition, which was present in the precedent case HCA 136/2017 BETWEEN ZHAOQING KIDSTAR FOODS LIMITED. Plaintiff and UTILITY INDUSTRIAL LIMITED Defendant, requiring this factor for all similar cases of anticipatory breach and mitigation of damages would lead to the undesirable consequence of unfairly penalizing parties for market fluctuations beyond their control. Conversely, not requiring stable market conditions would allow for a more equitable assessment of damages that takes into account the actual market dynamics at the time of breach. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which aim to fairly compensate the non-breaching party for their actual losses while also considering the duty to mitigate damages.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of stable market conditions, which was present in HCA 136/2017, we have the additional factor of a sudden and drastic change in market conditions due to the airing of "The Next Big Thing." This sudden market change, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of anticipatory breach and mitigation of damages, serves a similar function to stable market conditions in the precedent case. Given the presence of this sudden market change, we submit that the reasoning in HCA 136/2017 still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as fairness and equitable compensation would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. This approach ensures that the non-breaching party is fairly compensated for their actual losses while also recognizing the impact of unforeseen market dynamics.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA 136/2017 BETWEEN ZHAOQING KIDSTAR FOODS LIMITED. Plaintiff and UTILITY INDUSTRIAL LIMITED Defendant, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the breach of contract involving non-delivery of goods, anticipatory breach, and the plaintiffs' efforts to mitigate damages by sourcing substitute goods. However, it also differs significantly due to the sudden and drastic change in market conditions caused by the airing of "The Next Big Thing," which led to a collapse in consumer demand for synthetic crocodile leather and a significant drop in its market price.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case, which suggests awarding damages based on the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of breach, along with any consequential losses, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the sudden market change in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the sudden market change significantly impacts the assessment of damages and the fairness of holding Knock-Out and Copy Dog liable for the original contract price. Conversely, the argument that the rule from the precedent case should still apply to ensure equitable compensation and uphold the principle of pacta sunt servanda also holds merit.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, equitable compensation, and the duty to mitigate damages, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Real Plastic should be entitled to claim damages for breach of contract from Knock-Out and Copy Dog. However, the assessment of damages should take into account the sudden and drastic change in market conditions. Therefore, the damages should be based on the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of breach, adjusted for the significant drop in market price due to the unforeseen market dynamics.

This decision ensures that Real Plastic is fairly compensated for its actual losses while also recognizing the impact of unforeseen market changes, thus aligning with legal precedent and serving justice and legal consistency.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (Konwall Construction & Engineering Co., Ltd. v Strong Progress Limited)

In the case of Konwall Construction & Engineering Co., Ltd. v Strong Progress Limited (precedent p), the court ruled that the Defendant had no legal basis to refuse delivery of the Subject Orders. The court rejected all the defences on liability raised by the Defendant, including the arguments for implied terms and the alleged unreasonableness of the Plaintiff's demands. The court also held that the Plaintiff was entitled to damages based on the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time the goods ought to have been delivered.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in Konwall Construction & Engineering Co., Ltd. v Strong Progress Limited and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Breach of Contract**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the Defendants failed to fulfil their contractual obligations by the agreed date.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Implied Terms and Reasonableness**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In both cases, the Defendants argued for the implication of terms that would excuse their non-performance, which the court rejected.
  
- **Legal Concept 3: Market Price and Damages**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In both cases, the market price of the goods in question changed significantly between the time of contract formation and the time of delivery, affecting the calculation of damages.
  
- **Legal Concept 4: Mitigation of Loss**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In both cases, the Plaintiffs were required to mitigate their losses, and the court examined whether they had done so reasonably.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (Konwall Construction & Engineering Co., Ltd. v Strong Progress Limited)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a breach of contract where the Defendant fails to deliver goods by the agreed date, and the Plaintiff has not agreed to any implied terms that would excuse the non-performance, the court should decide that the Defendant is liable for damages based on the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time the goods ought to have been delivered. This rule was justified in Konwall Construction & Engineering Co., Ltd. v Strong Progress Limited because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring contractual obligations are met and providing a clear basis for calculating damages outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially harsh outcomes for Defendants who fail to perform due to unforeseen circumstances. This upholds the underlying values of contractual certainty and fairness in commercial transactions.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (Konwall Construction & Engineering Co., Ltd. v Strong Progress Limited) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Breach of Contract**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: Real Plastic failed to fulfil its contractual obligations to deliver synthetic leather to Knock-Out and Copy Dog by the agreed date of 12 April.

- **Legal Concept 2: Implied Terms and Reasonableness**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: Real Plastic offered a 5% discount for delayed delivery, and Knock-Out agreed to a 10% discount for a later delivery date. However, there was no implied term that excused Real Plastic from its obligation to deliver on time.

- **Legal Concept 3: Market Price and Damages**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: The market price of synthetic crocodile leather increased to $24 per meter by the time of the original delivery date, and then plummeted to $12 per meter after the demand collapsed.

- **Legal Concept 4: Mitigation of Loss**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: Knock-Out and Copy Dog were required to mitigate their losses. Knock-Out agreed to a delayed delivery with a discount, while Copy Dog did not accept the delay and sought to maintain the original delivery date by offering a higher price.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in Konwall Construction & Engineering Co., Ltd. v Strong Progress Limited. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Contractual Obligations**: Enforcing the original terms of the contract ensures that parties are held accountable for their commitments, promoting reliability and trust in commercial transactions.

2. **Clear Basis for Calculating Damages**: By calculating damages based on the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time the goods ought to have been delivered, the court provides a straightforward and predictable method for assessing losses, which is crucial for commercial certainty.

3. **Encouraging Mitigation of Losses**: The requirement for the Plaintiffs to mitigate their losses ensures that they act reasonably to minimize the impact of the breach, which is fair to both parties and prevents unjust enrichment.

4. **Fairness in Commercial Transactions**: The decision balances the interests of both parties by ensuring that the non-breaching party is compensated for their losses while also considering the actions taken to mitigate those losses.

Therefore, Real Plastic should be entitled to claim damages from Knock-Out and Copy Dog based on the difference between the contract price ($20 per meter) and the market price at the time the goods ought to have been delivered ($24 per meter). This would result in damages of $4 per meter for the 200,000 meters ordered by each party, amounting to $800,000 from each party. Additionally, Real Plastic may also claim any other consequential losses incurred due to the breach, provided they are not too remote and were within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time of contract formation.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor of **market price fluctuation** that was not present in Konwall Construction & Engineering Co., Ltd. v Strong Progress Limited. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of **market price and damages** because the market price of synthetic crocodile leather plummeted to $12 per meter after the demand collapsed, which was not a consideration in the precedent case.

Due to this market price fluctuation, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as **unfair financial burden on Real Plastic** than positive ones, unlike in Konwall Construction & Engineering Co., Ltd. v Strong Progress Limited because the precedent case did not involve a sudden and drastic change in market conditions that would render the damages calculation based on the original market price inequitable. Therefore, the court should consider the unique market conditions in the current case when determining the appropriate remedy.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **Konwall Construction & Engineering Co., Ltd. v Strong Progress Limited** should be stated as "When both [i*] (breach of contract where the Defendant fails to deliver goods by the agreed date) and [m] (significant market price fluctuation) are present, the court should decide [o] (that the Defendant is liable for damages based on the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time the goods ought to have been delivered, but adjusted to account for the market price fluctuation)." Omitting [m] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q] (unfair financial burden on the Defendant due to drastic market changes that were not foreseeable at the time of contract formation). Indeed, the opinion in **Konwall Construction & Engineering Co., Ltd. v Strong Progress Limited** implicitly assumes a stable market condition, which was crucial to their decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **Konwall Construction & Engineering Co., Ltd. v Strong Progress Limited** was clearly designed to prevent [undesirable consequence u] (parties being able to escape their contractual obligations without a valid reason, thereby undermining the reliability of commercial contracts). However, in our current case, there's no risk of [u] occurring because both Knock-Out and Copy Dog initially sought to uphold their contractual obligations until the market conditions drastically changed. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The drastic market fluctuation is a unique factor that necessitates a different approach to ensure fairness and equity in the assessment of damages.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of **market price stability**, which was present in the precedent case **Konwall Construction & Engineering Co., Ltd. v Strong Progress Limited**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of **breach of contract where the Defendant fails to deliver goods by the agreed date** would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would unfairly penalize parties who are unable to foresee and mitigate drastic market fluctuations, thereby imposing an inequitable financial burden on them. Conversely, not requiring market price stability would allow for a more equitable assessment of damages that takes into account the unique market conditions at the time of breach. This better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and equity in contract law, ensuring that neither party is unduly disadvantaged by unforeseen market changes.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of **market price stability**, which was present in **Konwall Construction & Engineering Co., Ltd. v Strong Progress Limited**, we have the additional factor of **mitigation efforts by the Plaintiffs**. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of **breach of contract where the Defendant fails to deliver goods by the agreed date**, serves a similar function to market price stability in the precedent case. Given the presence of mitigation efforts by the Plaintiffs, we submit that the reasoning in **Konwall Construction & Engineering Co., Ltd. v Strong Progress Limited** still applies. The positive effects on legal values, such as upholding contractual obligations and ensuring fairness in commercial transactions, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. Therefore, Real Plastic should be entitled to claim damages from Knock-Out and Copy Dog based on the difference between the contract price and the adjusted market price, taking into account the mitigation efforts and the unique market conditions.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **Konwall Construction & Engineering Co., Ltd. v Strong Progress Limited**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the breach of contract where the Defendant fails to deliver goods by the agreed date, the arguments for implied terms and reasonableness, and the requirement for the Plaintiffs to mitigate their losses. However, it also differs significantly in the drastic market price fluctuation that occurred after the breach.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case, which holds that the Defendant is liable for damages based on the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time the goods ought to have been delivered, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the unique market conditions in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point from the initial analogy that upholding contractual obligations and providing a clear basis for calculating damages are crucial for commercial certainty. On the other hand, the rebuttal argument highlights the unfair financial burden on Real Plastic due to the unforeseen market price fluctuation, which was not a consideration in the precedent case.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, equity, and the need to uphold contractual obligations while also ensuring that neither party is unduly disadvantaged by unforeseen market changes, we conclude that Real Plastic should be entitled to claim damages from Knock-Out and Copy Dog. However, these damages should be adjusted to account for the unique market conditions and the mitigation efforts by the Plaintiffs.

Therefore, Real Plastic should be entitled to claim damages based on the difference between the contract price ($20 per meter) and the adjusted market price, taking into account the mitigation efforts and the unique market conditions. This approach ensures that the decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency.

In conclusion, Real Plastic can claim damages from Knock-Out and Copy Dog, but the damages should be calculated based on the adjusted market price at the time the goods ought to have been delivered, considering the drastic market price fluctuation and the Plaintiffs' mitigation efforts. This decision balances the need to uphold contractual obligations with the principles of fairness and equity in commercial transactions.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司)

In the case of CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司 [2022] HKCFI 2646; HCA 133/2021 (precedent p), the Plaintiff claimed damages against the Defendant for breach of a Restructuring Agreement. The Defendant failed to perform its obligations under the agreement, leading to the Plaintiff incurring professional fees and other costs. The court ruled that the Plaintiff was entitled to damages on a reliance loss basis, amounting to HK$7,228,270, as these costs were incurred in reliance on the Defendant's promised performance and were wasted due to the Defendant's breach.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Breach of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the Defendant failed to perform its contractual obligations, leading to a breach of contract.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Reliance Loss**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: The Plaintiff in both cases incurred expenses in reliance on the contract being performed. In the precedent case, these were professional fees; in the current case, it is the $5 million spent preparing to perform both contracts.
  
- **Legal Concept 3: Mitigation of Loss**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In both cases, the Plaintiff took steps to mitigate the loss caused by the Defendant's breach. In the precedent case, this involved efforts to continue the restructuring; in the current case, Knock-Out attempted to renegotiate the delivery terms.
  
- **Legal Concept 4: Damages Assessment**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: The court assessed damages based on the reliance loss principle, compensating the Plaintiff for the wasted expenses incurred due to the Defendant's breach.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a breach of contract where the Plaintiff has incurred reliance expenses, the court should decide to award damages to reimburse the Plaintiff for those expenses. This rule was justified in CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司 because the positive effects of compensating the Plaintiff for the wasted expenses (E+) on the underlying values and principles of the law, such as fairness and the protection of reliance interests, outweigh the negative effects (E-) in that case.

Applying this rule to the current case, Real Plastic should be entitled to claim restitution for the $5 million spent preparing to perform both contracts, as these expenses were incurred in reliance on the contracts being performed and were wasted due to the breach by Knock-Out and Copy Dog.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Breach of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: Real Plastic failed to perform its contractual obligations to deliver synthetic leather to Knock-Out and Copy Dog on the agreed date, leading to a breach of contract.

- **Legal Concept 2: Reliance Loss**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: Real Plastic incurred expenses amounting to $5 million in reliance on the contracts being performed. These expenses were spent preparing to fulfil both orders.

- **Legal Concept 3: Mitigation of Loss**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: Knock-Out attempted to renegotiate the delivery terms by agreeing to a delayed delivery in exchange for a discount, thereby taking steps to mitigate the loss caused by Real Plastic's breach.

- **Legal Concept 4: Damages Assessment**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: The court in the precedent case assessed damages based on the reliance loss principle, compensating the Plaintiff for the wasted expenses incurred due to the Defendant's breach. Similarly, Real Plastic seeks restitution for the $5 million spent preparing to perform both contracts.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome of awarding damages to reimburse Real Plastic for the $5 million spent in reliance on the contracts being performed. This decision would be justified because, as in CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Fairness**: Compensating Real Plastic for the wasted expenses ensures that the party who relied on the contract and incurred costs is not left to bear the financial burden of the breach. This aligns with the principle of fairness in contract law.

2. **Protection of Reliance Interests**: Awarding damages on a reliance loss basis protects the reliance interests of the non-breaching party, encouraging parties to enter into contracts with confidence that they will not be left uncompensated if the other party breaches.

3. **Encouragement of Contractual Performance**: By holding parties accountable for the costs incurred due to their breach, the court reinforces the importance of fulfilling contractual obligations, thereby promoting the stability and reliability of commercial transactions.

4. **Mitigation Efforts**: Recognizing the efforts made by Knock-Out to mitigate the loss by renegotiating the delivery terms further supports the principle that parties should take reasonable steps to minimize their losses, and such efforts should be acknowledged in the assessment of damages.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome of awarding damages to Real Plastic for the $5 million spent preparing to perform both contracts. This decision would be justified because, as in CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司, it would have the positive effects of ensuring fairness, protecting reliance interests, encouraging contractual performance, and recognizing mitigation efforts.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the Defendant had unequivocally breached the Restructuring Agreement by failing to perform its obligations, leading to the Plaintiff incurring professional fees and other costs. This clear breach of contract was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—compensating the Plaintiff for the wasted expenses—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it upheld the principle of fairness and protected the reliance interests of the non-breaching party.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of an unequivocal breach is notably absent. Knock-Out and Copy Dog have not yet unequivocally breached their contracts with Real Plastic. Instead, they have indicated their intention to consider themselves discharged from their respective contracts due to the collapse in consumer demand for synthetic crocodile leather. This introduces an element of uncertainty regarding whether a breach has actually occurred, as the contracts may be subject to frustration or other doctrines that could excuse performance.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—**the sudden and unforeseen collapse in consumer demand for synthetic crocodile leather**—that was not present in **CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of a straightforward breach of contract. Because of this collapse in demand, applying the same outcome of awarding reliance damages in our case would have more negative consequences, such as unfairly penalizing Knock-Out and Copy Dog for market conditions beyond their control, than positive ones. Unlike in **CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司**, where the breach was clear and unequivocal, the current market conditions introduce complexities that may justify excusing performance under doctrines like frustration or force majeure. Therefore, the presence of this market collapse factor in our case significantly alters the balance of positive and negative effects, making it inappropriate to apply the same outcome.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from **CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司** should be stated as: "When both [a clear and unequivocal breach of contract] and [the absence of market conditions that significantly alter the contractual landscape] are present, the court should decide [to award reliance damages to reimburse the claimant for expenses incurred in reliance on the contract being performed]." Omitting [the absence of market conditions that significantly alter the contractual landscape] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of unfairly penalizing parties for market conditions beyond their control, which could discourage commercial transactions and lead to unjust outcomes].

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in **CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of leaving a non-breaching party uncompensated for expenses incurred in reliance on a contract, thereby upholding fairness and protecting reliance interests]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [leaving Real Plastic uncompensated for expenses incurred in reliance on the contract] because the market conditions have significantly altered the contractual landscape, introducing complexities that may justify excusing performance under doctrines like frustration or force majeure. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the clear and unequivocal breach of contract, which was present in the precedent case **CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of reliance loss would lead to the undesirable consequence of potentially excusing parties from their contractual obligations due to unforeseen market conditions, thereby undermining the stability and predictability of commercial transactions. Conversely, not requiring a clear and unequivocal breach would allow for the desirable outcome of holding parties accountable for their contractual commitments, even in the face of market fluctuations, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, such as the sanctity of contracts and the protection of reliance interests.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the clear and unequivocal breach of contract, which was present in **CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司**, we have the additional factor of Knock-Out's and Copy Dog's actions indicating their intention to consider themselves discharged from their respective contracts due to the collapse in consumer demand. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of reliance loss and mitigation efforts, serves a similar function to the clear breach in the precedent case. Given the presence of this factor, we submit that the reasoning in **CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司** still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as fairness, the protection of reliance interests, and the encouragement of contractual performance, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in terms of the reliance loss incurred by the Plaintiff due to the Defendant's breach of contract. Both cases involve significant expenditures made in reliance on the contract being performed, and both involve efforts to mitigate the loss caused by the breach.

However, the current case differs in a crucial aspect: the sudden and unforeseen collapse in consumer demand for synthetic crocodile leather, which was not present in the precedent case. This market condition significantly alters the contractual landscape and introduces complexities that may justify excusing performance under doctrines like frustration or force majeure.

The proposed legal rule of awarding reliance damages to reimburse the claimant for expenses incurred in reliance on the contract being performed finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that compensating Real Plastic for the wasted expenses ensures fairness and protects reliance interests, against the counterargument that the market collapse introduces complexities that may justify excusing performance.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, the protection of reliance interests, and the encouragement of contractual performance, we conclude that Real Plastic should be entitled to claim restitution for the $5 million spent preparing to perform both contracts. This decision aligns with the precedent set in **CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司** and serves justice by ensuring that the party who relied on the contract and incurred costs is not left to bear the financial burden of the breach.

However, given the unique market conditions in the current case, the court should also consider whether doctrines like frustration or force majeure apply, which could potentially excuse Knock-Out and Copy Dog from their contractual obligations. If these doctrines do not apply, then Real Plastic should be awarded damages to reimburse the $5 million spent in reliance on the contracts being performed.

In conclusion, Real Plastic has a valid claim for restitution based on reliance loss, but the court must also evaluate the applicability of frustration or force majeure given the unforeseen market collapse. This balanced approach ensures legal consistency while also serving justice.


# Contract Law: Whether Real Plastic can claim reliance damages for the costs incurred in preparation for performance

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsections 2, 3, 4, and 5

### Major Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - A contract governed by law applicable to the Colony has become impossible of performance or been otherwise frustrated.
   - The parties thereto have for that reason been discharged from the further performance of the contract.

   Consequences:
   - All sums paid or payable to any party in pursuance of the contract before the time when the parties were so discharged shall, in the case of sums so paid, be recoverable from him as money received by him for the use of the party by whom the sums were paid.
   - In the case of sums so payable, cease to be so payable.

   Exceptions:
   - The party to whom the sums were so paid or payable incurred expenses before the time of discharge in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, the court may, if it considers it just to do so having regard to all the circumstances of the case, allow him to retain or, as the case may be, recover the whole or any part of the sums so paid or payable, not being an amount in excess of the expenses so incurred.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3

   Conditions:
   - Any party to the contract has, by reason of anything done by any other party thereto in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, obtained a valuable benefit (other than a payment of money to which subsection (2) applies) before the time of discharge.

   Consequences:
   - There shall be recoverable from him by the said other party such sum (if any), not exceeding the value of the said benefit to the party obtaining it, as the court considers just, having regard to all the circumstances of the case.

   Exceptions:
   - The amount of any expenses incurred before the time of discharge by the benefited party in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, including any sums paid or payable by him to any other party in pursuance of the contract and retained or recoverable by that party under subsection (2).
   - The effect, in relation to the said benefit, of the circumstances giving rise to the frustration of the contract.

3. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 4

   Conditions:
   - In estimating the amount of any expenses incurred by any party to the contract.

   Consequences:
   - The court may, without prejudice to the generality of the said subsections, include such sum as appears to be reasonable in respect of overhead expenses and in respect of any work or services performed personally by the said party.

   Exceptions:
   - None.

4. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 5

   Conditions:
   - Considering whether any sum ought to be recovered or retained under subsections (1), (2), (3) and (4) by any party to the contract.

   Consequences:
   - The court shall not take into account any sums which have, by reason of the circumstances giving rise to the frustration of the contract, become payable to that party under any contract of insurance.

   Exceptions:
   - There was an obligation to insure imposed by an express term of the frustrated contract or by or under any enactment.

### Minor Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2:
   - The contract between Knock-Out and Real Plastic has not become impossible of performance or been otherwise frustrated. The change in market demand does not constitute frustration.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3:
   - Knock-Out and Copy Dog have not obtained any valuable benefit from Real Plastic before the time of discharge.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

3. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 4:
   - This section is not applicable as it pertains to the estimation of expenses incurred by any party to the contract, which is not the issue at hand.

4. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 5:
   - This section is not applicable as it pertains to sums payable under any contract of insurance, which is not relevant to the current scenario.

### Conclusion:

Knock-Out and Copy Dog do not have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations based on the Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16. Real Plastic can claim reliance damages for the costs incurred in preparation for performance, as the contracts have not been frustrated. Real Plastic should seek to recover the $5 million spent in preparation for performance from Knock-Out and Copy Dog.

## Deductive Reasoning: ca

### Relevant law:

Redland Precast Concrete Products (China) Ltd v. Permasteelisa Hong Kong Ltd [2023] HKCA 1278

### Major Premise:

1. Redland Precast Concrete Products (China) Ltd v. Permasteelisa Hong Kong Ltd [2023] HKCA 1278

   Conditions:
   - The work carried out by the claimant was for the purpose of the tender analysis and due diligence carried out by the defendant, and for its objective of obtaining and securing the subcontract from the defendant.
   - The work was not requested by the defendant in contemplation of the subcontract being executed, nor in anticipation of the execution of the subcontract.
   - The claimant performed the work after being invited to submit its quotation to assist in the defendant’s evaluation of its bid.

   Consequences:
   - There is no implied agreement that the work carried out by the claimant should be paid on quantum meruit or any other basis.

   Exceptions:
   - The circumstances are such that the law should, as a matter of justice, impose upon the defendant an obligation to make payment of an amount which he deserved to be paid.

### Minor Premise:

1. Redland Precast Concrete Products (China) Ltd v. Permasteelisa Hong Kong Ltd [2023] HKCA 1278:
   - The work carried out by Real Plastic was not for the purpose of tender analysis or due diligence, but rather for fulfilling a direct order from Knock-Out and Copy Dog.
   - The work was requested by Knock-Out and Copy Dog in contemplation of the contracts being executed and in anticipation of the execution of the contracts.
   - Real Plastic performed the work after receiving confirmed orders from Knock-Out and Copy Dog, not merely to assist in an evaluation of a bid.

### Conclusion:

The conditions set out in Redland Precast Concrete Products (China) Ltd v. Permasteelisa Hong Kong Ltd [2023] HKCA 1278 do not apply to the scenario involving Real Plastic, Knock-Out, and Copy Dog. Therefore, the major premise does not provide a basis for determining whether Real Plastic can claim reliance damages for the costs incurred in preparation for performance.

### Additional Analysis:

Given that the major premise does not apply, we must consider general principles of contract law regarding breach and remedies.

1. **Breach of Contract**:
   - Both Knock-Out and Copy Dog had binding contracts with Real Plastic for the delivery of synthetic leather.
   - Knock-Out agreed to a revised delivery date of 19 April with a 10% discount, which was later mistakenly recorded as 9 April.
   - Copy Dog did not agree to any revised terms and expected delivery on 12 April.

2. **Repudiation**:
   - Knock-Out and Copy Dog both attempted to repudiate their contracts on 11 April, citing the collapse in demand for synthetic crocodile leather.
   - The repudiation by Knock-Out and Copy Dog is not justified as the contracts were still valid and enforceable.

3. **Remedies**:
   - Real Plastic can claim damages for breach of contract from both Knock-Out and Copy Dog.
   - The measure of damages would typically be the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of breach, plus any reliance damages for costs incurred in preparation for performance.

### Conclusion:

Real Plastic can claim damages for breach of contract from both Knock-Out and Copy Dog. The damages would include the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of breach, as well as reliance damages for the $5 million spent in preparation for performance.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司)

In the case of CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司 [2022] HKCFI 2646; HCA 133/2021 (precedent p), the Plaintiff claimed damages against the Defendant for breach of a Restructuring Agreement. The Defendant failed to perform its obligations under the agreement, leading to the Plaintiff incurring professional fees and other costs. The court ruled that the Plaintiff was entitled to damages on a reliance loss basis, amounting to HK$7,228,270, which included professional fees incurred in reliance on the contract being performed and costs incurred in mitigating the loss caused by the Defendant’s breach.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Breach of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the Defendant failed to perform its contractual obligations. In the precedent case, the Defendant failed to facilitate the restructuring and resumption as agreed. In the current case, Real Plastic failed to deliver the synthetic leather on time as stipulated in the contract.

- **Legal Concept 2: Reliance Damages**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: Both cases involve the Plaintiff incurring costs in reliance on the contract being performed. In the precedent case, the Plaintiff incurred professional fees for the restructuring. In the current case, Real Plastic incurred costs in preparing to fulfill the orders.

- **Legal Concept 3: Mitigation of Loss**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: Both cases involve efforts to mitigate the loss caused by the breach. In the precedent case, the Plaintiff incurred additional costs in trying to mitigate the loss. In the current case, Real Plastic offered discounts to mitigate the impact of the delayed delivery.

- **Legal Concept 4: Causation and Remoteness**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: The losses claimed are directly linked to the breach of contract and were within the reasonable contemplation of the parties. In the precedent case, the professional fees were a direct result of the Defendant’s breach. In the current case, the costs incurred by Real Plastic were a direct result of preparing to fulfill the orders.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a breach of contract leading to reliance expenditures and efforts to mitigate loss, the court should decide in favor of awarding reliance damages to the non-breaching party. This rule was justified in CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司 because the positive effects of awarding reliance damages—such as compensating the non-breaching party for costs incurred in good faith reliance on the contract and encouraging parties to uphold their contractual obligations—outweigh the negative effects. This approach ensures that the non-breaching party is placed in the same situation, as far as money can do it, as if the contract had been performed, thereby upholding the principles of fairness and justice in contract law.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Breach of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: Real Plastic failed to deliver the synthetic leather on time as stipulated in the contract with Knock-Out and Copy Dog, similar to how the Defendant in the precedent case failed to perform its obligations under the Restructuring Agreement.

- **Legal Concept 2: Reliance Damages**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: Real Plastic incurred costs in preparing to fulfill the orders, just as the Plaintiff in the precedent case incurred professional fees in reliance on the contract being performed.

- **Legal Concept 3: Mitigation of Loss**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: Real Plastic offered discounts to mitigate the impact of the delayed delivery, akin to the Plaintiff in the precedent case incurring additional costs in trying to mitigate the loss caused by the Defendant’s breach.

- **Legal Concept 4: Causation and Remoteness**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: The costs incurred by Real Plastic were a direct result of preparing to fulfill the orders and were within the reasonable contemplation of the parties, similar to the professional fees in the precedent case being a direct result of the Defendant’s breach.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome of awarding reliance damages to Real Plastic. This decision would be justified because, as in CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Compensation for Costs Incurred in Good Faith**: Awarding reliance damages would ensure that Real Plastic is compensated for the costs it incurred in good faith reliance on the contract being performed. This upholds the principle that parties should be placed in the same situation, as far as money can do it, as if the contract had been performed.

2. **Encouragement to Uphold Contractual Obligations**: This outcome would encourage parties to uphold their contractual obligations, knowing that failure to do so could result in them being liable for reliance damages. This promotes fairness and reliability in commercial transactions.

3. **Mitigation of Losses**: Recognizing the efforts made by Real Plastic to mitigate the losses caused by the breach (such as offering discounts) aligns with the legal principle that parties should take reasonable steps to mitigate their losses.

4. **Fairness and Justice**: Awarding reliance damages ensures that the non-breaching party is not left to bear the financial burden of the breach, thereby promoting fairness and justice in contract law.

Therefore, applying the rule from the precedent case to the current case, Real Plastic should be entitled to claim reliance damages for the costs incurred in preparation for performance, as well as any reasonable costs incurred in mitigating the loss caused by the breach.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the sudden and drastic change in market conditions for synthetic crocodile leather, that was not present in [CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司]. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of reliance damages and mitigation of loss.

In the precedent case, the market conditions and the value of the subject matter (professional fees and restructuring costs) remained stable and were not subject to sudden market fluctuations. The damages were straightforwardly linked to the breach of contract and the reliance expenditures incurred.

However, in our current case, the market price of synthetic crocodile leather plummeted from $24 per meter to $12 per meter due to an unforeseen change in consumer demand. This drastic change in market conditions introduces a new layer of complexity that was not present in the precedent case. The sudden drop in market value significantly impacts the reliance damages that Real Plastic might claim, as the market conditions directly affect the potential profitability and the commercial viability of the contracts with Knock-Out and Copy Dog.

Due to this significant market fluctuation, applying the same outcome of awarding reliance damages in our case would have more negative consequences, such as overcompensating Real Plastic for losses that are not solely attributable to the breach of contract but also to the drastic change in market conditions. This would unfairly burden Knock-Out and Copy Dog with losses that are beyond their control and not within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time of contracting.

Therefore, the presence of this market fluctuation factor in our current case significantly alters the balance of positive and negative effects, making it inappropriate to apply the same outcome as in the precedent case.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from [CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司] should be stated as 'When both [i*] (breach of contract leading to reliance expenditures and efforts to mitigate loss) and [m] (stable market conditions for the subject matter of the contract) are present, the court should decide [o] (to award reliance damages to the non-breaching party).' Omitting [m] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q] (overcompensating the non-breaching party for losses that are not solely attributable to the breach of contract but also to drastic changes in market conditions). Indeed, the opinion in [CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司] explicitly states that the professional fees and other costs were directly linked to the breach of contract and were within the reasonable contemplation of the parties, which implies stable market conditions were crucial to their decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in [CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司] was clearly designed to prevent [undesirable consequence u] (leaving the non-breaching party uncompensated for costs incurred in good faith reliance on the contract being performed). However, in our current case, there's no risk of [u] occurring because the drastic change in market conditions for synthetic crocodile leather significantly impacts the potential profitability and commercial viability of the contracts. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The sudden market fluctuation introduces a new layer of complexity that was not present in the precedent case, making it inappropriate to apply the same outcome of awarding reliance damages.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the stable market conditions (factor m) that were present in the precedent case [CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司], requiring this factor for all similar cases of breach of contract leading to reliance expenditures and efforts to mitigate loss (fact pattern i*) would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would mean that any sudden market fluctuation could unfairly absolve a breaching party from liability for reliance damages, even when the non-breaching party has incurred significant costs in good faith reliance on the contract. Conversely, not requiring stable market conditions would allow for a more equitable outcome, ensuring that non-breaching parties are compensated for their reliance expenditures, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and justice in contract law. This approach ensures that parties are held accountable for their contractual obligations, regardless of external market conditions, thereby promoting reliability and trust in commercial transactions.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the stable market conditions (factor m) that were present in [CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司], we have the additional factor of Real Plastic's efforts to mitigate the loss by offering discounts and attempting to negotiate new delivery terms (factor n). This factor n, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of breach of contract leading to reliance expenditures and efforts to mitigate loss (fact pattern i*), serves a similar function to stable market conditions in the precedent case. Given the presence of factor n, we submit that the reasoning in [CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司] still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as fairness, accountability, and compensation for good faith reliance would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. This ensures that Real Plastic is compensated for the costs incurred in preparation for performance and efforts to mitigate the loss, thereby upholding the principles of fairness and justice in contract law.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to [CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司], the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the breach of contract leading to reliance expenditures and efforts to mitigate loss. However, it also differs significantly due to the sudden and drastic change in market conditions for synthetic crocodile leather, which was not present in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule of awarding reliance damages to the non-breaching party finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the argument that stable market conditions were crucial in the precedent case and the counterargument that Real Plastic's efforts to mitigate the loss should be considered similarly.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, accountability, and compensation for good faith reliance, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Real Plastic should be entitled to claim reliance damages for the costs incurred in preparation for performance, as well as any reasonable costs incurred in mitigating the loss caused by the breach. This decision aligns with the principles of fairness and justice in contract law, ensuring that parties are held accountable for their contractual obligations, regardless of external market conditions.

Therefore, Real Plastic can claim reliance damages from Knock-Out and Copy Dog, as the costs incurred were in good faith reliance on the contract being performed, and efforts to mitigate the loss were reasonable and within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time of contracting. This approach ensures that the non-breaching party is compensated for its reliance expenditures, promoting reliability and trust in commercial transactions.

- A breach of contract occurred when Real Plastic informed Knock-Out and Copy Dog that it would not be able to fulfil its contractual undertakings.
- The loss claimed (the difference in market price of synthetic leather and potential lost profits) is within the parties’ reasonable contemplation under the rule in Hadley v Baxendale, as it is foreseeable that a delay or failure in delivery would affect the market price and potential profits.
- The loss is of a type for which Real Plastic could reasonably be regarded as having assumed contractual responsibility, given that time was of the essence in both contracts.

   Exceptions:
   - Real Plastic did not assume responsibility for such losses: This exception does not apply as Real Plastic agreed to the terms where time was of the essence.
   - The loss is too remote: This exception does not apply as the loss in market price and potential profits is a direct consequence of the breach and was foreseeable.

### Conclusion:

Richly Bright International Limited v De Monsa Investments Limited applies, and Real Plastic can claim expectation damages for the loss of profit from the contracts with Knock-Out and Copy Dog. Knock-Out and Copy Dog do not have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI v RICH PROSPER LIMITED)
In the case of HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI (張潔麗) 1st Plaintiff PAU WAI LAM (鮑惠林) 2nd Plaintiff And RICH PROSPER LIMITED (榮殷財務有限公司) 1st Defendant YEUNG TING CHEUNG (楊丁祥) 2nd Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the 1st Defendant could not imply a condition precedent to protect itself from a business loss due to its failure to exercise due diligence. The court emphasized that it is not the court's role to rewrite the contract for the parties or to imply terms that were not expressly agreed upon. The court also held that the contract was not frustrated despite the long delay caused by a third party (the DLO) because the delay did not render the performance of the contract impossible or radically different from what was originally contemplated.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Implied Terms and Business Risk**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA 972/2011, the 1st Defendant failed to exercise due diligence and sought to imply a condition precedent to avoid a business loss. Similarly, in our current case, Knock-Out and Copy Dog might argue that the change in market conditions (price drop of synthetic leather) should excuse them from their contractual obligations.
- **Legal Concept 2: Frustration of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA 972/2011, the court held that the contract was not frustrated despite a significant delay caused by a third party. In our current case, Knock-Out and Copy Dog might argue that the sudden drop in demand for crocodile skin due to a change in fashion trends frustrates the contract.
- **Legal Concept 3: Time of the Essence**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA 972/2011, the court emphasized the importance of adhering to the agreed completion date. In our current case, the contracts with Real Plastic stipulated that time was of the essence for the delivery of synthetic leather.
- **Legal Concept 4: Remedies for Breach of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCA 972/2011, the court considered the remedies available for breach of contract. In our current case, Real Plastic seeks to understand the remedies available for Knock-Out and Copy Dog's refusal to perform their contractual obligations.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a party failing to exercise due diligence and seeking to imply terms to avoid a business loss, or claiming frustration due to changes in market conditions, the court should decide against implying such terms or finding frustration. This rule was justified in HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI because the positive effects (E+) of upholding the sanctity of the contract and ensuring that parties bear the business risks they agreed to outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially harsh outcomes for the parties involved.

Applying this rule to our current case, Real Plastic can argue that Knock-Out and Copy Dog do not have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations. The change in market conditions (price drop of synthetic leather) does not constitute frustration, and the parties must adhere to the terms of the contract, including the stipulation that time is of the essence.

Real Plastic may seek the following remedies:
1. **Expectation Damages**: To cover the loss of profit from the contracts.
2. **Specific Performance**: To compel Knock-Out and Copy Dog to perform their contractual obligations, although this may be less likely given the change in market conditions.
3. **Damages for Breach of Contract**: To compensate for the costs incurred in preparing to perform the contracts.

In conclusion, based on the precedent set in HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI, Real Plastic has strong grounds to claim that Knock-Out and Copy Dog must fulfill their contractual obligations or compensate Real Plastic for their breach.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI v RICH PROSPER LIMITED) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Implied Terms and Business Risk**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA 972/2011, the 1st Defendant failed to exercise due diligence and sought to imply a condition precedent to avoid a business loss. Similarly, in our current case, Knock-Out and Copy Dog might argue that the change in market conditions (price drop of synthetic leather) should excuse them from their contractual obligations. However, the court in HCA 972/2011 held that it is not the court's role to imply terms that were not expressly agreed upon to protect a party from a business loss.

- **Legal Concept 2: Frustration of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA 972/2011, the court held that the contract was not frustrated despite a significant delay caused by a third party. In our current case, Knock-Out and Copy Dog might argue that the sudden drop in demand for crocodile skin due to a change in fashion trends frustrates the contract. However, the court in HCA 972/2011 emphasized that frustration only applies when performance becomes impossible or radically different from what was originally contemplated, not merely more difficult or less profitable.

- **Legal Concept 3: Time of the Essence**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA 972/2011, the court emphasized the importance of adhering to the agreed completion date. In our current case, the contracts with Real Plastic stipulated that time was of the essence for the delivery of synthetic leather. Real Plastic and Knock-Out agreed to a new delivery date of 9 April, which Knock-Out must adhere to.

- **Legal Concept 4: Remedies for Breach of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCA 972/2011, the court considered the remedies available for breach of contract. In our current case, Real Plastic seeks to understand the remedies available for Knock-Out and Copy Dog's refusal to perform their contractual obligations. The court in HCA 972/2011 awarded damages for breach of contract, which Real Plastic can similarly seek.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI v RICH PROSPER LIMITED. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would uphold the sanctity of the contract and ensure that parties bear the business risks they agreed to. The positive effects (E+) of enforcing the contractual obligations and not allowing parties to escape their commitments due to market fluctuations outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially harsh outcomes for the parties involved.

Real Plastic can argue that Knock-Out and Copy Dog do not have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations. The change in market conditions (price drop of synthetic leather) does not constitute frustration, and the parties must adhere to the terms of the contract, including the stipulation that time is of the essence.

Real Plastic may seek the following remedies:
1. **Expectation Damages**: To cover the loss of profit from the contracts.
2. **Specific Performance**: To compel Knock-Out and Copy Dog to perform their contractual obligations, although this may be less likely given the change in market conditions.
3. **Damages for Breach of Contract**: To compensate for the costs incurred in preparing to perform the contracts.

In conclusion, based on the precedent set in HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI, Real Plastic has strong grounds to claim that Knock-Out and Copy Dog must fulfill their contractual obligations or compensate Real Plastic for their breach. This decision would be justified because it would uphold the principles of contract law, ensuring that parties cannot escape their obligations due to unforeseen market changes, thereby promoting commercial certainty and fairness.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI v RICH PROSPER LIMITED, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the delay in performance was caused by a third party (the DLO) and not by the parties themselves. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—upholding the sanctity of the contract and ensuring that parties bear the business risks they agreed to—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it demonstrated that the delay was beyond the control of the contracting parties and did not fundamentally alter the nature of the contract.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as the delay or inability to perform is not due to a third party but rather due to Real Plastic's own operational issues (the power surge at its plant). This distinction is important because it shifts the responsibility for the delay directly onto Real Plastic, making it less justifiable to hold Knock-Out and Copy Dog to their original contractual obligations without considering the impact of Real Plastic's failure to manage its own risks.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—the sudden and drastic change in market conditions due to the shift in consumer demand from crocodile skin to leopard prints—that was not present in HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI v RICH PROSPER LIMITED. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces an element of market volatility that was not contemplated by the parties at the time of contracting.

Due to this market shift, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as forcing Knock-Out and Copy Dog to accept goods that have drastically decreased in value and are no longer in demand, leading to significant financial losses. Unlike in HCA 972/2011, where the delay did not fundamentally alter the nature of the contract, the change in market conditions in our case makes the performance of the contract radically different from what was originally contemplated. This distinction suggests that the contracts may be considered frustrated, as the core purpose of the agreements (to capitalize on the demand for crocodile skin) has been undermined by an unforeseen and significant change in market conditions.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI v RICH PROSPER LIMITED should be stated as "When both a party's failure to exercise due diligence and a significant delay caused by a third party are present, the court should decide against implying terms or finding frustration." Omitting the factor of a significant delay caused by a third party from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of parties being unfairly held to their contractual obligations despite unforeseen and uncontrollable events that fundamentally alter the nature of the contract. Indeed, the opinion in HCA 972/2011 explicitly states that the delay caused by the DLO was a crucial factor in the court's decision to not find frustration, as it was beyond the control of the contracting parties and did not fundamentally alter the nature of the contract.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI v RICH PROSPER LIMITED was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of parties escaping their contractual obligations due to their own lack of due diligence or ordinary business risks. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because the significant change in market conditions (the sudden drop in demand for crocodile skin due to a shift in fashion trends) was an unforeseen and uncontrollable event that fundamentally altered the nature of the contract. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—to ensure parties bear the business risks they agreed to—does not apply to a situation where the core purpose of the contract has been undermined by an extraordinary and unforeseen market shift.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of a significant delay caused by a third party, which was present in the precedent case HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI v RICH PROSPER LIMITED, requiring this factor for all similar cases of frustration of contract would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would mean that parties could only claim frustration if a third party caused the delay, thereby ignoring other significant and unforeseen events that could fundamentally alter the nature of the contract. Conversely, not requiring the factor of a third-party delay would allow for a more flexible and fair application of the frustration doctrine, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law. This approach ensures that contracts are only enforced when their performance remains within the reasonable expectations and assumptions of the parties at the time of contracting, thereby promoting fairness and commercial certainty.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of a significant delay caused by a third party, which was present in HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI v RICH PROSPER LIMITED, we have the additional factor of a sudden and drastic change in market conditions due to a shift in consumer demand. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of unforeseen events impacting the performance of the contract, serves a similar function to the third-party delay in the precedent case. Given the presence of this market shift, we submit that the reasoning in HCA 972/2011 still applies, as the positive effects on legal values—such as fairness, commercial certainty, and the reasonable expectations of the parties—would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. The sudden market change fundamentally alters the nature of the contract, making its performance radically different from what was originally contemplated, thereby justifying the application of the frustration doctrine.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA 972/2011 CHEUNG KIT LAI v RICH PROSPER LIMITED, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the importance of adhering to the agreed terms of the contract and the principle that parties should bear the business risks they agreed to. However, it also differs significantly in that the delay in performance in the current case is due to Real Plastic's own operational issues and not a third party, and there is a sudden and drastic change in market conditions due to a shift in consumer demand.

The proposed legal rule from HCA 972/2011—that the court should decide against implying terms or finding frustration when a party fails to exercise due diligence and seeks to avoid a business loss—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the unique circumstances of the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the change in market conditions does not constitute frustration as it does not render performance impossible or radically different from what was originally contemplated (as argued by Real Plastic). On the other hand, the counterargument that the sudden market shift fundamentally alters the nature of the contract and should be considered a frustrating event (as argued by Knock-Out and Copy Dog) is also compelling.

Considering the underlying legal principles of contract law, including the sanctity of contracts, the allocation of business risks, and the doctrine of frustration, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the contracts between Real Plastic and Knock-Out and Copy Dog have not been frustrated. The change in market conditions, while significant, does not meet the high threshold required for frustration, which typically involves an event that makes performance impossible or radically different from what was originally agreed upon.

Therefore, Knock-Out and Copy Dog do not have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations. Real Plastic is entitled to seek remedies for breach of contract, including:

1. **Expectation Damages**: To cover the loss of profit from the contracts.
2. **Specific Performance**: To compel Knock-Out and Copy Dog to perform their contractual obligations, although this may be less likely given the change in market conditions.
3. **Damages for Breach of Contract**: To compensate for the costs incurred in preparing to perform the contracts.

This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by upholding the principle that parties must adhere to their contractual obligations and bear the business risks they agreed to, even in the face of unforeseen market changes.
