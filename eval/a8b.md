1. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 5:
   - Nick and Tony have entered into a contract for the supply of wood and finishes.
   - Tony is acting in the course of his business.
   - Therefore, there is an implied term that Tony will carry out the service with reasonable care and skill.

2. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 6 Subsection 1:
   - The time for the service to be carried out is fixed by the contract.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

3. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 7 Subsection 1:
   - The consideration for the service is determined by the contract.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

4. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 8 Subsection 2:
   - A right, duty or liability would arise under the contract for the supply of a service by virtue of the Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance.
   - The contract is silent on the sourcing and paint/varnish requirements.
   - The implied term that Tony will carry out the service with reasonable care and skill may be negatived or varied by express agreement, or by the course of dealing between the parties, or by such usage as binds both parties to the contract.
   - There is no express agreement or course of dealing that negates the implied term of reasonable care and skill.
   - Therefore, the implied term that Tony will carry out the service with reasonable care and skill stands.

### Conclusion:

The Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 5 applies, and there is an implied term that Tony will carry out the service with reasonable care and skill. Given that Tony has failed to comply with Nick's environmental policies, Nick may have grounds to terminate the contract and seek damages for breach of this implied term.

## Deductive Reasoning: cfa

### Relevant law:

Kensland Realty Ltd v Whale View Investment Ltd

### Major Premise:

1. Kensland Realty Ltd v Whale View Investment Ltd

   Conditions:
   - The contract does not provide an express term regarding a specific obligation.
   - The term to be implied is necessary to give business efficacy to the contract.
   - The term is so obvious that it goes without saying.
   - The term is capable of clear expression.
   - The term does not contradict any express term of the contract.

   Consequences:
   - The court may imply a term into the contract.

   Exceptions:
   - The term contradicts an express term of the contract.

### Minor Premise:

1. Kensland Realty Ltd v Whale View Investment Ltd:
- The contract between Nick and Tony does not provide an express term regarding the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints used.
- The term that the wood must be locally sourced and the varnishes and paints must be plant-based is necessary to give business efficacy to the contract, as Nick's business depends on his reputation as an ethical builder.
- The term is so obvious that it goes without saying, given Nick's explicit emphasis on his environmental policies during discussions with Tony.
- The term is capable of clear expression: "All wood must be locally sourced, and all varnishes and paints must be plant-based."
- The term does not contradict any express term of the contract, as the contract is silent on these specific requirements.

### Conclusion:

The conditions for implying a term into the contract are satisfied, and none of the exceptions apply. Therefore, the court may imply a term into the contract that the wood must be locally sourced and the varnishes and paints must be plant-based. Nick may terminate the contract and seek potential damages for Tony's breach of the implied term.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (EGNER DAVID PARKS AND OTHERS v. CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LTD AND ANOTHER)

In the case of EGNER DAVID PARKS AND OTHERS v. CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LTD AND ANOTHER [2023] HKCFI 3126; HCA 247/2014 (precedent p), the court ruled on the interpretation of employment contracts and the implication of terms. The court held that the proper approach to construing the contractual provisions is to apply conventional contractual interpretation principles, taking into account the context and factual matrix, including the employment relationship. The court also discussed the conditions under which terms can be implied into a contract, emphasizing that a term will not be implied unless it is necessary to give business efficacy to the contract or it is so obvious that it goes without saying.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in EGNER DAVID PARKS AND OTHERS v. CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LTD AND ANOTHER and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Implied Terms by Necessity**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the parties entered into a contract that was silent on certain critical terms. In the precedent case, the contract was silent on specific aspects of promotion and remuneration. In the current case, the contract is silent on the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints to be used.

- **Legal Concept 2: Business Efficacy**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: The court in the precedent case considered whether the implied terms were necessary to give business efficacy to the contract. Similarly, in the current case, the implied terms regarding the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints are necessary to give business efficacy to Nick's eco home pod business, which relies on its reputation for using sustainable and renewable sources.

- **Legal Concept 3: Obviousness Test**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: The precedent case applied the obviousness test to determine if a term should be implied. In the current case, it is obvious that the terms regarding the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints should be implied, given Nick's explicit emphasis on these requirements during discussions with Tony.

- **Legal Concept 4: Context and Factual Matrix**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: The court in the precedent case took into account the context and factual matrix, including the employment relationship, when interpreting the contract. In the current case, the context and factual matrix include Nick's business model and his explicit communication to Tony about the importance of using locally sourced wood and plant-based varnishes and paints.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (EGNER DAVID PARKS AND OTHERS v. CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LTD AND ANOTHER)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a contract being silent on critical terms that are necessary for the business efficacy of the contract and are obvious given the context and factual matrix, the court should imply those terms. This rule was justified in EGNER DAVID PARKS AND OTHERS v. CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LTD AND ANOTHER because the positive effects of ensuring the contract's business efficacy and aligning with the parties' intentions outweighed any negative effects. The court's approach promotes fairness and ensures that the contract functions as intended by the parties, thereby upholding the underlying values and principles of contract law. 

Applying this rule to the current case, the court should imply the terms that the wood must be locally sourced and the varnishes and paints must be plant-based, as these terms are necessary for the business efficacy of Nick's eco home pod business and are obvious given the context and factual matrix of the agreement.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (EGNER DAVID PARKS AND OTHERS v. CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LTD AND ANOTHER) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Implied Terms by Necessity**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the parties entered into a contract that was silent on certain critical terms. In the precedent case, the contract was silent on specific aspects of promotion and remuneration. In the current case, the contract is silent on the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints to be used.

- **Legal Concept 2: Business Efficacy**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: The court in the precedent case considered whether the implied terms were necessary to give business efficacy to the contract. Similarly, in the current case, the implied terms regarding the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints are necessary to give business efficacy to Nick's eco home pod business, which relies on its reputation for using sustainable and renewable sources.

- **Legal Concept 3: Obviousness Test**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: The precedent case applied the obviousness test to determine if a term should be implied. In the current case, it is obvious that the terms regarding the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints should be implied, given Nick's explicit emphasis on these requirements during discussions with Tony.

- **Legal Concept 4: Context and Factual Matrix**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: The court in the precedent case took into account the context and factual matrix, including the employment relationship, when interpreting the contract. In the current case, the context and factual matrix include Nick's business model and his explicit communication to Tony about the importance of using locally sourced wood and plant-based varnishes and paints.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome of implying the terms that the wood must be locally sourced and the varnishes and paints must be plant-based. This decision would be justified because, as in EGNER DAVID PARKS AND OTHERS v. CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LTD AND ANOTHER, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Business Efficacy**: Implied terms are necessary to ensure that the contract functions as intended by the parties. Without these terms, Nick's business model, which is heavily reliant on its reputation for sustainability, would lack commercial coherence.

2. **Aligning with Parties' Intentions**: The implied terms reflect the clear intentions of the parties, as evidenced by Nick's explicit communication to Tony about the importance of using locally sourced wood and plant-based varnishes and paints.

3. **Promoting Fairness**: Imposing these implied terms ensures that Tony cannot undermine Nick's business model by deviating from the agreed-upon ethical standards, thereby promoting fairness in the contractual relationship.

4. **Upholding Contractual Integrity**: By implying these terms, the court would uphold the integrity of the contract, ensuring that both parties adhere to the fundamental principles that were the basis of their agreement.

Therefore, the court should imply the terms that the wood must be locally sourced and the varnishes and paints must be plant-based, as these terms are necessary for the business efficacy of Nick's eco home pod business and are obvious given the context and factual matrix of the agreement.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, namely the explicit communication and emphasis by Nick on the importance of using locally sourced wood and plant-based varnishes and paints, which was not present in the precedent case EGNER DAVID PARKS AND OTHERS v. CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LTD AND ANOTHER. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it provides clear evidence of the parties' intentions and the critical nature of these terms to the contract's business efficacy. Due to this explicit communication, applying the same outcome in our case would have more positive consequences, such as upholding the integrity of the contract and ensuring fairness, than negative ones, unlike in EGNER DAVID PARKS AND OTHERS v. CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LTD AND ANOTHER. This is because the explicit communication makes it obvious that the terms regarding the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints were essential to the agreement, thereby justifying their implication to give effect to the parties' intentions.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from EGNER DAVID PARKS AND OTHERS v. CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LTD AND ANOTHER should be stated as: "When both the contract is silent on critical terms necessary for business efficacy and there is explicit communication of these terms' importance, the court should imply those terms." Omitting the explicit communication from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of parties being able to undermine the clear intentions and critical business requirements communicated during negotiations, thereby causing unfairness and potentially damaging the business model reliant on those terms. Indeed, the opinion in EGNER DAVID PARKS AND OTHERS v. CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LTD AND ANOTHER explicitly states that the context and factual matrix, including the employment relationship, were crucial to their decision. This highlights the importance of considering the explicit communication and context in determining whether to imply terms.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in EGNER DAVID PARKS AND OTHERS v. CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LTD AND ANOTHER was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of contracts being interpreted in a way that does not reflect the parties' intentions and the necessary business efficacy. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because Nick explicitly communicated the importance of using locally sourced wood and plant-based varnishes and paints to Tony. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—to ensure contracts reflect the parties' intentions and business efficacy—is already addressed by the explicit communication in our case. Thus, the court should imply the terms that the wood must be locally sourced and the varnishes and paints must be plant-based to uphold the integrity and fairness of the contract.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction

While it's true that our case lacks the explicit employment relationship context (factor m), which was present in the precedent case EGNER DAVID PARKS AND OTHERS v. CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LTD AND ANOTHER, requiring this factor for all similar cases of implied terms in contracts would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would limit the application of implied terms to only employment contracts, thereby excluding other types of contracts where implied terms are equally necessary to ensure business efficacy and reflect the parties' intentions. Conversely, not requiring the employment relationship context would allow for a broader application of implied terms in various types of contracts, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, such as fairness, business efficacy, and the intention of the parties.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution

Although our case lacks the explicit employment relationship context (factor m), which was present in EGNER DAVID PARKS AND OTHERS v. CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LTD AND ANOTHER, we have the additional factor of explicit communication of critical terms (factor n). This explicit communication, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of the contract being silent on critical terms necessary for business efficacy, serves a similar function to the employment relationship context in the precedent case. Given the presence of explicit communication, we submit that the reasoning in EGNER DAVID PARKS AND OTHERS v. CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LTD AND ANOTHER still applies, as the positive effects on ensuring business efficacy, reflecting the parties' intentions, and promoting fairness would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to EGNER DAVID PARKS AND OTHERS v. CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LTD AND ANOTHER, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in the context of implied terms by necessity, business efficacy, the obviousness test, and the importance of context and factual matrix. However, it also differs in the explicit communication of critical terms by Nick, which was not present in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule of implying terms when the contract is silent on critical terms necessary for business efficacy and there is explicit communication of these terms' importance finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the necessity of implied terms to ensure business efficacy and reflect the parties' intentions (a strong point from the initial argument) and the potential limitation of applying implied terms only in employment contracts (a strong point from the rebuttal).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, business efficacy, and the intention of the parties, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the court should imply the terms that the wood must be locally sourced and the varnishes and paints must be plant-based. This decision is justified because it ensures the contract functions as intended by the parties, upholds the integrity and fairness of the contract, and aligns with the principles of contract law. The explicit communication by Nick about the importance of these terms further supports their implication, making it clear that these terms are essential to the agreement.

Therefore, Nick should be able to terminate the contract and recover potential damages due to Tony's failure to comply with the implied terms regarding the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints. This decision balances the need for legal consistency with the necessity of serving justice in the specific context of this case.


# Contract Law: Whether Tony's use of non-locally sourced wood and chemical-based varnishes and paints constitutes a breach of contract

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 33 Subsection 2  
Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 12 Subsections 1-4

### Major Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 33 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - There is a contract for the sale of goods to be delivered by stated instalments.
   - The seller makes defective deliveries in respect of one or more instalments.
   - The buyer neglects or refuses to take delivery of or pay for one or more instalments.

   Consequences:
   - It is a question in each case depending on the terms of the contract and the circumstances of the case, whether the breach of contract is a repudiation of the whole contract or whether it is a severable breach giving rise to a claim for compensation but not to a right to treat the whole contract as repudiated.

   Exceptions:
   - Unless otherwise agreed.

2. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 12 Subsections 1-4

   Conditions:
   - The possession or ownership of goods passes under or in pursuance of a contract not governed by the law of sale of goods.
   - The contract terms exclude or restrict liability for breach of obligation arising by implication of law from the nature of the contract.

   Consequences:
   - As against a person dealing as consumer, liability in respect of the goods’ correspondence with description or sample, or their quality or fitness for any particular purpose, cannot be excluded or restricted by reference to any such term.
   - As against a person dealing otherwise than as consumer, that liability can be excluded or restricted by reference to such a term, but only in so far as the term satisfies the requirement of reasonableness.
   - Liability in respect of the right to transfer ownership of the goods, or give possession; or the assurance of quiet possession to a person taking goods in pursuance of the contract, cannot be excluded or restricted by reference to any such term except in so far as the term satisfies the requirement of reasonableness.

   Exceptions:
   - None.

### Minor Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 33 Subsection 2:
   - Nick and Tony have a contract for the sale of wood to be delivered by stated instalments.
   - Tony has made defective deliveries by supplying non-locally sourced wood and using chemical-based varnishes and paints, contrary to Nick's requirements.
   - Nick wishes to terminate the contract and recover potential damages.

   - The contract is silent on the sourcing and paint/varnish requirements, but these were explicitly communicated and agreed upon verbally.
   - The breach of contract by Tony (using non-locally sourced wood and chemical-based finishes) is significant given Nick's business model and reputation.
   - Therefore, it is a question of whether this breach constitutes a repudiation of the whole contract or a severable breach.

2. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 12 Subsections 1-4:
   - The contract between Nick and Tony is governed by the law of sale of goods.
   - The contract does not explicitly exclude or restrict liability for breach of obligation arising by implication of law from the nature of the contract.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

### Conclusion:

Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 33 Subsection 2 applies. Given the significance of the breach to Nick's business model and reputation, it is likely that the court would consider Tony's actions as a repudiation of the whole contract. Nick would be entitled to terminate the contract and seek damages for the breach.

### Major Premise:

1. Leung Yuk Lin trading as King's Glory Educational Centre v Karson Oten Fan, Karno

   Conditions:
   - A term of a contract is an essential term, i.e., a condition
   - The term is breached

   Consequences:
   - The innocent party is entitled to accept the breach as repudiation and consider themselves discharged from further performance of the contract

   Exceptions:
   - The breach does not go to the root of the contract as to discharge the innocent party from further performance of the contract

### Minor Premise:

1. Leung Yuk Lin trading as King's Glory Educational Centre v Karson Oten Fan, Karno:
- Nick and Tony entered into a contract for the supply of wood.
- Nick explicitly communicated that the wood must be locally sourced and the varnishes and paints must be plant-based, which are essential terms for Nick's business reputation.
- The written contract, however, is silent on these specific requirements.
- Tony breached these essential terms by supplying non-locally sourced wood and using chemical-based varnishes and paints.
- The breach goes to the root of the contract because it directly affects Nick's business reputation and credibility in the eco home pod marketplace.

### Conclusion:

Leung Yuk Lin trading as King's Glory Educational Centre v Karson Oten Fan, Karno applies, and Nick is entitled to accept the breach as repudiation and consider himself discharged from further performance of the contract. Nick may also seek to recover potential damages resulting from Tony's breach.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCCT 40/2014)
In the case of HCCT 40/2014 (precedent p), the facts were as follows: A and B entered into a Development and Sales Agreement for the joint development, manufacture, distribution, and marketing of security and integrated circuit solutions. Disputes arose, leading to arbitration where B claimed A breached the Agreement. The Arbitrator ruled in favor of B, but A sought to set aside the award on the grounds that the Arbitrator failed to address a Limitation Defence. The court ruled that the Arbitrator's failure to address a central issue (the Limitation Defence) constituted a serious procedural irregularity, leading to the decision to remit the award back to the Arbitrator for reconsideration.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCCT 40/2014 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Breach of Contract**: In HCCT 40/2014, A was found to have breached the Agreement by failing to deliver products with the contractual features. In our current case, Tony breached the contract by supplying non-locally sourced wood and using chemical-based varnishes and paints.
- **Material Terms and Conditions**: In HCCT 40/2014, the Agreement included specific standards for the products. In our current case, although the contract is silent on sourcing and paint/varnish requirements, these were material terms discussed and agreed upon verbally.
- **Failure to Address Central Issues**: In HCCT 40/2014, the Arbitrator failed to address the Limitation Defence, a central issue. In our current case, the central issue is whether Tony's actions constitute a breach of the material terms discussed.
- **Remedies for Breach**: In HCCT 40/2014, the court considered setting aside the award due to procedural irregularity. In our current case, Nick seeks to terminate the contract and recover potential damages due to Tony's breach.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCCT 40/2014)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a failure to address or comply with material terms and conditions of a contract, the court should decide in favor of the aggrieved party seeking remedies for breach. This rule was justified in HCCT 40/2014 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring fairness, due process, and justice in arbitration proceedings outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially undermining the finality of arbitral awards. Similarly, in our current case, ensuring that Tony adheres to the material terms discussed with Nick (even if not explicitly written in the contract) upholds the principles of fairness and justice in contractual agreements.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCCT 40/2014) are present:

- **Breach of Contract**: In HCCT 40/2014, A was found to have breached the Agreement by failing to deliver products with the contractual features. In our current case, Tony breached the contract by supplying non-locally sourced wood and using chemical-based varnishes and paints.
- **Material Terms and Conditions**: In HCCT 40/2014, the Agreement included specific standards for the products. In our current case, although the contract is silent on sourcing and paint/varnish requirements, these were material terms discussed and agreed upon verbally.
- **Failure to Address Central Issues**: In HCCT 40/2014, the Arbitrator failed to address the Limitation Defence, a central issue. In our current case, the central issue is whether Tony's actions constitute a breach of the material terms discussed.
- **Remedies for Breach**: In HCCT 40/2014, the court considered setting aside the award due to procedural irregularity. In our current case, Nick seeks to terminate the contract and recover potential damages due to Tony's breach.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome: recognizing the breach of contract and allowing Nick to terminate the contract and seek damages. This decision would be justified because, as in HCCT 40/2014, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Fairness and Justice**: Ensuring that Tony adheres to the material terms discussed with Nick (even if not explicitly written in the contract) upholds the principles of fairness and justice in contractual agreements. This aligns with the court's emphasis on fairness and due process in HCCT 40/2014.
   
2. **Protecting Business Integrity**: Nick's business depends on his reputation as an ethical builder. Allowing Tony to deviate from the agreed-upon terms would undermine Nick's business integrity and credibility in the eco home pod marketplace. This is similar to the court's recognition in HCCT 40/2014 that failing to address central issues can lead to substantial injustice and unfairness.

3. **Encouraging Compliance with Verbal Agreements**: By ruling in favor of Nick, the court would reinforce the importance of compliance with verbal agreements, especially when they form the basis of the parties' understanding and expectations. This is consistent with the court's approach in HCCT 40/2014, where the failure to address a central issue was seen as a serious procedural irregularity.

4. **Deterring Misconduct**: A decision in favor of Nick would deter parties from disregarding material terms discussed during contract negotiations, even if those terms are not explicitly written in the contract. This promotes ethical business practices and accountability, similar to the court's emphasis on procedural integrity in HCCT 40/2014.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCCT 40/2014, it would have the positive effects of upholding fairness, protecting business integrity, encouraging compliance with verbal agreements, and deterring misconduct.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, which is the verbal agreement on the sourcing and paint/varnish requirements, that was not present in HCCT 40/2014. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because, in HCCT 40/2014, the terms and conditions were explicitly written in the Agreement, whereas in our current case, the crucial terms were verbally agreed upon but not included in the written contract.

Due to the presence of this verbal agreement, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the enforceability of verbal agreements and potentially allowing parties to disregard important verbal commitments, unlike in HCCT 40/2014. In HCCT 40/2014, the court's decision was based on the failure to address a written and explicit Limitation Defence, which is a clear procedural irregularity. However, in our current case, the issue revolves around the enforceability of verbal agreements that were not documented in the written contract, which introduces complexities regarding the proof and reliance on such verbal commitments.

Therefore, the presence of the verbal agreement in our current case significantly alters the balance of positive and negative effects, making it inappropriate to apply the same outcome as in HCCT 40/2014. The court should consider the implications of enforcing verbal agreements and the potential for disputes arising from unwritten terms, which were not factors in the precedent case.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCCT 40/2014 should be stated as "When both a breach of contract involving failure to meet material terms and a failure to address central issues in the arbitration process are present, the court should decide to set aside or remit the arbitral award." Omitting the requirement to address central issues (m) from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of arbitral awards being enforced despite significant procedural irregularities, thereby undermining the fairness and integrity of the arbitration process. Indeed, the opinion in HCCT 40/2014 explicitly states that the failure to address the Limitation Defence was crucial to their decision, as it constituted a serious procedural irregularity that led to substantial injustice and unfairness.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCCT 40/2014 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of enforcing arbitral awards that suffer from serious procedural irregularities, such as the failure to address central issues raised by the parties. However, in our current case, the primary issue is the enforceability of verbal agreements that were not documented in the written contract. There is no risk of the same procedural irregularity occurring because the dispute does not involve an arbitration process where central issues were ignored. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—ensuring procedural integrity in arbitration—is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the focus should be on whether the verbal agreements can be enforced and whether Tony's actions constitute a breach of those material terms.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the explicit written terms regarding sourcing and paint/varnish requirements, which were present in the precedent case HCCT 40/2014, requiring this factor for all similar cases of breach of contract involving failure to meet material terms would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would undermine the enforceability of verbal agreements and potentially allow parties to disregard important verbal commitments, which are often crucial in business dealings. Conversely, not requiring explicit written terms would allow for the enforcement of verbal agreements that form the basis of the parties' understanding and expectations. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which include upholding the parties' intentions and ensuring fairness and justice in contractual relationships.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the explicit written terms regarding sourcing and paint/varnish requirements, which were present in HCCT 40/2014, we have the additional factor of a clear verbal agreement on these requirements. This verbal agreement, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of breach of material terms, serves a similar function to the explicit written terms in the precedent case. Given the presence of this verbal agreement, we submit that the reasoning in HCCT 40/2014 still applies, as the positive effects on upholding fairness, protecting business integrity, encouraging compliance with verbal agreements, and deterring misconduct would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCCT 40/2014, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the breach of contract involving failure to meet material terms and the need to address central issues. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the presence of a verbal agreement on sourcing and paint/varnish requirements in the current case, which was not explicitly documented in the written contract.

The proposed legal rule from HCCT 40/2014, which emphasizes the importance of addressing central issues in arbitration and ensuring procedural integrity, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in the context of verbal agreements and their enforceability.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that enforcing verbal agreements upholds fairness and business integrity (Step 4) and the counterargument that the absence of explicit written terms introduces complexities regarding proof and reliance on such verbal commitments (Step 6).

Considering the underlying legal principles of contract law, which include upholding the parties' intentions and ensuring fairness and justice in contractual relationships, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Nick should be allowed to terminate the contract and seek damages. This decision aligns with the principles of fairness and justice, as it recognizes the material terms discussed and agreed upon verbally, even if not explicitly written in the contract. It also serves to protect business integrity and encourage compliance with verbal agreements, which are often crucial in business dealings.

Therefore, the court should recognize Tony's actions as a breach of the material terms discussed and allow Nick to terminate the contract and recover potential damages. This decision is justified because it upholds the principles of fairness, protects business integrity, and encourages ethical business practices, similar to the court's emphasis on procedural integrity in HCCT 40/2014.

   Exceptions:
   - Unless the party deals as consumer; or an express term is inconsistent with a term implied by this Ordinance

### Minor Premise:

1. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 5:
- Nick and Tony have entered into a contract for the supply of a service (supply of wood and finishes).
- Tony is acting in the course of his business.
- Therefore, there is an implied term that Tony will carry out the service with reasonable care and skill.

2. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 6:
- The contract specifies the delivery dates, amounts, price, and wood type, so the time for the service to be carried out is fixed by the contract.
- Therefore, this section does not apply.

3. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 7:
- The consideration for the service (price) is determined by the contract.
- Therefore, this section does not apply.

4. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 8 Subsection 1:
- Nick is not dealing as a consumer; he is acting in the course of his business.
- Therefore, this section does not apply.

5. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 8 Subsections 2 and 3:
- A right, duty, or liability arises under the contract for the supply of a service by virtue of this Ordinance (implied term of reasonable care and skill).
- The contract is silent on the sourcing and paint/varnish requirements, which are implied terms based on Nick's discussions with Tony.
- The implied terms cannot be negatived or varied by express agreement or course of dealing because Nick is not dealing as a consumer, and there is no express term inconsistent with the implied terms.

### Conclusion:

Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 5 applies, and there is an implied term that Tony will carry out the service with reasonable care and skill. Tony's failure to supply locally sourced wood and plant-based finishes constitutes a breach of this implied term. Nick can terminate the contract and seek damages for the breach.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA822/2004 BETWEEN MYRIAD ELECTRONICS LIMITED Plaintiff and ENITY TECHNOLOGY LIMITED Defendant)
In the case of HCA822/2004 BETWEEN MYRIAD ELECTRONICS LIMITED Plaintiff and ENITY TECHNOLOGY LIMITED Defendant (precedent p), the plaintiff claimed for the price of goods sold and delivered, while the defendant claimed set-off and counterclaims for faulty goods, poaching clients, and breach of a separate contract. The court ruled that the defendant should be allowed to defend conditionally on paying into court the sum owed to the plaintiff, while also allowing for the claim for breach of the separate contract.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA822/2004 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Implied Terms**: In HCA822/2004, the defendant argued that the goods were not of merchantable quality and fit for purpose as per the Sale of Goods Ordinance. In our current case, Nick can argue that there were implied terms regarding the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints used.
- **Breach of Contract**: In HCA822/2004, the defendant claimed that the plaintiff breached the contract by supplying faulty goods. In our current case, Tony breached the contract by supplying non-locally sourced wood and using chemical-based varnishes and paints.
- **Right to Terminate**: In HCA822/2004, the court allowed the defendant to defend against the claim, implying that a breach could justify termination or other remedies. In our current case, Nick wishes to terminate the contract due to Tony's breach.
- **Damages**: In HCA822/2004, the defendant sought damages for the breach. In our current case, Nick seeks to recover potential damages for the breach of implied terms.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA822/2004)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a breach of implied terms regarding the quality and fitness for purpose of goods, the court should allow the aggrieved party to terminate the contract and seek damages. This rule was justified in HCA822/2004 because the positive effects (E+) of allowing the defendant to defend and seek remedies for the breach outweighed the negative effects (E-) of enforcing a contract that was not fulfilled as per the implied terms. This upholds the underlying values of fairness and the integrity of contractual obligations.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA822/2004 BETWEEN MYRIAD ELECTRONICS LIMITED Plaintiff and ENITY TECHNOLOGY LIMITED Defendant) are present:

- **Implied Terms**: In HCA822/2004, the defendant argued that the goods were not of merchantable quality and fit for purpose as per the Sale of Goods Ordinance. In our current case, Nick can argue that there were implied terms regarding the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints used. The implied terms here are that the wood should be locally sourced and the varnishes and paints should be plant-based, as these were crucial to Nick's business model and were explicitly communicated to Tony.

- **Breach of Contract**: In HCA822/2004, the defendant claimed that the plaintiff breached the contract by supplying faulty goods. In our current case, Tony breached the contract by supplying non-locally sourced wood and using chemical-based varnishes and paints. This breach goes to the heart of the contract because it directly affects Nick's business reputation and the core values of his eco-friendly business.

- **Right to Terminate**: In HCA822/2004, the court allowed the defendant to defend against the claim, implying that a breach could justify termination or other remedies. In our current case, Nick wishes to terminate the contract due to Tony's breach. Given the significance of the breach to Nick's business model, it is reasonable to argue that Nick has the right to terminate the contract.

- **Damages**: In HCA822/2004, the defendant sought damages for the breach. In our current case, Nick seeks to recover potential damages for the breach of implied terms. These damages could include the cost of replacing the non-compliant wood and finishes, any loss of business due to the breach, and potential reputational damage.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA822/2004, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Contractual Integrity**: Allowing Nick to terminate the contract and seek damages would reinforce the importance of adhering to the terms of a contract, especially when those terms are crucial to the business model and reputation of one of the parties.

2. **Fairness and Justice**: It would be unfair to require Nick to continue under a contract where the fundamental terms have been breached, especially when those terms were explicitly communicated and are central to his business.

3. **Encouraging Good Faith in Business Transactions**: This outcome would encourage parties to act in good faith and ensure that they meet the specific requirements of their contracts, particularly when those requirements are critical to the other party's business.

4. **Deterrence of Future Breaches**: By allowing termination and damages, the court would deter future breaches of similar nature, promoting a more reliable and trustworthy business environment.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should allow Nick to terminate the contract and seek damages. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA822/2004, it would uphold the underlying values of fairness, contractual integrity, and good faith in business transactions.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the explicit communication of specific requirements regarding the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints, that was not present in HCA822/2004 BETWEEN MYRIAD ELECTRONICS LIMITED Plaintiff and ENITY TECHNOLOGY LIMITED Defendant. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of implied terms and breach of contract.

In HCA822/2004, the implied terms were based on general statutory provisions regarding merchantable quality and fitness for purpose under the Sale of Goods Ordinance. However, in our current case, Nick explicitly communicated his specific requirements to Tony, which were crucial to his business model and reputation. This explicit communication creates a stronger basis for the implied terms regarding the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints.

Due to this explicit communication, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences than positive ones, unlike in HCA822/2004. Specifically, it would undermine the importance of clear and explicit communications in contractual relationships, potentially leading to unfair outcomes where one party's specific and crucial requirements are ignored. This would negatively impact the values of fairness and good faith in business transactions, as it would allow a party to disregard explicit instructions without facing appropriate consequences.

Therefore, the presence of this explicit communication in our current case significantly alters the balance of positive and negative effects, justifying a different outcome where Nick should be allowed to terminate the contract and seek damages.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from HCA822/2004 BETWEEN MYRIAD ELECTRONICS LIMITED Plaintiff and ENITY TECHNOLOGY LIMITED Defendant should be stated as: "When both [implied terms regarding the quality and fitness for purpose of goods] and [explicit communication of specific requirements crucial to the business model] are present, the court should decide [to allow the aggrieved party to terminate the contract and seek damages]." Omitting [explicit communication of specific requirements crucial to the business model] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of undermining the importance of clear and explicit communications in contractual relationships, potentially leading to unfair outcomes where one party's specific and crucial requirements are ignored]. Indeed, the opinion in HCA822/2004 explicitly states that the implied terms were based on general statutory provisions, and the court's decision was influenced by the lack of explicit communication of specific requirements.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in HCA822/2004 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of enforcing a contract that was not fulfilled as per the implied terms of merchantable quality and fitness for purpose. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence occurring because the explicit communication of specific requirements by Nick to Tony creates a stronger basis for the implied terms. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—to address general implied terms without explicit communication—is not relevant to our situation where explicit communication of crucial requirements was made.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the explicit statutory provisions regarding merchantable quality and fitness for purpose (factor m), which were present in the precedent case HCA822/2004 BETWEEN MYRIAD ELECTRONICS LIMITED Plaintiff and ENITY TECHNOLOGY LIMITED Defendant, requiring this factor for all similar cases of implied terms and breach of contract would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would undermine the importance of explicit communications and agreements made between parties, especially when such communications are crucial to the business model and reputation of one of the parties. Conversely, not requiring the explicit statutory provisions would allow for a more flexible and fair approach that takes into account the specific circumstances and communications between the parties. This better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, which aim to uphold fairness, good faith, and the integrity of contractual obligations.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the explicit statutory provisions regarding merchantable quality and fitness for purpose (factor m), which were present in HCA822/2004, we have the additional factor of explicit communication of specific requirements crucial to the business model (factor n). This explicit communication, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of implied terms and breach of contract, serves a similar function to the statutory provisions in the precedent case. Given the presence of explicit communication, we submit that the reasoning in HCA822/2004 still applies, as the positive effects on fairness, good faith, and the integrity of contractual obligations would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. Therefore, Nick should be allowed to terminate the contract and seek damages for Tony's breach of the implied terms regarding the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints used.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA822/2004 BETWEEN MYRIAD ELECTRONICS LIMITED Plaintiff and ENITY TECHNOLOGY LIMITED Defendant, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of implied terms and a breach of contract. However, it also differs significantly in that Nick explicitly communicated his specific requirements regarding the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints, which were crucial to his business model and reputation.

The proposed legal rule that when both implied terms regarding the quality and fitness for purpose of goods and explicit communication of specific requirements crucial to the business model are present, the court should decide to allow the aggrieved party to terminate the contract and seek damages, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that explicit communication of specific requirements creates a stronger basis for implied terms (from Nick's side) and the counterpoint that the precedent case dealt with general statutory provisions without explicit communication (from Tony's side).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, good faith, and the integrity of contractual obligations, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Nick should be allowed to terminate the contract and seek damages. This decision is justified because it upholds the importance of adhering to explicit communications and agreements made between parties, especially when such communications are crucial to the business model and reputation of one of the parties. It also reinforces the values of fairness and good faith in business transactions, deterring future breaches of similar nature.

Therefore, the final decision is that Nick can terminate the contract for Tony's breach of the implied terms regarding the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints used, and he is entitled to recover potential damages. This outcome aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency.

   - Maintain an action against the seller for damages for the breach of warranty

4. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 55 Subsections 2 and 3

   Conditions:
   - There is a breach of warranty of quality

   Consequences:
   - The measure of damages for breach of warranty is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the breach of warranty

5. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 55 Subsection 4

   Conditions:
   - The buyer has set up the breach of warranty in diminution or extinction of the price

   Consequences:
   - The buyer is not prevented from maintaining an action for the same breach of warranty if he has suffered further damage

### Minor Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 16 Subsection 3:
- Tony sells wood in the course of a business.
- Nick expressly made known to Tony that the wood must be locally sourced and the varnishes and paints must be plant-based for his eco home pods.
- Therefore, there is an implied condition that the wood supplied by Tony must be locally sourced and the finishes must be plant-based.
- The exception does not apply as Nick relied on Tony's skill and judgment, and it was reasonable for him to do so.

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 16 Subsection 2:
- Tony sells wood in the course of a business.
- Therefore, there is an implied condition that the wood supplied by Tony is of merchantable quality.
- The exceptions do not apply as there is no indication that defects were drawn to Nick's attention, nor did Nick examine the goods before the contract was made, and the contract is not for sale by sample.

3. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 55 Subsection 1:
- There is a breach of warranty by Tony as the wood was not locally sourced and the finishes were not plant-based.
- Nick may treat this breach of condition as a breach of warranty.
- Nick is not entitled to reject the goods solely based on the breach of warranty.
- Nick may set up the breach of warranty in diminution or extinction of the price or maintain an action against Tony for damages.

4. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 55 Subsections 2 and 3:
- There is a breach of warranty of quality as the wood and finishes did not meet the specified requirements.
- The measure of damages is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting from the breach.
- Such loss is prima facie the difference between the value of the goods at the time of delivery and the value they would have had if they had met the warranty.

5. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 55 Subsection 4:
- Nick has set up the breach of warranty in diminution or extinction of the price.
- Nick is not prevented from maintaining an action for the same breach of warranty if he has suffered further damage.

   - There is no causal connection between the breach and the failure to meet the condition or deadline

### Minor Premise:

1. Kensland Realty Limited v Whale View Investment Limited:
- Nick and Tony entered into a contract for the supply of wood.
- Tony breached the obligation by supplying non-locally sourced wood and using chemical-based varnishes and paints, contrary to Nick's environmental policies.
- This breach directly affects Nick's ability to maintain his reputation as an ethical builder, which is a critical condition for his business.
- Tony's breach of supplying non-compliant materials is causing Nick to fail in maintaining his eco-friendly business standards.
- Tony cannot take advantage of Nick's failure to maintain his eco-friendly standards, which is a consequence of Tony's breach.

### Conclusion:

Kensland Realty Limited v Whale View Investment Limited applies, and Tony is prevented from asserting rights or claiming benefits which arise in consequence of his breach. Therefore, Nick can terminate the contract and seek damages for any loss suffered due to Tony's breach of the implied terms.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (FACV No. 3 of 2006)
In the case of FACV No. 3 of 2006 between Mariner International Hotels Limited and Sino Land Company Limited (Appellants) and Atlas Limited and Hang Lung Group Limited (Respondents) (precedent p), the court ruled that practical completion of the hotel by a specified date was a condition precedent to the completion of the purchase. The court further held that practical completion meant the hotel had to be free from any patent defects other than ones to be ignored as trifling. The court found that the vendor had repudiated the sale agreement by failing to meet this standard, thus allowing the purchaser to terminate the contract and claim damages (outcome o).

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in FACV No. 3 of 2006 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Condition Precedent**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In FACV No. 3 of 2006, the sale agreement specified that practical completion of the hotel by a certain date was a condition precedent to the completion of the purchase. In our current case, Nick's requirement for locally sourced wood and plant-based varnishes and paints can be seen as a condition precedent to his business operations, as any deviation would destroy his credibility in the eco home pod marketplace.

- **Legal Concept 2: Breach of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** In FACV No. 3 of 2006, the vendor's failure to deliver a hotel free from non-trifling patent defects constituted a breach of contract. In our current case, Tony's failure to supply locally sourced wood and plant-based finishes as promised constitutes a breach of contract.

- **Legal Concept 3: Repudiation**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In FACV No. 3 of 2006, the vendor's failure to meet the condition precedent was deemed a repudiation of the contract. In our current case, Tony's failure to meet the specified requirements can be seen as a repudiation of the contract, allowing Nick to terminate the agreement.

- **Legal Concept 4: Damages**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** In FACV No. 3 of 2006, the purchaser was entitled to terminate the contract and claim damages due to the vendor's breach. In our current case, Nick seeks to terminate the contract and recover potential damages due to Tony's breach.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (FACV No. 3 of 2006)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern where a condition precedent is not met, the court should decide that the non-breaching party is entitled to terminate the contract and claim damages. This rule was justified in FACV No. 3 of 2006 because the positive effects (E+) of allowing the non-breaching party to terminate the contract and claim damages uphold the underlying values and principles of contract law, such as the importance of fulfilling contractual obligations and maintaining the integrity of business agreements. The negative effects (E-) of this outcome, such as potential financial loss to the breaching party, are outweighed by the need to protect the non-breaching party's interests and uphold the terms of the contract.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (FACV No. 3 of 2006) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Condition Precedent**
  - **Fact Pattern 1:** In FACV No. 3 of 2006, the sale agreement specified that practical completion of the hotel by a certain date was a condition precedent to the completion of the purchase. In our current case, Nick's requirement for locally sourced wood and plant-based varnishes and paints can be seen as a condition precedent to his business operations, as any deviation would destroy his credibility in the eco home pod marketplace.

- **Legal Concept 2: Breach of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 2:** In FACV No. 3 of 2006, the vendor's failure to deliver a hotel free from non-trifling patent defects constituted a breach of contract. In our current case, Tony's failure to supply locally sourced wood and plant-based finishes as promised constitutes a breach of contract.

- **Legal Concept 3: Repudiation**
  - **Fact Pattern 3:** In FACV No. 3 of 2006, the vendor's failure to meet the condition precedent was deemed a repudiation of the contract. In our current case, Tony's failure to meet the specified requirements can be seen as a repudiation of the contract, allowing Nick to terminate the agreement.

- **Legal Concept 4: Damages**
  - **Fact Pattern 4:** In FACV No. 3 of 2006, the purchaser was entitled to terminate the contract and claim damages due to the vendor's breach. In our current case, Nick seeks to terminate the contract and recover potential damages due to Tony's breach.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in FACV No. 3 of 2006, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Contractual Integrity:** Enforcing the condition precedent ensures that parties adhere to the specific terms and conditions agreed upon, maintaining the integrity of contractual agreements.
2. **Protecting Business Reputation:** For Nick, maintaining his reputation as an ethical builder is crucial. Allowing him to terminate the contract and claim damages protects his business interests and credibility in the eco home pod marketplace.
3. **Deterring Breach of Contract:** By holding Tony accountable for his breach, it sets a precedent that suppliers must meet their contractual obligations, thereby deterring future breaches.
4. **Fairness and Justice:** It ensures that the non-breaching party, Nick, is not unfairly disadvantaged by the breach and can seek appropriate remedies to mitigate his losses.

The negative effects, such as potential financial loss to Tony, are outweighed by the need to protect Nick's business interests and uphold the terms of the contract. Therefore, the court should allow Nick to terminate the contract and claim damages, consistent with the outcome in FACV No. 3 of 2006.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case FACV No. 3 of 2006, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of a clearly defined condition precedent in the contract, which was the practical completion of the hotel by a specified date. This condition precedent was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as upholding contractual integrity and protecting the purchaser's interests, outweighed any potential drawbacks, such as financial loss to the vendor. The clear stipulation of practical completion as a condition precedent provided a concrete basis for the court to determine that the vendor's failure constituted a breach justifying termination and damages.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of a clearly defined condition precedent is notably absent. The contract between Nick and Tony is silent on the specific requirements for locally sourced wood and plant-based varnishes and paints. While these requirements were discussed and agreed upon verbally, they were not explicitly included in the written contract. This absence of a clearly defined condition precedent in the written agreement makes it more challenging to argue that Tony's failure to meet these requirements constitutes a breach justifying termination and damages.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, which is the verbal agreement and the reliance on ethical sourcing and plant-based finishes, that was not present in FACV No. 3 of 2006. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the reliance on verbal agreements and ethical considerations introduces an element of implied terms and expectations that were not explicitly documented in the written contract.

Due to this reliance on verbal agreements and ethical considerations, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as increased uncertainty and potential disputes over verbal agreements, than positive ones, unlike in FACV No. 3 of 2006. The absence of explicit terms in the written contract in our case makes it more difficult to establish a clear breach and justify termination and damages, thereby potentially leading to more disputes and undermining the stability and predictability of contractual relationships.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from FACV No. 3 of 2006 should be stated as 'When both a clearly defined condition precedent and a breach of that condition are present, the court should decide that the non-breaching party is entitled to terminate the contract and claim damages.' Omitting the clearly defined condition precedent from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of increased uncertainty and potential disputes over verbal agreements. Indeed, the opinion in FACV No. 3 of 2006 explicitly states that the clear stipulation of practical completion as a condition precedent was crucial to their decision, as it provided a concrete basis for determining the breach and justifying termination and damages.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in FACV No. 3 of 2006 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of parties being unable to enforce specific and crucial terms of their agreements, thereby ensuring that contractual obligations are met and protecting the interests of the non-breaching party. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence occurring because the contract between Nick and Tony lacks a clearly defined condition precedent regarding the sourcing and finishes of the wood. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—enforcing clearly defined contractual terms—is not relevant to our situation where such terms are absent.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the clearly defined condition precedent (factor m), which was present in the precedent case FACV No. 3 of 2006, requiring this factor for all similar cases of breach of contract would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would allow parties to evade their verbal commitments and implied terms, thereby undermining the trust and reliability essential in business relationships. Conversely, not requiring a clearly defined condition precedent would allow for the enforcement of verbal agreements and implied terms, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, such as the importance of fulfilling all agreed-upon obligations and maintaining the integrity of business agreements.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the clearly defined condition precedent (factor m), which was present in FACV No. 3 of 2006, we have the additional factor of a verbal agreement and reliance on ethical sourcing and plant-based finishes (factor n). This factor n, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of breach of contract and the importance of maintaining business reputation (i*), serves a similar function to the clearly defined condition precedent in the precedent case. Given the presence of factor n, we submit that the reasoning in FACV No. 3 of 2006 still applies, as the positive effects on upholding contractual integrity, protecting business reputation, and deterring breach of contract would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to FACV No. 3 of 2006, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of a breach of contract and the importance of maintaining business reputation. However, it also differs in a significant way: the absence of a clearly defined condition precedent in the written contract between Nick and Tony.

The proposed legal rule of "When both a clearly defined condition precedent and a breach of that condition are present, the court should decide that the non-breaching party is entitled to terminate the contract and claim damages" finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of upholding contractual integrity and protecting business reputation (strong points from Nick's side) against the potential for increased uncertainty and disputes over verbal agreements (strong points from Tony's side).

Considering the underlying legal principles of contract law, such as the importance of fulfilling all agreed-upon obligations and maintaining the integrity of business agreements, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Nick should be allowed to terminate the contract and claim damages. This decision is justified by the presence of a verbal agreement and reliance on ethical sourcing and plant-based finishes, which serve a similar function to a clearly defined condition precedent in maintaining the integrity of the business relationship.

Therefore, the court should allow Nick to terminate the contract and recover potential damages due to Tony's breach, consistent with the principles established in FACV No. 3 of 2006, while also recognizing the importance of implied terms and verbal agreements in maintaining business integrity and trust.


# Contract Law: Whether Tony's representations about the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints used can be considered as misrepresentations

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1 and 2

### Major Premise:

1. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1
   
   Conditions:
   - A person has entered into a contract after a misrepresentation
   - The misrepresentation has been made to him by another party
   - He has suffered loss as a result of the misrepresentation
   - If the misrepresentation had been made fraudulently, the person making the misrepresentation would be liable to damages

   Consequences:
   - The person making the misrepresentation shall still be liable to damages even though the misrepresentation was not made fraudulently

   Exceptions:
   - The person making the misrepresentation proves that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the facts represented were true
   - The person making the misrepresentation did believe up to the time the contract was made that the facts represented were true

2. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - A person has entered into a contract
   - He entered into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to him
   - The misrepresentation was not made to him fraudulently
   - He would be entitled, by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract
   - It is claimed in any proceedings arising out of the contract that the contract ought to be or has been rescinded
   - The court or arbitrator is of opinion that it would be equitable to do so, having regard to:
     * The nature of the misrepresentation
     * The loss that would be caused by it if the contract were upheld
     * The loss that rescission would cause to the other party

   Consequences:
   - The court or arbitrator may declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1:
- Nick has entered into a contract with Tony after a misrepresentation.
- The misrepresentation was made to him by Tony.
- Nick has suffered loss in the form of potential damage to his reputation and credibility in the eco home pod marketplace.
- If Tony had made the misrepresentation fraudulently, Tony would have been liable to damages.
- Tony may argue that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the facts represented were true and that he did believe up to the time the contract was made that the facts represented were true. However, given the specific nature of Nick's requirements and Tony's explicit promises, it is unlikely that Tony can successfully prove this.
- Therefore, this section applies, and Tony is liable to damages.

2. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2:
- Nick has entered into a contract for the supply of wood.
- Tony's claims about the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints used are misrepresentations.
- Nick has entered into the contract after these misrepresentations have been made to him.
- Tony did not make these misrepresentations fraudulently.
- Nick would be entitled, by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract.
- Nick wishes to terminate the contract and recover potential damages.
- Balancing the nature of the misrepresentation,
  * it is a material misrepresentation affecting Nick's business reputation and credibility;
  * the loss that would be suffered by Nick if the contract was upheld is significant due to the potential damage to his business reputation;
  * the loss to Tony if rescission were granted would be the loss of a five-year contract.
- Therefore, this section applies, and the court would declare the contract subsisting and award Nick damages in lieu of rescission.

### Conclusion:

Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1 and 2 apply. Tony is liable to damages for the misrepresentation, and the court would declare the contract subsisting and award Nick damages in lieu of rescission.

## Deductive Reasoning: cfa

### Relevant law:

Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, Cap. 71

### Major Premise:

1. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, Cap. 71

   Conditions:
   - A representation is made by one party to another regarding the subject-matter of a sale.
   - The representation is misleading.
   - The representation induces the other party to enter into the agreement.
   - The agreement contains a clause that purports to exclude or restrict liability for misrepresentation.
   - The clause does not satisfy the requirement of reasonableness as stated in section 3(1) of the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, Cap. 71.

   Consequences:
   - The misled party is entitled to rescind the agreement.
   - The clause excluding or restricting liability for misrepresentation is of no effect.

   Exceptions:
   - The clause satisfies the requirement of reasonableness as stated in section 3(1) of the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, Cap. 71.

   Citation:
   - Green Park Properties Limited v Dorku Limited

### Minor Premise:

1. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, Cap. 71:
- Nick has entered into a contract with Tony after a representation was made by Tony regarding the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints used.
- The representation made by Tony was misleading as the wood was not always locally sourced and the varnishes and paints were chemical-based.
- The misleading representation induced Nick to enter into the agreement, as Nick's business depends on his reputation as an ethical builder.
- The agreement is silent on the sourcing and paint/varnish requirements, and there is no clause that purports to exclude or restrict liability for misrepresentation.
- Therefore, the condition regarding the clause excluding or restricting liability for misrepresentation does not apply.

### Conclusion:

The conditions of the major premise are partially satisfied. Since the agreement does not contain a clause that purports to exclude or restrict liability for misrepresentation, the specific provisions of the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, Cap. 71, regarding the reasonableness of such a clause do not apply. However, the misleading representation by Tony can still be considered a misrepresentation under general contract law principles.

Nick is entitled to rescind the agreement based on the misrepresentation made by Tony regarding the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints used. Nick may also seek damages for any losses incurred as a result of the misrepresentation.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS)
In the case of PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS [2021] HKCFI 2539; HCA 1905/2018 (precedent p), the Plaintiff sought damages for misrepresentation and breach of contract related to the supply of marble and incidental services. The court ruled that expert evidence was necessary to resolve the issues of defects and quantum of damages, but emphasized the importance of properly framed questions and the necessity of expert evidence. The court refused to give directions for expert evidence until the parties properly considered the real issues in dispute and formulated appropriate questions for the experts.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Misrepresentation**: In both cases, there are allegations that the defendant made false representations about the quality and characteristics of the goods supplied. In precedent p, the misrepresentation was about the quality and value of the marble. In the current case, the misrepresentation concerns the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints used.
- **Breach of Contract**: Both cases involve claims that the defendant breached implied terms of the contract. In precedent p, the breach was related to the marble not corresponding to the approved sample and not being of merchantable quality. In the current case, the breach pertains to the wood not being locally sourced and the varnishes and paints not being plant-based as promised.
- **Expert Evidence**: The necessity of expert evidence to resolve the issues in dispute is a common theme. In precedent p, expert evidence was required to determine the defects and quantum of damages. In the current case, expert evidence may be needed to assess the environmental impact and quality of the materials supplied.
- **Contractual Silence on Specific Terms**: In both cases, the written contracts were silent on specific terms that were allegedly misrepresented. In precedent p, the contract did not specify that the marble would correspond to a sample. In the current case, the contract does not explicitly mention the sourcing and type of varnishes and paints.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS)
This suggests a general rule that when we see fact patterns involving misrepresentation and breach of implied terms in a contract, the court should decide that expert evidence is necessary to resolve the issues in dispute. This rule was justified in PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that the expert evidence is relevant, properly framed, and necessary for the effective trial of the real issues in dispute outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially prolonging the trial and increasing costs. This approach promotes procedural economy, cost-effectiveness, and the fair resolution of disputes, aligning with the underlying objectives of the Civil Justice Reform.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS) are present:

- **Misrepresentation**: In both cases, there are allegations that the defendant made false representations about the quality and characteristics of the goods supplied.
  - **Fact Pattern**: In the precedent case, the misrepresentation was about the quality and value of the marble. In the current case, the misrepresentation concerns the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints used.

- **Breach of Contract**: Both cases involve claims that the defendant breached implied terms of the contract.
  - **Fact Pattern**: In the precedent case, the breach was related to the marble not corresponding to the approved sample and not being of merchantable quality. In the current case, the breach pertains to the wood not being locally sourced and the varnishes and paints not being plant-based as promised.

- **Expert Evidence**: The necessity of expert evidence to resolve the issues in dispute is a common theme.
  - **Fact Pattern**: In the precedent case, expert evidence was required to determine the defects and quantum of damages. In the current case, expert evidence may be needed to assess the environmental impact and quality of the materials supplied.

- **Contractual Silence on Specific Terms**: In both cases, the written contracts were silent on specific terms that were allegedly misrepresented.
  - **Fact Pattern**: In the precedent case, the contract did not specify that the marble would correspond to a sample. In the current case, the contract does not explicitly mention the sourcing and type of varnishes and paints.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Relevance and Necessity of Expert Evidence**: By requiring properly framed questions and relevant expert evidence, the court can ensure that the trial focuses on the real issues in dispute, thereby promoting procedural economy and cost-effectiveness.

2. **Promoting Fair Resolution of Disputes**: Properly framed expert evidence can assist the court in making informed decisions, which is crucial for the fair resolution of disputes. This aligns with the underlying objectives of the Civil Justice Reform.

3. **Facilitating Settlement**: The use of single joint experts, where appropriate, can help narrow the scope of the issues in dispute, shorten the trial, and facilitate settlement of issues, often leading to a global settlement of the action.

4. **Preventing Wastage of Time and Costs**: By ensuring that expert evidence is only adduced when necessary and relevant, the court can prevent unnecessary prolongation of the trial and wastage of costs, which is in the interest of both parties and the judicial system.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS, it would have the positive effects of ensuring relevance and necessity of expert evidence, promoting fair resolution of disputes, facilitating settlement, and preventing wastage of time and costs.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of expert evidence to resolve the issues of defects and quantum of damages. Expert evidence was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as the accurate determination of defects and appropriate damages, outweighed any potential drawbacks, such as the prolongation of the trial and increased costs. This was because expert evidence provided the necessary technical insights to resolve complex factual disputes.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of expert evidence is notably absent as the issues at hand—whether the wood was locally sourced and whether the varnishes and paints were plant-based—do not inherently require technical expertise to resolve. These issues can be determined through documentary evidence, witness testimony, and possibly simple laboratory tests, rather than the complex expert analysis required in the precedent case. Therefore, the absence of the need for expert evidence in our current case distinguishes it from the precedent case.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—Nick's explicit emphasis on his reputation as an ethical builder and the critical importance of adhering to environmental policies—that was not present in PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of misrepresentation and breach of contract.

Because of Nick's explicit emphasis on his reputation and the critical importance of adhering to environmental policies, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences than positive ones. Unlike in PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS, where the dispute was primarily about the quality and value of marble, the current case involves potential damage to Nick's business reputation and credibility in the eco home pod marketplace. This reputational damage could have long-term negative effects on Nick's business, which outweigh the procedural economy and cost-effectiveness considerations that justified the court's decision in the precedent case.

Therefore, the presence of this crucial factor in our current case necessitates a different approach, focusing on the immediate termination of the contract and recovery of potential damages to mitigate the reputational harm to Nick's business.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS** should be stated as: "When both [misrepresentation and breach of contract] and [the necessity of expert evidence to resolve complex factual disputes] are present, the court should decide [to require properly framed expert evidence before proceeding]." Omitting [the necessity of expert evidence to resolve complex factual disputes] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of the court making uninformed decisions on technical matters, potentially leading to unjust outcomes]. Indeed, the opinion in **PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS** explicitly states that the necessity of expert evidence was crucial to their decision, as it ensured that the trial focused on the real issues in dispute and promoted procedural economy and cost-effectiveness.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of the court making uninformed decisions on technical matters, potentially leading to unjust outcomes]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [the court making uninformed decisions on technical matters] occurring because the issues at hand—whether the wood was locally sourced and whether the varnishes and paints were plant-based—do not inherently require technical expertise to resolve. These issues can be determined through documentary evidence, witness testimony, and possibly simple laboratory tests, rather than the complex expert analysis required in the precedent case. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the necessity of expert evidence to resolve complex factual disputes, which was present in the precedent case PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS, requiring this factor for all similar cases of misrepresentation and breach of contract would lead to the undesirable consequence of potentially overlooking straightforward breaches of contract and misrepresentations that do not require technical expertise to resolve. Conversely, not requiring the necessity of expert evidence would allow for a more efficient and just resolution of disputes where the issues can be determined through simpler means, such as documentary evidence and witness testimony. This approach better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, which aim to promote procedural economy, cost-effectiveness, and the fair resolution of disputes.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the necessity of expert evidence to resolve complex factual disputes, which was present in PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS, we have the additional factor of Nick's explicit emphasis on his reputation as an ethical builder and the critical importance of adhering to environmental policies. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of misrepresentation and breach of contract, serves a similar function to the necessity of expert evidence in the precedent case. Given the presence of Nick's reputational concerns, we submit that the reasoning in PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS still applies, as the positive effects on promoting procedural economy, cost-effectiveness, and the fair resolution of disputes would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. This approach ensures that the court addresses the real issues in dispute and mitigates the reputational harm to Nick's business, aligning with the underlying objectives of the Civil Justice Reform.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations:

**Key Similarities:**
1. **Misrepresentation**: Both cases involve allegations of misrepresentation regarding the quality and characteristics of the goods supplied.
2. **Breach of Contract**: Both cases involve claims of breach of implied terms of the contract.
3. **Contractual Silence on Specific Terms**: In both cases, the written contracts were silent on specific terms that were allegedly misrepresented.

**Key Differences:**
1. **Necessity of Expert Evidence**: In the precedent case, expert evidence was crucial to resolve complex factual disputes about defects and quantum of damages. In the current case, the issues at hand (sourcing of wood and type of varnishes and paints) do not inherently require technical expertise and can be resolved through simpler means.
2. **Reputational Concerns**: The current case involves significant reputational concerns for Nick, which were not present in the precedent case. Nick's business depends on his reputation as an ethical builder, and any deviation from his environmental policies could have long-term negative effects on his business.

**Proposed Legal Rule:**
The proposed rule from the precedent case is that when both misrepresentation and breach of contract are present, and the necessity of expert evidence to resolve complex factual disputes is established, the court should require properly framed expert evidence before proceeding.

**Assessment of Arguments:**
- **Initial Analogy (Steps 1-4)**: The initial analogy correctly identifies the shared legal concepts and fact patterns between the two cases. It also highlights the importance of expert evidence in resolving complex factual disputes.
- **Rebuttal Arguments (Steps 5-8)**: The rebuttal arguments effectively distinguish the current case from the precedent by emphasizing the absence of the necessity for expert evidence and the presence of reputational concerns. These arguments highlight that the issues in the current case can be resolved through simpler means and that reputational harm to Nick's business is a significant factor.
- **Surrebuttal Arguments (Steps 9-10)**: The surrebuttal arguments downplay the significance of the necessity for expert evidence and argue that Nick's reputational concerns serve a similar function in ensuring the fair resolution of disputes. However, these arguments do not fully address the practical differences in resolving the issues without expert evidence.

**Final Decision:**
Considering the underlying legal principles of promoting procedural economy, cost-effectiveness, and the fair resolution of disputes, we conclude that the court should allow Nick to terminate the contract and seek damages without requiring expert evidence. The key factors influencing this decision are:

1. **Reputational Harm**: Nick's business reputation as an ethical builder is crucial, and any deviation from his environmental policies could have long-term negative effects on his business. This factor outweighs the procedural economy and cost-effectiveness considerations that justified the court's decision in the precedent case.
2. **Simplicity of Issues**: The issues at hand (sourcing of wood and type of varnishes and paints) do not require complex technical expertise and can be resolved through documentary evidence, witness testimony, and simple laboratory tests.

Therefore, the court should focus on the immediate termination of the contract and recovery of potential damages to mitigate the reputational harm to Nick's business. This approach aligns with the principles of justice and legal consistency while addressing the specific circumstances of the current case.

   Conditions:
   - A contract contains a term which would exclude or restrict any liability to which a party to a contract may be subject by reason of any misrepresentation made by him before the contract was made.
   - A contract contains a term which would exclude or restrict any remedy available to another party to the contract by reason of such a misrepresentation.

   Consequences:
   - That term shall be of no effect except in so far as it satisfies the requirement of reasonableness as stated in section 3(1) of the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 71).
   - It is for the person claiming that the term satisfies that requirement to show that it does.

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 2:
- Nick has entered into a contract with Tony after a misrepresentation.
- The misrepresentation has become a term of the contract as Tony promised that all wood would be locally sourced and all varnishes and paints would be plant-based.
- The contract has been performed for three months.
- Nick would be entitled to rescind the contract without alleging fraud because the misrepresentation was material to the contract.

2. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1:
- Nick has entered into a contract with Tony after a misrepresentation made by Tony.
- Nick has suffered loss as his business reputation and credibility in the eco home pod marketplace are at risk.
- If Tony had made the misrepresentation fraudulently, Tony would be liable to damages.
- Tony may argue that he had reasonable grounds to believe and did believe up to the time the contract was made that the facts represented were true, but given the specific nature of Nick's requirements, this defense may be weak.

3. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 4:
- The contract does not contain any term which would exclude or restrict liability for misrepresentation or any remedy available to Nick by reason of such a misrepresentation.
- Therefore, this section does not apply.

### Conclusion:

Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 2 and Section 3 Subsection 1 apply. Nick is entitled to rescind the contract based on Tony's misrepresentations and may also be entitled to recover damages for the loss suffered due to the misrepresentation.

## Deductive Reasoning: cfa

### Relevant law:

Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, Cap. 71

### Major Premise:

1. Green Park Properties Limited v Dorku Limited

   Conditions:
   - A party makes a representation regarding the subject-matter of the sale.
   - The representation is misleading.
   - The other party relies on the representation to enter into the agreement.

   Consequences:
   - The misled party is entitled to rescind the agreement.

   Exceptions:
   - The term excluding liability for misrepresentation satisfies the requirement of reasonableness as stated in section 3(1) of the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, Cap.71.

2. Green Park Properties Limited v Dorku Limited

   Conditions:
   - A party is induced to enter into an agreement based on a representation made by the other party.
   - The representation turns out to be misleading.
   - The misleading representation is material to the agreement.
   - The agreement contains a clause that attempts to exclude or restrict liability for misrepresentation.
   - The clause does not satisfy the requirement of reasonableness as stated in section 3(1) of the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, Cap.71.

   Consequences:
   - The misled party is entitled to rescind the agreement and recover damages.

   Exceptions:
   - The clause satisfies the requirement of reasonableness.

### Minor Premise:

1. Green Park Properties Limited v Dorku Limited (First Set of Conditions):
- Nick made it clear to Tony that his business depends on using locally sourced wood and plant-based paints and varnishes.
- Tony represented that he could comply with these requirements.
- This representation was misleading because Tony supplied wood from Canada and used chemical-based varnishes and paints.
- Nick relied on Tony's representation to enter into the agreement.

   Therefore, Nick is entitled to rescind the agreement unless there is a term excluding liability for misrepresentation that satisfies the requirement of reasonableness.

2. Green Park Properties Limited v Dorku Limited (Second Set of Conditions):
- Nick was induced to enter into the agreement based on Tony's representation.
- The representation turned out to be misleading.
- The misleading representation was material to the agreement because it directly affected Nick's business model and reputation.
- The agreement does not contain a clause that attempts to exclude or restrict liability for misrepresentation.

   Therefore, Nick is entitled to rescind the agreement and recover damages.

### Conclusion:

Nick is entitled to rescind the agreement and recover damages based on Tony's misrepresentations. The conditions for rescission and recovery of damages are satisfied, and there are no applicable exceptions.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (LEUNG CHI KIN TERENCE v. ECOSUCCESS LTD)

In the case of LEUNG CHI KIN TERENCE v. ECOSUCCESS LTD [2021] HKCFI 1725 (precedent p), the court dealt with a situation where the applicants sought to set aside statutory demands based on alleged misrepresentations and other grounds. The court ruled that the applicants could not rely on the alleged misrepresentations to avoid their obligations under the contract because they had not rescinded the contract and had, in fact, affirmed it by their conduct. The court also emphasized that even if the principal obligation was unenforceable, the guarantors would still be liable under the indemnity clause.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in LEUNG CHI KIN TERENCE v. ECOSUCCESS LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Misrepresentation**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, one party alleges that the other made false representations that induced them to enter into the contract. In LEUNG CHI KIN TERENCE, the applicants alleged misrepresentations about the control of PB companies. In our current case, Nick alleges that Tony misrepresented the sourcing and type of varnishes and paints used.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Affirmation of Contract**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In both cases, the party alleging misrepresentation continued to act under the contract without rescinding it. In LEUNG CHI KIN TERENCE, BMC continued to perform under the contract. In our current case, Nick continued to accept deliveries for three months before discovering the misrepresentations.
  
- **Legal Concept 3: Indemnity Clause**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In LEUNG CHI KIN TERENCE, the court emphasized the indemnity clause that made the guarantors liable even if the principal obligation was unenforceable. While our current case does not involve a guarantor, the principle that contractual obligations can be enforced despite certain issues is relevant.
  
- **Legal Concept 4: Requirement for Clear and Unequivocal Rescission**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In both cases, the court required a clear and unequivocal act of rescission to terminate the contract based on misrepresentation. In LEUNG CHI KIN TERENCE, the court found no such act. In our current case, Nick has not yet taken any clear and unequivocal steps to rescind the contract.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (LEUNG CHI KIN TERENCE v. ECOSUCCESS LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a party alleging misrepresentation but continuing to perform under the contract without clear and unequivocal rescission, the court should decide that the contract remains enforceable. This rule was justified in LEUNG CHI KIN TERENCE v. ECOSUCCESS LTD because the positive effects of upholding contractual obligations and ensuring certainty in commercial transactions outweigh the negative effects of allowing parties to avoid their obligations based on unproven or belatedly asserted misrepresentations.

Therefore, applying this rule to our current case, Nick may face difficulties in terminating the contract and recovering potential damages unless he can demonstrate a clear and unequivocal act of rescission and provide precise factual evidence of the misrepresentations.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (LEUNG CHI KIN TERENCE v. ECOSUCCESS LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Misrepresentation**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, one party alleges that the other made false representations that induced them to enter into the contract. In LEUNG CHI KIN TERENCE, the applicants alleged misrepresentations about the control of PB companies. In our current case, Nick alleges that Tony misrepresented the sourcing and type of varnishes and paints used.

- **Legal Concept 2: Affirmation of Contract**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In both cases, the party alleging misrepresentation continued to act under the contract without rescinding it. In LEUNG CHI KIN TERENCE, BMC continued to perform under the contract. In our current case, Nick continued to accept deliveries for three months before discovering the misrepresentations.

- **Legal Concept 3: Indemnity Clause**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In LEUNG CHI KIN TERENCE, the court emphasized the indemnity clause that made the guarantors liable even if the principal obligation was unenforceable. While our current case does not involve a guarantor, the principle that contractual obligations can be enforced despite certain issues is relevant.

- **Legal Concept 4: Requirement for Clear and Unequivocal Rescission**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In both cases, the court required a clear and unequivocal act of rescission to terminate the contract based on misrepresentation. In LEUNG CHI KIN TERENCE, the court found no such act. In our current case, Nick has not yet taken any clear and unequivocal steps to rescind the contract.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in LEUNG CHI KIN TERENCE v. ECOSUCCESS LTD. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Contractual Obligations**: Enforcing the contract despite the alleged misrepresentations ensures that parties cannot easily escape their contractual obligations, thereby promoting certainty and reliability in commercial transactions.

2. **Encouraging Due Diligence**: By requiring clear and unequivocal rescission, the court encourages parties to promptly address any issues of misrepresentation, fostering a more diligent and proactive approach to contract management.

3. **Preventing Unwarranted Claims**: Ensuring that misrepresentation claims are substantiated with precise factual evidence prevents frivolous or belated claims, thereby protecting the integrity of the judicial process.

Therefore, given the shared fact patterns and the underlying values and principles of the law, the court should reach the same outcome as in LEUNG CHI KIN TERENCE v. ECOSUCCESS LTD, requiring Nick to demonstrate a clear and unequivocal act of rescission and provide precise factual evidence of the misrepresentations to terminate the contract and recover potential damages.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **LEUNG CHI KIN TERENCE v. ECOSUCCESS LTD**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of an **indemnity clause** (Clause 9(c)). This indemnity clause was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as upholding contractual obligations and ensuring certainty in commercial transactions, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided a clear mechanism for liability even if the principal obligation was unenforceable. However, in our current case, this crucial **indemnity clause** is notably absent as there is no similar provision in the contract between Nick and Tony that would make Tony liable for any misrepresentations or breaches of contract terms.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor **(Nick's reliance on specific environmental standards)** that was not present in **LEUNG CHI KIN TERENCE v. ECOSUCCESS LTD**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because Nick's business model and reputation are heavily dependent on adhering to strict environmental standards. Due to **Nick's reliance on specific environmental standards**, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as **damage to Nick's business reputation and potential loss of market credibility** than positive ones, unlike in **LEUNG CHI KIN TERENCE v. ECOSUCCESS LTD** because the precedent case did not involve such a critical reliance on specific standards that directly impact the core of the business.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from **LEUNG CHI KIN TERENCE v. ECOSUCCESS LTD** should be stated as: "When both [the party alleging misrepresentation continues to act under the contract without clear and unequivocal rescission] and [the contract includes an indemnity clause that ensures liability despite unenforceability of the principal obligation] are present, the court should decide [to uphold the contract and enforce the obligations]." Omitting [the indemnity clause] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of parties being able to escape their contractual obligations based on unproven or belatedly asserted misrepresentations, thereby undermining the certainty and reliability of commercial transactions]. Indeed, the opinion in **LEUNG CHI KIN TERENCE v. ECOSUCCESS LTD** explicitly states that the indemnity clause was crucial to their decision, as it provided a clear mechanism for liability even if the principal obligation was unenforceable.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in **LEUNG CHI KIN TERENCE v. ECOSUCCESS LTD** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties avoiding their contractual obligations based on unproven or belatedly asserted misrepresentations, thereby promoting certainty and reliability in commercial transactions]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [this specific undesirable consequence occurring] because Nick's reliance on specific environmental standards is a critical aspect of his business model and reputation. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should consider the unique reliance on environmental standards and the absence of an indemnity clause, which significantly alters the context and potential consequences of the decision.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction

While it's true that our case lacks the indemnity clause, which was present in the precedent case **LEUNG CHI KIN TERENCE v. ECOSUCCESS LTD**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of misrepresentation and contract affirmation would lead to the undesirable consequence of parties being able to escape their contractual obligations based on unproven or belatedly asserted misrepresentations, thereby undermining the certainty and reliability of commercial transactions. Conversely, not requiring the indemnity clause would allow for the desirable outcome of upholding contractual obligations and ensuring that parties cannot easily avoid their responsibilities, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, such as promoting certainty, reliability, and fairness in commercial dealings.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution

Although our case lacks the indemnity clause, which was present in **LEUNG CHI KIN TERENCE v. ECOSUCCESS LTD**, we have the additional factor of Nick's reliance on specific environmental standards. This reliance on environmental standards, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of misrepresentation and contract affirmation, serves a similar function to the indemnity clause in the precedent case. Given the presence of Nick's reliance on environmental standards, we submit that the reasoning in **LEUNG CHI KIN TERENCE v. ECOSUCCESS LTD** still applies, as the positive effects on promoting certainty, reliability, and fairness in commercial transactions would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **LEUNG CHI KIN TERENCE v. ECOSUCCESS LTD**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of alleged misrepresentations and the continuation of contract performance without clear and unequivocal rescission. However, it also differs significantly in two crucial aspects: the absence of an indemnity clause in the current case and Nick's reliance on specific environmental standards, which is central to his business model and reputation.

The proposed legal rule from **LEUNG CHI KIN TERENCE v. ECOSUCCESS LTD**—that a contract remains enforceable unless there is a clear and unequivocal act of rescission, even in the presence of alleged misrepresentations—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially given the unique reliance on environmental standards in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that upholding contractual obligations promotes certainty and reliability in commercial transactions (as argued in the precedent case) and the counterpoint that Nick's business reputation and market credibility are heavily dependent on adherence to specific environmental standards (a factor absent in the precedent case).

Considering the underlying legal principles of promoting certainty, reliability, and fairness in commercial dealings, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Nick should be allowed to terminate the contract and seek potential damages. This decision is influenced by the unique reliance on environmental standards, which significantly alters the context and potential consequences of the decision. The absence of an indemnity clause further supports this conclusion, as it removes a key mechanism for ensuring liability despite unenforceability of the principal obligation.

Therefore, Nick can rescind the contract based on Tony's misrepresentations and seek potential damages, provided he can demonstrate a clear and unequivocal act of rescission and provide precise factual evidence of the misrepresentations. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency, particularly in cases where specific standards are critical to the business model and reputation of the parties involved.

### Minor Premise:

1. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 5:
   - Nick and Tony have made a contract for the supply of wood and finishes.
   - Tony is acting in the course of his business.
   - Therefore, there is an implied term that Tony will carry out the service with reasonable care and skill.

2. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 6 Subsection 1:
   - The time for the service to be carried out is fixed by the contract.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

3. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 7 Subsection 1:
   - The consideration for the service is determined by the contract.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

4. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 8 Subsection 1:
   - Nick is not dealing as a consumer.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

5. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 8 Subsection 2:

   - The implied term that Tony will carry out the service with reasonable care and skill may be negatived or varied by express agreement, or by the course of dealing between the parties, or by such usage as binds both parties to the contract.
   - There is no express agreement or course of dealing that negates or varies this implied term.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

6. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 8 Subsection 3:
   - The contract includes express terms regarding the duration, delivery dates, amounts, price, and wood type.
   - The express terms do not negative the implied term that Tony will carry out the service with reasonable care and skill, as they are not inconsistent with it.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

### Conclusion:

Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 5 applies, and there is an implied term that Tony will carry out the service with reasonable care and skill. Tony's failure to supply locally sourced wood and plant-based varnishes and paints constitutes a breach of this implied term. Nick is entitled to terminate the contract and seek damages for any losses incurred due to Tony's breach.

### Minor Premise:

1. Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v. West Bromwich Building Society [1998] 1 WLR 896:
   - The contract between Nick and Tony is of a kind and specificity that requires interpretation.
   - A reasonable person with all the background knowledge available to Nick and Tony at the time of the contract would understand that Nick's business depends on his reputation as an ethical builder and that all wood must be locally sourced and all varnishes and paints must be plant-based.
   - The background includes Nick's discussions with Tony about the importance of sourcing and paint/varnish requirements.
   - However, the background does not include previous negotiations and declarations of subjective intent.

2. Kensland Realty Ltd v Whale View Investment Ltd [2001] 2 HKLRD 342:

### Conclusion:

The conditions for implying terms into the contract are satisfied, and the court may imply the terms that all wood must be locally sourced and all varnishes and paints must be plant-based. Therefore, Nick can terminate the contract and seek damages for Tony's breach of these implied terms.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (RE SILVER BASE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CO LTD)

In the case of RE SILVER BASE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CO LTD (precedent p), the court dealt with a winding-up petition based on a dishonoured cheque. The company argued that it had a cross-claim against the petitioner, which should offset the debt. The court ruled that the company must demonstrate a bona fide dispute on substantial grounds or special circumstances to deny the petitioner's entitlement to payment. The court found no such grounds and ordered a winding-up of the company (outcome o).

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in RE SILVER BASE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CO LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Implied Terms in Contracts**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In RE SILVER BASE, the court considered whether there were implied terms that could affect the enforceability of the debt. Similarly, in our current case, the issue is whether the implied terms regarding the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints affect the enforceability of the contract.

- **Legal Concept 2: Bona Fide Dispute on Substantial Grounds**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In RE SILVER BASE, the company needed to show a bona fide dispute on substantial grounds to avoid payment. In our current case, Nick needs to establish that there is a substantial breach of implied terms to justify terminating the contract and seeking damages.

- **Legal Concept 3: Special Circumstances**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: The court in RE SILVER BASE considered whether there were special circumstances that would justify not paying the debt. In our current case, the special circumstances would be Tony's deviation from the agreed ethical sourcing and use of plant-based materials, which are critical to Nick's business.

- **Legal Concept 4: Contractual Silence and Implied Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In RE SILVER BASE, the court looked at the silence in the contract regarding certain terms and whether they could be implied. Similarly, in our current case, the contract is silent on the sourcing and type of varnishes and paints, and we need to determine if these terms can be implied based on the discussions and the nature of Nick's business.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (RE SILVER BASE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CO LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern involving implied terms in a contract, the court should decide based on whether there is a bona fide dispute on substantial grounds or special circumstances that justify the implied terms. This rule was justified in RE SILVER BASE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CO LTD because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that parties adhere to the implied terms and the underlying values of the contract (such as ethical sourcing and environmental compliance) outweigh the negative effects (E-) of enforcing strict contractual silence.

In our current case, Nick can argue that the implied terms regarding the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints are critical to his business and were clearly communicated to Tony. The deviation from these terms constitutes a substantial breach, justifying the termination of the contract and the recovery of potential damages.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (RE SILVER BASE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CO LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Implied Terms in Contracts**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In RE SILVER BASE, the court considered whether there were implied terms that could affect the enforceability of the debt. Similarly, in our current case, the issue is whether the implied terms regarding the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints affect the enforceability of the contract.

- **Legal Concept 2: Bona Fide Dispute on Substantial Grounds**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In RE SILVER BASE, the company needed to show a bona fide dispute on substantial grounds to avoid payment. In our current case, Nick needs to establish that there is a substantial breach of implied terms to justify terminating the contract and seeking damages.

- **Legal Concept 3: Special Circumstances**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: The court in RE SILVER BASE considered whether there were special circumstances that would justify not paying the debt. In our current case, the special circumstances would be Tony's deviation from the agreed ethical sourcing and use of plant-based materials, which are critical to Nick's business.

- **Legal Concept 4: Contractual Silence and Implied Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In RE SILVER BASE, the court looked at the silence in the contract regarding certain terms and whether they could be implied. Similarly, in our current case, the contract is silent on the sourcing and type of varnishes and paints, and we need to determine if these terms can be implied based on the discussions and the nature of Nick's business.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in RE SILVER BASE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CO LTD. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding the Integrity of Implied Terms**: Just as in RE SILVER BASE, recognizing the implied terms in Nick's contract with Tony would uphold the integrity of the contractual agreement, ensuring that the underlying values and principles, such as ethical sourcing and environmental compliance, are respected.

2. **Ensuring Fairness and Equity**: By allowing Nick to terminate the contract and seek damages, the court would ensure fairness and equity, recognizing that Tony's deviation from the agreed terms has a substantial impact on Nick's business and reputation.

3. **Promoting Business Efficacy**: Enforcing the implied terms would promote business efficacy by ensuring that parties adhere to the agreed standards, which are critical for the successful operation of businesses like Nick's that depend on specific ethical and environmental standards.

4. **Deterring Misrepresentation**: This decision would also serve as a deterrent against misrepresentation and non-compliance with agreed terms, encouraging businesses to be transparent and honest in their dealings.

Therefore, given the shared fact patterns and the positive effects of upholding the implied terms, the court should allow Nick to terminate the contract and recover potential damages, just as it did in RE SILVER BASE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CO LTD.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **RE SILVER BASE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CO LTD**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of a **dishonoured cheque** as the basis for the petition debt. The dishonoured cheque was a clear, undisputed debt that provided a straightforward basis for the winding-up petition. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as upholding the integrity of financial obligations and ensuring prompt payment of debts, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided a clear and unambiguous ground for the court's decision.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of a **dishonoured cheque** is notably absent. Instead, the dispute revolves around the implied terms regarding the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints, which are not explicitly mentioned in the written contract. This absence of a clear, undisputed debt makes the situation more complex and less straightforward than in the precedent case.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor of **ethical and environmental compliance** that was not present in **RE SILVER BASE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CO LTD**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the entire business model of Nick depends on maintaining strict ethical and environmental standards. Due to this factor, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as damaging Nick's business reputation and undermining the trust of his customers, than positive ones, unlike in **RE SILVER BASE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CO LTD**. The ethical and environmental compliance is a critical aspect of Nick's business, and any deviation from these standards has far-reaching implications that were not considered in the precedent case.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from **RE SILVER BASE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CO LTD** should be stated as: "When both [the presence of implied terms in a contract] and [the critical importance of ethical and environmental compliance to the business] are present, the court should decide [to allow the termination of the contract and recovery of potential damages]." Omitting [the critical importance of ethical and environmental compliance to the business] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of undermining the business's reputation and trust in the marketplace, which is essential for its operation]. Indeed, the opinion in **RE SILVER BASE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CO LTD** explicitly states that the court must consider all relevant circumstances and is not confined to a strict application of legal principles applicable to an ordinary civil action. This highlights the importance of considering the specific context and critical factors relevant to the business in question.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in **RE SILVER BASE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CO LTD** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of unjustly allowing a company to avoid its financial obligations by raising unsubstantiated cross-claims]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [a company avoiding its financial obligations through unsubstantiated claims]. Instead, the risk is [undermining the ethical and environmental standards that are crucial to Nick's business]. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The court should instead focus on the critical importance of the implied terms related to ethical and environmental compliance, which are essential for Nick's business, and allow the termination of the contract and recovery of potential damages.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of a dishonoured cheque, which was present in the precedent case RE SILVER BASE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CO LTD, requiring this factor for all similar cases of implied terms in contracts would lead to the undesirable consequence of limiting the court's ability to address breaches of implied terms that are critical to the business's operation and reputation. Conversely, not requiring the presence of a dishonoured cheque would allow for a more flexible and context-sensitive approach, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, such as fairness, equity, and the protection of legitimate business interests.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of a dishonoured cheque, which was present in RE SILVER BASE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CO LTD, we have the additional factor of ethical and environmental compliance. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of implied terms in contracts, serves a similar function to the dishonoured cheque in the precedent case. Given the presence of ethical and environmental compliance, we submit that the reasoning in RE SILVER BASE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CO LTD still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as upholding the integrity of implied terms, ensuring fairness and equity, promoting business efficacy, and deterring misrepresentation, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **RE SILVER BASE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CO LTD**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the need to consider implied terms in contracts and the importance of bona fide disputes on substantial grounds. However, it also differs significantly in the absence of a dishonoured cheque and the critical importance of ethical and environmental compliance to Nick's business.

The proposed legal rule of allowing the termination of the contract and recovery of potential damages when implied terms are critical to the business finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the court should consider all relevant circumstances and not be confined to strict legal principles (as in **RE SILVER BASE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CO LTD**), and the counterargument that the absence of a dishonoured cheque makes the current case more complex.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, equity, and the protection of legitimate business interests, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Nick should be allowed to terminate the contract and recover potential damages. This decision is justified because the implied terms regarding the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints are critical to Nick's business and were clearly communicated to Tony. The deviation from these terms constitutes a substantial breach, justifying the termination of the contract and the recovery of potential damages.

This conclusion aligns with the legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency, ensuring that businesses can rely on implied terms that are essential to their operation and reputation. The key factors influencing this outcome include the critical importance of ethical and environmental compliance to Nick's business and the need to uphold the integrity of implied terms in contracts.

Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 16 Subsection 3

### Major Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 16 Subsection 3

   Conditions:
   - A seller sells goods in the course of a business
   - The buyer, expressly or by implication, makes known to the seller any particular purpose for which the goods are being bought

   Consequences:
   - There is an implied condition that the goods supplied under the contract are reasonably fit for that purpose, whether or not that is a purpose for which such goods are commonly supplied

   Exceptions:
   - Where the circumstances show that the buyer does not rely, or that it is unreasonable for him to rely, on the seller's skill or judgment

### Minor Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 16 Subsection 3:
- Tony sells wood for floors and cladding in the course of his business.
- Nick, the buyer, expressly made known to Tony that the wood must be locally sourced and the varnishes and paints must be plant-based to maintain his reputation as an ethical builder.
- There is an implied condition that the wood supplied under the contract must be locally sourced and the varnishes and paints must be plant-based, as these are the particular purposes for which the goods are being bought.
- The circumstances do not show that Nick does not rely, or that it is unreasonable for him to rely, on Tony's skill or judgment, as Tony explicitly promised compliance with these requirements.

### Conclusion:

Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 16 Subsection 3 applies, and there is an implied condition that the wood supplied under the contract must be locally sourced and the varnishes and paints must be plant-based. Nick can terminate the contract and seek damages for breach of this implied condition.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS)

In the case of PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS [2021] HKCFI 2539; HCA 1905/2018 (precedent p), the Plaintiff sought damages for misrepresentation and breach of contract related to the supply of marble and incidental services. The Plaintiff alleged defects in the marble, misrepresentation regarding its quality and value, and breach of implied terms that the marble would correspond to the approved sample and be of merchantable quality. The Defendants denied these allegations. The court ruled that expert evidence was necessary to resolve the issues but emphasized the importance of properly framed questions and the necessity of expert evidence to avoid unnecessary costs and time. The court allowed separate experts on defects but required a single joint expert on quantum.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Misrepresentation**: In both cases, there are allegations of misrepresentation regarding the quality and characteristics of the supplied goods. In precedent p, it was about the quality and value of marble; in the current case, it is about the sourcing and type of varnishes and paints.
- **Breach of Contract**: Both cases involve claims of breach of contract. In precedent p, the breach was related to the implied terms that the marble would correspond to the sample and be of merchantable quality. In the current case, the breach concerns the failure to supply locally sourced wood and plant-based varnishes and paints as per the verbal agreement.
- **Implied Terms**: Both cases deal with the issue of implied terms in a contract. In precedent p, the implied terms were that the marble would correspond to the sample and be of merchantable quality. In the current case, the implied terms are that the wood would be locally sourced and the finishes would be plant-based.
- **Expert Evidence**: Both cases require expert evidence to resolve the disputes. In precedent p, expert evidence was needed to determine the defects and quantum of damages. In the current case, expert evidence may be required to assess the environmental impact and quality of the materials supplied.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS)

This suggests a general rule that when we see fact patterns involving misrepresentation, breach of contract, and the necessity of implied terms, the court should decide to allow expert evidence to resolve the disputes. This rule was justified in PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS because the positive effects (E+) of outcome o on the underlying values and principles of the law, such as ensuring fairness, accuracy in the trial process, and preventing unnecessary costs and time, outweigh the negative effects (E-) in that case.

In our current case, applying this rule would mean that Nick should be allowed to terminate the contract and seek damages for misrepresentation and breach of implied terms. Expert evidence should be adduced to determine the environmental impact and quality of the materials supplied, ensuring that the court can effectively resolve the real issues in dispute.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS) are present:

- **Misrepresentation**: In both cases, there are allegations of misrepresentation regarding the quality and characteristics of the supplied goods. In the precedent, it was about the quality and value of marble; in the current case, it is about the sourcing and type of varnishes and paints.
- **Breach of Contract**: Both cases involve claims of breach of contract. In the precedent, the breach was related to the implied terms that the marble would correspond to the sample and be of merchantable quality. In the current case, the breach concerns the failure to supply locally sourced wood and plant-based varnishes and paints as per the verbal agreement.
- **Implied Terms**: Both cases deal with the issue of implied terms in a contract. In the precedent, the implied terms were that the marble would correspond to the sample and be of merchantable quality. In the current case, the implied terms are that the wood would be locally sourced and the finishes would be plant-based.
- **Expert Evidence**: Both cases require expert evidence to resolve the disputes. In the precedent, expert evidence was needed to determine the defects and quantum of damages. In the current case, expert evidence may be required to assess the environmental impact and quality of the materials supplied.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Fairness**: Allowing Nick to terminate the contract and seek damages would ensure that parties are held accountable for their representations and promises, especially when these are crucial to the other party's business model and reputation.
2. **Accuracy in the Trial Process**: Adducing expert evidence to determine the environmental impact and quality of the materials supplied would provide the court with the necessary information to make an informed decision, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the trial process.
3. **Preventing Unnecessary Costs and Time**: By properly framing the questions for the experts and ensuring that the expert evidence is relevant and necessary, the court can avoid unnecessary costs and time, which aligns with the principles of procedural economy and cost-effectiveness.

Therefore, given the shared fact patterns and the positive effects on the underlying values and principles of the law, the court should allow Nick to terminate the contract and seek damages, and should also permit the adduction of expert evidence to resolve the disputes effectively.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of **expert evidence**. Expert evidence was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as **ensuring fairness, accuracy in the trial process, and preventing unnecessary costs and time**, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided the court with the necessary information to make an informed decision on the defects and quantum of damages.

However, in our current case, this crucial **expert evidence** is notably absent as there has been no mention or indication that expert evidence has been sought or considered to determine the environmental impact and quality of the materials supplied by Tony. Without expert evidence, it may be challenging to substantiate claims regarding the environmental impact and the quality of the materials, which are central to Nick's case.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor **(the specific environmental and ethical requirements of the materials)** that was not present in **PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because Nick's business model and reputation are heavily dependent on the environmental and ethical sourcing of materials. Due to this factor, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as **potential damage to Nick's business reputation and loss of credibility in the eco home pod marketplace** than positive ones, unlike in **PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS** because the precedent case did not involve such specific and critical business requirements tied to the nature of the materials supplied.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS** should be stated as: "When both [misrepresentation and breach of contract involving implied terms] and [the necessity of expert evidence to resolve the disputes] are present, the court should decide [to allow the termination of the contract and the seeking of damages, and permit the adduction of expert evidence]." Omitting [the necessity of expert evidence to resolve the disputes] from this rule could lead to [an undesirable consequence where the court makes a decision without sufficient information, potentially leading to an unfair outcome and unnecessary costs and time]. Indeed, the opinion in **PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS** explicitly states that [expert evidence was crucial to their decision, as it provided the necessary information to make an informed decision on the defects and quantum of damages].

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of the court making a decision without sufficient information, leading to an unfair outcome and unnecessary costs and time]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [the court making a decision without sufficient information] occurring because the specific environmental and ethical requirements of the materials are central to Nick's business model and reputation, and these requirements are clear and undisputed. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should focus on the specific environmental and ethical requirements that were verbally agreed upon, even though they were not explicitly stated in the written contract. This approach would ensure fairness and uphold the integrity of Nick's business model.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the explicit presence of expert evidence, which was present in the precedent case **PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of misrepresentation and breach of contract involving implied terms would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would mean that parties who have clear and undisputed verbal agreements regarding critical business requirements, such as environmental and ethical standards, would be unable to seek redress simply because these agreements were not explicitly stated in the written contract. Conversely, not requiring expert evidence in such cases would allow for a more just and equitable outcome, ensuring that parties are held accountable for their representations and promises, especially when these are crucial to the other party's business model and reputation. This approach better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, which include fairness, accountability, and the protection of business integrity.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the explicit presence of expert evidence, which was present in **PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS**, we have the additional factor of the specific environmental and ethical requirements of the materials, which are central to Nick's business model and reputation. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of misrepresentation and breach of contract involving implied terms, serves a similar function to expert evidence in the precedent case. Given the presence of this critical business requirement, we submit that the reasoning in **PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS** still applies. The positive effects on relevant legal values, such as ensuring fairness, upholding business integrity, and protecting reputations, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. Therefore, the court should allow Nick to terminate the contract and seek damages, ensuring that the specific environmental and ethical requirements are upheld.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **PERPETUAL WEALTH (HONG KONG) LTD v. BE SOLUTIONS CO LTD AND OTHERS**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as allegations of misrepresentation, breach of contract, and the necessity of implied terms. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of expert evidence and the specific environmental and ethical requirements central to Nick's business model.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case suggests that when both misrepresentation and breach of contract involving implied terms are present, and expert evidence is necessary to resolve the disputes, the court should allow the termination of the contract and the seeking of damages, and permit the adduction of expert evidence. This rule finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered.

We've weighed arguments from both sides. A strong point from the initial analogy is that the precedent emphasizes the importance of expert evidence in ensuring fairness and accuracy in the trial process. On the other hand, a compelling counterargument is that requiring expert evidence in all similar cases could lead to unjust outcomes, particularly when clear and undisputed verbal agreements regarding critical business requirements are present.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, accountability, and the protection of business integrity, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the court should allow Nick to terminate the contract and seek damages. This decision aligns with the precedent's emphasis on ensuring fairness and upholding business integrity, even though the specific environmental and ethical requirements were not explicitly stated in the written contract. The court should also permit the adduction of expert evidence to assess the environmental impact and quality of the materials supplied, ensuring that the real issues in dispute are effectively resolved.

Therefore, the final decision is that Nick should be allowed to terminate the contract and seek damages for misrepresentation and breach of implied terms, with expert evidence being adduced to determine the environmental impact and quality of the materials supplied. This approach ensures a just and equitable outcome, upholding the principles of fairness and accountability in contractual relationships.


# Contract Law: Whether Nick's reliance on Tony's promises about the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints can give rise to an estoppel preventing Tony from denying these promises

   Exceptions:
   - None

5. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 8 Subsections 2 and 3

   Conditions:
   - A right, duty or liability would arise under a contract for the supply of a service by virtue of this Ordinance
   - The parties attempt to negative or vary this right, duty or liability by express agreement, or by the course of dealing between the parties, or by such usage as binds both parties to the contract

   Consequences:
   - The right, duty or liability may be negatived or varied

   Exceptions:
   - The party to a contract for the supply of a service deals as consumer
   - The express term is inconsistent with the term implied by this Ordinance

### Minor Premise:

1. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 5:
   - Nick and Tony have a contract for the supply of a service (supply of wood and finishes).
   - Tony is acting in the course of his business.
   - Therefore, there is an implied term that Tony will carry out the service with reasonable care and skill.

2. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 6 Subsection 1:
   - The time for the service to be carried out is fixed by the contract (delivery dates specified).
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

3. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 7 Subsection 1:
   - The consideration for the service is determined by the contract (price specified).
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

4. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 8 Subsection 1:
   - Nick is not dealing as a consumer; he is a business.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

5. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 8 Subsections 2 and 3:
   - A right, duty or liability would arise under the contract by virtue of this Ordinance (reasonable care and skill).
   - The parties have not attempted to negative or vary this right, duty or liability by express agreement, or by the course of dealing between the parties, or by such usage as binds both parties to the contract.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

### Conclusion:

Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 5 applies, and there is an implied term that Tony will carry out the service with reasonable care and skill. Tony's failure to supply locally sourced wood and plant-based finishes as promised constitutes a breach of this implied term. Nick can terminate the contract and seek damages for any losses incurred due to Tony's breach.

## Deductive Reasoning: ca

### Relevant law:

NG YUK PUI KELLY v. NG LAI LING WINNIE AS THE EXECUTOR OF THE ESTATE OF DUNG WAI MAN, DECEASED AND OTHERS [2021] HKCA 724

### Major Premise:

1. NG YUK PUI KELLY v. NG LAI LING WINNIE AS THE EXECUTOR OF THE ESTATE OF DUNG WAI MAN, DECEASED AND OTHERS [2021] HKCA 724

   Conditions:
   - The parties to a contract agree to a certain state of affairs as the basis for their transaction, whether it be the case or not
   - The agreement is expressed in a contractual document

   Consequences:
   - Neither party can subsequently deny the existence of the facts and matters upon which they have agreed, at least so far as concerns those aspects of their relationship to which the agreement was directed
   - The contract itself gives rise to an estoppel

   Exceptions:
   - The estoppel is sought to be applied beyond the scope agreed upon in the contract
   - The contract has been discharged and the agreement in the contractual provisions is spent

### Minor Premise:

1. NG YUK PUI KELLY v. NG LAI LING WINNIE AS THE EXECUTOR OF THE ESTATE OF DUNG WAI MAN, DECEASED AND OTHERS [2021] HKCA 724:
   - Nick and Tony entered into a contract for the supply of wood.
   - The contract specifies the duration, delivery dates, amounts, price, and wood type but is silent on the sourcing and paint/varnish requirements.
   - Nick relied on Tony's promises about the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints, which were discussed but not included in the written contract.
   - Tony supplied wood that was not locally sourced and used chemical-based varnishes and paints, contrary to Nick's expectations based on their discussions.

### Conclusion:

The conditions for estoppel as per NG YUK PUI KELLY v. NG LAI LING WINNIE AS THE EXECUTOR OF THE ESTATE OF DUNG WAI MAN, DECEASED AND OTHERS [2021] HKCA 724 are not fully satisfied because the agreement regarding the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints was not expressed in the contractual document. Therefore, Nick cannot rely on estoppel to prevent Tony from denying these promises. Nick may need to explore other legal remedies such as misrepresentation or breach of implied terms, but estoppel does not apply in this case.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣)

In the case of GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣 [2023] HKCFI 1539; HCA 13/2022 (precedent p), the defendant (D) admitted liability to pay RMB 55,000,000 plus interest but contested the remaining claim of RMB 167,200,000. The plaintiff (P) sought summary judgment for the total sum, arguing that the defences of estoppel and force majeure put forward by D were not arguable. The court ruled that the estoppel defence was unarguable because there was no clear and unequivocal promise from P not to enforce its rights, and the force majeure defence was also unarguable as the adverse impact on the Target Company did not constitute force majeure events under the contract. The court granted summary judgment in favour of P.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Estoppel**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the defendant relied on representations made by the plaintiff or its representative. In precedent p, D relied on representations by Yang that the proceedings would be suspended. In the current case, Nick relied on Tony's promises regarding the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints.

- **Legal Concept 2: Clear and Unequivocal Promise**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: The court in precedent p required a clear and unequivocal promise for estoppel to apply. In the current case, Nick would need to show that Tony made a clear and unequivocal promise about the sourcing and type of materials.

- **Legal Concept 3: Authority to Bind**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In precedent p, the court examined whether Yang had the authority to bind P. Similarly, in the current case, it would be relevant to consider whether Tony had the authority to make binding promises on behalf of his business.

- **Legal Concept 4: Detrimental Reliance**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In precedent p, D needed to show that he acted to his detriment based on the representations. In the current case, Nick would need to demonstrate that he relied on Tony's promises to his detriment, such as by continuing to use Tony's supplies under the belief they met his environmental standards.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a party relying on representations made by another party, the court should decide that estoppel applies only if there is a clear and unequivocal promise, the person making the promise has the authority to bind the party, and the relying party has acted to their detriment based on the promise. This rule was justified in GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that only clear and unequivocal promises with proper authority can bind a party outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially allowing parties to escape liability based on informal or unauthorized representations. This promotes certainty and fairness in contractual relationships.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Estoppel**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, the defendant relied on representations made by the plaintiff or its representative. In precedent p, D relied on representations by Yang that the proceedings would be suspended. In the current case, Nick relied on Tony's promises regarding the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints.

- **Legal Concept 2: Clear and Unequivocal Promise**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: The court in precedent p required a clear and unequivocal promise for estoppel to apply. In the current case, Nick would need to show that Tony made a clear and unequivocal promise about the sourcing and type of materials.

- **Legal Concept 3: Authority to Bind**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In precedent p, the court examined whether Yang had the authority to bind P. Similarly, in the current case, it would be relevant to consider whether Tony had the authority to make binding promises on behalf of his business.

- **Legal Concept 4: Detrimental Reliance**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In precedent p, D needed to show that he acted to his detriment based on the representations. In the current case, Nick would need to demonstrate that he relied on Tony's promises to his detriment, such as by continuing to use Tony's supplies under the belief they met his environmental standards.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Promoting Certainty and Fairness in Contractual Relationships**: Ensuring that only clear and unequivocal promises with proper authority can bind a party promotes certainty and fairness. This prevents parties from escaping liability based on informal or unauthorized representations, which is crucial for maintaining trust and reliability in business transactions.

2. **Encouraging Proper Documentation and Formal Agreements**: By requiring clear and unequivocal promises, the court encourages parties to document their agreements formally. This reduces the likelihood of disputes arising from misunderstandings or informal assurances, thereby fostering a more stable and predictable business environment.

3. **Protecting Parties from Unwarranted Claims**: The requirement for detrimental reliance ensures that parties are protected from unwarranted claims based on alleged representations that did not cause any actual harm. This aligns with the principle of fairness and prevents abuse of the estoppel doctrine.

Therefore, applying the same rule from the precedent case to the current case would ensure that Nick can only rely on Tony's promises if they were clear, unequivocal, and made with proper authority, and if Nick acted to his detriment based on those promises. This approach upholds the integrity of contractual relationships and promotes a fair and predictable legal environment.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case

In the precedent case **GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the factor of **clear and unequivocal promise**. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as promoting certainty and fairness in contractual relationships, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it prevented parties from escaping liability based on informal or unauthorized representations. However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as the written agreement between Nick and Tony is silent on the sourcing and paint/varnish requirements. Therefore, there is no clear and unequivocal promise documented in the contract that Tony would only supply locally sourced wood and plant-based varnishes and paints.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case

Our current case involves an important factor **(Nick's reliance on Tony's oral promises)** that was not present in **GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because Nick's business model and reputation heavily depend on the environmental standards promised by Tony. Due to this reliance, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as damaging Nick's business reputation and credibility in the eco home pod marketplace than positive ones, unlike in **GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣**. In the precedent case, the court did not have to consider the impact on a party's business reputation and market position, which are crucial in Nick's case. Therefore, the presence of Nick's reliance on Tony's oral promises significantly changes the balance of positive and negative effects, making the application of the same outcome inappropriate.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from **GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣** should be stated as: "When both [the defendant relied on representations made by the plaintiff or its representative] and [the representations were clear and unequivocal promises with proper authority] are present, the court should decide [that estoppel applies]." Omitting [the representations were clear and unequivocal promises with proper authority] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q], which is the potential for parties to escape liability based on informal or unauthorized representations, thereby undermining the certainty and fairness in contractual relationships. Indeed, the opinion in **GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣** explicitly states that [the need for clear and unequivocal promises with proper authority] was crucial to their decision, as evidenced by the court's detailed examination of whether Yang had the authority to bind P and whether the promises were clear and unequivocal.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in **GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties escaping liability based on informal or unauthorized representations]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [this specific undesirable consequence] occurring because Nick's reliance on Tony's oral promises about the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints is directly tied to the core of his business model and reputation. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should consider the significant detrimental reliance by Nick on Tony's promises, which were crucial for maintaining his business's credibility and market position. This reliance should be sufficient to establish estoppel, even if the promises were not documented in the written agreement.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction

While it's true that our case lacks the clear and unequivocal promise documented in the written agreement, which was present in the precedent case **GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of reliance on representations would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would allow parties to escape liability for oral promises that were crucial to the other party's business operations and reputation, thereby undermining trust and reliability in business transactions. Conversely, not requiring a documented clear and unequivocal promise would allow for the protection of parties who have relied on significant oral promises that are central to their business model and reputation. This better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and the protection of legitimate business expectations.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution

Although our case lacks the clear and unequivocal promise documented in the written agreement, which was present in **GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣**, we have the additional factor of Nick's significant detrimental reliance on Tony's oral promises. This detrimental reliance, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of reliance on representations, serves a similar function to the documented promise in the precedent case. Given the presence of Nick's detrimental reliance, we submit that the reasoning in **GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣** still applies, as the positive effects on promoting fairness and protecting legitimate business expectations would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as reliance on representations made by the other party and the need for a clear and unequivocal promise. However, it also differs significantly in that the written agreement between Nick and Tony is silent on the sourcing and paint/varnish requirements, and Nick's business model and reputation heavily depend on these environmental standards.

The proposed legal rule from **GREAT PACIFIC INVESTMENTS LTD v. 张华荣** requires a clear and unequivocal promise with proper authority for estoppel to apply. This rule finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the need for clear and unequivocal promises to promote certainty and fairness in contractual relationships (a strong point from the precedent) and the significant detrimental reliance by Nick on Tony's oral promises, which are crucial for maintaining his business's credibility and market position (a strong point from the current case).

Considering the underlying legal principles of promoting fairness, protecting legitimate business expectations, and ensuring trust and reliability in business transactions, we conclude that Nick's reliance on Tony's oral promises should be sufficient to establish estoppel, even if the promises were not documented in the written agreement. This decision aligns with the principle of fairness and the protection of legitimate business expectations, as Nick's business reputation and market position are significantly impacted by Tony's failure to comply with the promised environmental standards.

Therefore, Nick should be entitled to terminate the contract and recover potential damages based on the detrimental reliance on Tony's oral promises. This approach ensures that parties cannot escape liability for significant oral promises that are central to the other party's business operations and reputation, thereby upholding trust and reliability in business transactions.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (ABLE ENGINEERING CO LTD v. WELMETAL RESOURCES GROUP LTD)

In the case of ABLE ENGINEERING CO LTD v. WELMETAL RESOURCES GROUP LTD (precedent p), the plaintiff, Able Engineering, sought summary judgment against the defendant, Welmetal Resources, for breach of contract due to non-payment within the stipulated time. The court ruled that the defendant had an express right to terminate the contract due to the plaintiff's failure to make timely payments as specified in the contract. The court dismissed the plaintiff's action and upheld the defendant's right to terminate the contract, emphasizing that the express termination clause in the contract was valid and enforceable.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in ABLE ENGINEERING CO LTD v. WELMETAL RESOURCES GROUP LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Express Termination Clause**: In ABLE ENGINEERING, the contract contained an express clause allowing termination for non-payment within 30 days. In our current case, while there is no express clause regarding sourcing and paint/varnish requirements, the principle of express terms governing termination is relevant.
- **Breach of Contract**: In ABLE ENGINEERING, the breach was non-payment. In our current case, the breach involves the use of non-local wood and chemical-based varnishes, which contradicts the implied terms based on the discussions and the nature of Nick's business.
- **Fundamental Breach**: In ABLE ENGINEERING, the court considered whether the breach was fundamental enough to justify termination. Similarly, in our current case, we need to determine if the breach of the implied terms is fundamental enough to justify termination.
- **Implied Terms**: While ABLE ENGINEERING dealt with express terms, the concept of implied terms is relevant in our case, as the sourcing and paint/varnish requirements were implied based on the pre-contractual discussions and the nature of Nick's business.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (ABLE ENGINEERING CO LTD v. WELMETAL RESOURCES GROUP LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see a breach of an express or implied term that is fundamental to the contract, the court should decide that the innocent party is entitled to terminate the contract. This rule was justified in ABLE ENGINEERING CO LTD v. WELMETAL RESOURCES GROUP LTD because the express termination clause provided clear grounds for termination, and the breach was significant enough to undermine the contractual relationship.

Applying this rule to our current case, the implied terms regarding the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints are fundamental to Nick's business and were clearly communicated to Tony. The breach of these terms by Tony, by supplying non-local wood and chemical-based varnishes, undermines the core values and reputation of Nick's business. Therefore, Nick should be entitled to terminate the contract and seek potential damages for the breach of these fundamental implied terms.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (ABLE ENGINEERING CO LTD v. WELMETAL RESOURCES GROUP LTD) are present:

- **Express Termination Clause**: While the current case does not have an express termination clause regarding the sourcing and paint/varnish requirements, the principle of express terms governing termination is relevant. The precedent case emphasized the importance of express terms in determining the right to terminate.
- **Breach of Contract**: In ABLE ENGINEERING, the breach was non-payment. In our current case, the breach involves the use of non-local wood and chemical-based varnishes, which contradicts the implied terms based on the discussions and the nature of Nick's business.
- **Fundamental Breach**: In ABLE ENGINEERING, the court considered whether the breach was fundamental enough to justify termination. Similarly, in our current case, we need to determine if the breach of the implied terms is fundamental enough to justify termination.
- **Implied Terms**: While ABLE ENGINEERING dealt with express terms, the concept of implied terms is relevant in our case, as the sourcing and paint/varnish requirements were implied based on the pre-contractual discussions and the nature of Nick's business.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome: allowing Nick to terminate the contract and seek potential damages. This decision would be justified because, as in ABLE ENGINEERING CO LTD v. WELMETAL RESOURCES GROUP LTD, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Contractual Integrity**: Just as in the precedent case, enforcing the right to terminate for a fundamental breach ensures that parties adhere to the core terms of their agreements, whether express or implied. This maintains the integrity of contractual obligations and promotes trust in commercial transactions.

2. **Protecting Business Reputation**: In the current case, Nick's business reputation as an ethical builder is paramount. Allowing termination for the breach of implied terms related to sourcing and paint/varnish requirements protects Nick's business from reputational damage, which is crucial for his market position.

3. **Encouraging Honest Dealings**: By upholding the right to terminate for fundamental breaches, the court would encourage parties to be honest and transparent in their dealings. This aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and good faith in contract law.

4. **Preventing Future Disputes**: As noted in the precedent case, clear provisions for termination prevent disputes over whether a breach is sufficiently serious to justify termination. This clarity benefits both parties by providing a predictable legal framework.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in ABLE ENGINEERING CO LTD v. WELMETAL RESOURCES GROUP LTD, it would uphold the integrity of contractual obligations, protect business reputations, encourage honest dealings, and prevent future disputes.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case ABLE ENGINEERING CO LTD v. WELMETAL RESOURCES GROUP LTD, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of an express termination clause. This express termination clause was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as upholding contractual integrity and providing clear grounds for termination, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided a clear and unequivocal basis for the defendant to terminate the contract upon the plaintiff's breach. However, in our current case, this crucial express termination clause is notably absent as the contract between Nick and Tony does not explicitly state the sourcing and paint/varnish requirements or provide a clear termination clause for breaches related to these implied terms.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the implied terms regarding the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints, that was not present in ABLE ENGINEERING CO LTD v. WELMETAL RESOURCES GROUP LTD. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the implied terms are based on pre-contractual discussions and the nature of Nick's business, which were not considerations in the precedent case. Due to the presence of these implied terms, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the trust and reliance on pre-contractual representations and damaging Nick's business reputation, unlike in ABLE ENGINEERING CO LTD v. WELMETAL RESOURCES GROUP LTD because the precedent case dealt with clear express terms and did not involve the same level of reliance on implied terms critical to the business's core values.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from ABLE ENGINEERING CO LTD v. WELMETAL RESOURCES GROUP LTD should be stated as "When both [a fundamental breach of an express or implied term] and [the term being crucial to the core business values or pre-contractual representations] are present, the court should decide [that the innocent party is entitled to terminate the contract and seek potential damages]." Omitting [the term being crucial to the core business values or pre-contractual representations] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of undermining the trust and reliance on pre-contractual representations, damaging the business reputation, and failing to protect the core values of a business]. Indeed, the opinion in ABLE ENGINEERING CO LTD v. WELMETAL RESOURCES GROUP LTD explicitly states that the express termination clause was crucial to their decision, highlighting the importance of clear terms in determining the right to terminate.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in ABLE ENGINEERING CO LTD v. WELMETAL RESOURCES GROUP LTD was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties being unable to terminate a contract despite a significant breach due to the absence of clear termination clauses]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [parties being unable to terminate a contract due to the absence of clear termination clauses] because the implied terms regarding the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints are fundamental to Nick's business and were clearly communicated to Tony. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the focus should be on the fundamental nature of the implied terms and their importance to the core values and reputation of Nick's business.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks an express termination clause, which was present in the precedent case ABLE ENGINEERING CO LTD v. WELMETAL RESOURCES GROUP LTD, requiring this factor for all similar cases of fundamental breaches would lead to the undesirable consequence of undermining the trust and reliance on pre-contractual representations. Conversely, not requiring an express termination clause would allow for the protection of business reputations and the enforcement of implied terms that are crucial to the core values of a business. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which include fairness, good faith, and the protection of legitimate business expectations.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks an express termination clause, which was present in ABLE ENGINEERING CO LTD v. WELMETAL RESOURCES GROUP LTD, we have the additional factor of pre-contractual representations and the fundamental nature of the implied terms regarding the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of a fundamental breach, serves a similar function to the express termination clause in the precedent case. Given the presence of these pre-contractual representations and the fundamental nature of the implied terms, we submit that the reasoning in ABLE ENGINEERING CO LTD v. WELMETAL RESOURCES GROUP LTD still applies, as the positive effects on protecting business reputations, enforcing implied terms, and maintaining trust in pre-contractual representations would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to ABLE ENGINEERING CO LTD v. WELMETAL RESOURCES GROUP LTD, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of a fundamental breach and the need to determine whether the breach justifies termination. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of an express termination clause in the current case and the reliance on implied terms based on pre-contractual representations.

The proposed legal rule of allowing termination for a fundamental breach of an express or implied term that is crucial to the core business values or pre-contractual representations finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of express terms in providing clear grounds for termination (as emphasized in the precedent) and the need to protect business reputations and enforce implied terms that are fundamental to the business (as argued in the current case).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, good faith, and the protection of legitimate business expectations, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Nick should be entitled to terminate the contract and seek potential damages. This decision is justified because the implied terms regarding the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints are fundamental to Nick's business and were clearly communicated to Tony. The breach of these terms undermines the core values and reputation of Nick's business, which is crucial for his market position.

Therefore, the absence of an express termination clause should not preclude Nick from terminating the contract, given the fundamental nature of the implied terms and their importance to his business. This approach aligns with the principles of contract law and ensures that pre-contractual representations and core business values are adequately protected.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA009266/1998 BETWEEN LIU SHING WAH ANNA Plaintiff AND LONGKIND PROPERTY LIMITED Defendant)
In the case of HCA009266/1998 BETWEEN LIU SHING WAH ANNA Plaintiff AND LONGKIND PROPERTY LIMITED Defendant (precedent p), the plaintiff sought damages for the defendant's failure to complete a property purchase. The court ruled that the plaintiff could not rely on a liquidated damages clause because it was not a genuine pre-estimate of loss and had not been discussed or agreed upon by the parties. Instead, the plaintiff was required to prove her actual loss and had a duty to mitigate her damages. The court awarded damages based on the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of breach, less any amounts already received.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA009266/1998 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Breach of Contract**: In both cases, the defendant failed to comply with the terms of the contract. In HCA009266/1998, the defendant failed to complete the property purchase. In our current case, Tony supplied non-compliant wood and finishes.
- **Liquidated Damages vs. Actual Damages**: In HCA009266/1998, the court found that the liquidated damages clause was not enforceable because it was not a genuine pre-estimate of loss. Similarly, in our current case, there is no liquidated damages clause, so Nick must prove his actual damages.
- **Duty to Mitigate**: In HCA009266/1998, the plaintiff had a duty to mitigate her losses by taking reasonable steps to sell the property. In our current case, Nick will also have a duty to mitigate his losses by seeking alternative suppliers or other reasonable measures.
- **Assessment of Damages**: In HCA009266/1998, damages were assessed based on the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of breach. In our current case, damages would likely be assessed based on the cost difference between compliant and non-compliant materials and any additional costs incurred due to the breach.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA009266/1998)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a breach of contract and the absence of a genuine pre-estimate of loss (fact pattern i*), the court should decide that the plaintiff must prove actual damages and has a duty to mitigate those damages (outcome o). This rule was justified in HCA009266/1998 because it ensures that damages awarded are fair and reflective of the actual loss suffered, rather than an arbitrary or punitive amount. This approach aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which aim to compensate the injured party for their actual loss while encouraging reasonable behavior to minimize that loss.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA009266/1998 BETWEEN LIU SHING WAH ANNA Plaintiff AND LONGKIND PROPERTY LIMITED Defendant) are present:

- **Breach of Contract**: In both cases, the defendant failed to comply with the terms of the contract. In HCA009266/1998, the defendant failed to complete the property purchase. In our current case, Tony supplied non-compliant wood and finishes.
- **Liquidated Damages vs. Actual Damages**: In HCA009266/1998, the court found that the liquidated damages clause was not enforceable because it was not a genuine pre-estimate of loss. Similarly, in our current case, there is no liquidated damages clause, so Nick must prove his actual damages.
- **Duty to Mitigate**: In HCA009266/1998, the plaintiff had a duty to mitigate her losses by taking reasonable steps to sell the property. In our current case, Nick will also have a duty to mitigate his losses by seeking alternative suppliers or other reasonable measures.
- **Assessment of Damages**: In HCA009266/1998, damages were assessed based on the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of breach. In our current case, damages would likely be assessed based on the cost difference between compliant and non-compliant materials and any additional costs incurred due to the breach.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome: Nick must prove his actual damages and has a duty to mitigate those damages. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA009266/1998, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Fair Compensation**: Ensuring that damages awarded are fair and reflective of the actual loss suffered, rather than an arbitrary or punitive amount.
2. **Encouragement of Reasonable Behavior**: Encouraging parties to take reasonable steps to minimize their losses, which aligns with the principles of contract law.
3. **Consistency in Legal Application**: Applying the same legal principles consistently across similar cases, which promotes predictability and stability in the law.
4. **Economic Efficiency**: Encouraging efficient breach and mitigation behavior, which can lead to better allocation of resources and overall economic efficiency.

Therefore, the court should require Nick to prove his actual damages and demonstrate that he has taken reasonable steps to mitigate his losses, just as it did in the precedent case.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA009266/1998 BETWEEN LIU SHING WAH ANNA Plaintiff AND LONGKIND PROPERTY LIMITED Defendant, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the liquidated damages clause was not a genuine pre-estimate of loss and had not been discussed or agreed upon by the parties. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—fair compensation and encouragement of reasonable behavior—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it ensured that damages awarded were reflective of the actual loss suffered and not arbitrary or punitive. However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as there is no liquidated damages clause at all. The contract between Nick and Tony is silent on the specific requirements for sourcing and paint/varnish, which means there is no pre-determined sum for damages that could be scrutinized for its genuineness as a pre-estimate of loss.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—Nick's explicit communication of his stringent requirements for locally sourced wood and plant-based finishes—that was not present in HCA009266/1998. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces a clear expectation and reliance on specific performance criteria that were communicated and understood by both parties, even though not explicitly written into the contract. Due to this explicit communication, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the importance of verbal agreements and expectations in business dealings, which could lead to a lack of trust and increased disputes over unwritten terms. Unlike in HCA009266/1998, where the focus was on the enforceability of a liquidated damages clause, our case centers on the breach of specific performance criteria that were crucial to Nick's business model and reputation. Therefore, the presence of this factor suggests that Nick should be able to terminate the contract and seek damages based on the breach of these communicated expectations, even if they were not explicitly written into the contract.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA009266/1998 BETWEEN LIU SHING WAH ANNA Plaintiff AND LONGKIND PROPERTY LIMITED Defendant should be stated as: "When both [i*] (breach of contract and absence of a genuine pre-estimate of loss) and [m] (explicit communication of specific performance criteria) are present, the court should decide [o] (the plaintiff must prove actual damages and has a duty to mitigate those damages)." Omitting [m] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q] (undermining the importance of verbal agreements and expectations in business dealings, leading to a lack of trust and increased disputes over unwritten terms). Indeed, the opinion in HCA009266/1998 explicitly states that the absence of a genuine pre-estimate of loss was crucial to their decision, as it ensured that damages awarded were reflective of the actual loss suffered and not arbitrary or punitive.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA009266/1998 was clearly designed to prevent [undesirable consequence u] (awarding arbitrary or punitive damages that do not reflect the actual loss suffered). However, in our current case, there's no risk of [u] occurring because the damages Nick seeks are based on the breach of specific performance criteria that were explicitly communicated and understood by both parties, even though not explicitly written into the contract. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should recognize the importance of the explicit verbal agreements and allow Nick to terminate the contract and seek damages based on the breach of these communicated expectations.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the explicit absence of a genuine pre-estimate of loss (factor m), which was present in the precedent case HCA009266/1998 BETWEEN LIU SHING WAH ANNA Plaintiff AND LONGKIND PROPERTY LIMITED Defendant, requiring this factor for all similar cases of breach of contract and absence of a genuine pre-estimate of loss (fact pattern i*) would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would undermine the importance of verbal agreements and expectations in business dealings, leading to a lack of trust and increased disputes over unwritten terms. Conversely, not requiring the explicit absence of a genuine pre-estimate of loss would allow for the recognition of the significance of verbal agreements and communicated expectations, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, such as the enforcement of fair and reasonable expectations and the promotion of trust in business relationships.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the explicit absence of a genuine pre-estimate of loss (factor m), which was present in HCA009266/1998, we have the additional factor of explicit communication of specific performance criteria (factor n). This explicit communication of specific performance criteria, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of breach of contract and absence of a genuine pre-estimate of loss (fact pattern i*), serves a similar function to the absence of a genuine pre-estimate of loss in the precedent case. Given the presence of explicit communication of specific performance criteria, we submit that the reasoning in HCA009266/1998 still applies, as the positive effects on legal values, such as fair compensation and encouragement of reasonable behavior, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA009266/1998 BETWEEN LIU SHING WAH ANNA Plaintiff AND LONGKIND PROPERTY LIMITED Defendant, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the breach of contract and the absence of a genuine pre-estimate of loss. However, it also differs significantly in that Nick explicitly communicated specific performance criteria to Tony, which were crucial to his business model and reputation.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case—that the plaintiff must prove actual damages and has a duty to mitigate those damages—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the explicit verbal agreements and expectations in our current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides. A strong point from the initial analogy is that it ensures fair compensation and encourages reasonable behavior, aligning with the principles of contract law. On the other hand, the rebuttal effectively highlights the importance of verbal agreements and the potential negative consequences of undermining such expectations in business dealings.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fair compensation, the enforcement of reasonable expectations, and the promotion of trust in business relationships, we conclude that Nick should be able to terminate the contract and seek damages based on the breach of the explicitly communicated performance criteria. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by recognizing the significance of verbal agreements and communicated expectations.

Therefore, Nick must prove his actual damages and demonstrate that he has taken reasonable steps to mitigate his losses. However, given the explicit communication of specific performance criteria, the court should allow Nick to terminate the contract and seek damages based on the breach of these communicated expectations, even if they were not explicitly written into the contract. This approach ensures that the damages awarded are fair and reflective of the actual loss suffered, while also upholding the importance of verbal agreements in business dealings.

### Minor Premise:

1. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 13 Subsection 1:
- The contract between Nick and Tony includes terms that must satisfy the requirement of reasonableness.
- Nick wishes to terminate the contract due to Tony's breach (using non-locally sourced wood and chemical-based varnishes and paints).
- Therefore, the contract term may be found to satisfy the requirement of reasonableness and be given effect accordingly.

2. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 13 Subsection 2:
- The contract between Nick and Tony includes terms that must satisfy the requirement of reasonableness.
- Nick has not affirmed the contract after discovering the breach; he wishes to terminate it.
- Therefore, the requirement of reasonableness in relation to any contract term is not excluded.

3. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 13A Subsection 1 and 2:
- The court may award damages for breach of the contract between Nick and Tony.
- There has been part performance of the contract (three months of supply).
- An order for specific performance (requiring Tony to supply only locally sourced wood and plant-based finishes) could not be made by the court in the circumstances.
- The contract was made after 31 December 1972.
- Therefore, the court may award damages for breach of the contract.

### Conclusion:

Nick can terminate the contract with Tony due to the breach of the terms regarding the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes and paints used. The court may award damages to Nick for the breach of the contract, considering the part performance and the inability to order specific performance.

   - The conduct is inconsistent with the original contract's implied terms regarding sourcing and varnishes.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

3. 4077571 Canada Inc. v Pine Trading Co., Ltd.:
   - Tony, by his conduct, led Nick to believe that he would accept performance in a different manner (using non-local wood and chemical-based varnishes).
   - The period of postponement or deviation was not specified in any waiver.
   - Nick is entitled, upon reasonable notice, to impose a new time-limit or require compliance with the original mode of performance.
   - Circumstances have not so changed as to render it impossible or inequitable for Nick to require compliance with the original terms.

### Conclusion:

Nick is entitled to terminate the contract and recover potential damages based on the breach of the implied terms regarding the sourcing of wood and the use of plant-based varnishes and paints. The conduct of Tony does not constitute a waiver or a new implied contract, and Nick can enforce the original terms of the contract.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (CHEUNG LI ON v. SUN LIFE HONG KONG LTD)

In the case of CHEUNG LI ON v. SUN LIFE HONG KONG LTD [2021] HKCFI 3784; HCA 2549/2016 (precedent p), Mr. Cheung, an insurance agent, claimed that there was an implied term that the power to terminate his contract should be exercised lawfully and rationally. He also claimed that there were oral agreements and arrangements that Sun Life breached. The court ruled that the oral agreements and implied terms were contradictory to the express terms of the written agreements, and since the written agreements were clear and unambiguous, they took precedence. The court found that Mr. Cheung had not provided sufficient evidence to support his claims and dismissed his case.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in CHEUNG LI ON v. SUN LIFE HONG KONG LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Written Agreements vs. Oral Agreements**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, there were written agreements that were clear and unambiguous. In CHEUNG LI ON, the written agreements governed the relationship between Mr. Cheung and Sun Life. In our current case, the written agreement specifies the contract duration, delivery dates, amounts, price, and wood type.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Implied Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In both cases, the plaintiffs claimed the existence of implied terms that were not explicitly stated in the written agreements. In CHEUNG LI ON, Mr. Cheung claimed an implied term that the termination should be lawful and rational. In our current case, Nick might argue that there was an implied term that all wood should be locally sourced and all finishes should be plant-based.
  
- **Legal Concept 3: Breach of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: Both cases involve allegations of breach of contract. In CHEUNG LI ON, Mr. Cheung alleged that Sun Life breached the oral agreements and implied terms. In our current case, Nick alleges that Tony breached the contract by supplying non-local wood and using chemical-based finishes.
  
- **Legal Concept 4: Evidence and Proof**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In both cases, the burden of proof lies with the plaintiff to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims. In CHEUNG LI ON, Mr. Cheung failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his claims. In our current case, Nick will need to provide evidence that the implied terms were part of the agreement and that Tony breached these terms.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (CHEUNG LI ON v. SUN LIFE HONG KONG LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern where written agreements are clear and unambiguous, and there are claims of implied terms or oral agreements that contradict the written agreements, the court should decide in favor of the written agreements. This rule was justified in CHEUNG LI ON v. SUN LIFE HONG KONG LTD because the positive effects (E+) of upholding the clarity and certainty of written agreements outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially disregarding oral agreements or implied terms that are not sufficiently evidenced.

In our current case, applying this rule would mean that the written agreement between Nick and Tony, which is silent on the sourcing and paint/varnish requirements, would take precedence. Nick would need to provide strong evidence to support the existence of any implied terms or oral agreements that contradict the written agreement. If he fails to do so, the court is likely to rule in favor of the written agreement, similar to the outcome in CHEUNG LI ON v. SUN LIFE HONG KONG LTD.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (CHEUNG LI ON v. SUN LIFE HONG KONG LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Written Agreements vs. Oral Agreements**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, there were written agreements that were clear and unambiguous. In CHEUNG LI ON, the written agreements governed the relationship between Mr. Cheung and Sun Life. In our current case, the written agreement specifies the contract duration, delivery dates, amounts, price, and wood type.

- **Legal Concept 2: Implied Terms**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In both cases, the plaintiffs claimed the existence of implied terms that were not explicitly stated in the written agreements. In CHEUNG LI ON, Mr. Cheung claimed an implied term that the termination should be lawful and rational. In our current case, Nick might argue that there was an implied term that all wood should be locally sourced and all finishes should be plant-based.

- **Legal Concept 3: Breach of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: Both cases involve allegations of breach of contract. In CHEUNG LI ON, Mr. Cheung alleged that Sun Life breached the oral agreements and implied terms. In our current case, Nick alleges that Tony breached the contract by supplying non-local wood and using chemical-based finishes.

- **Legal Concept 4: Evidence and Proof**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In both cases, the burden of proof lies with the plaintiff to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims. In CHEUNG LI ON, Mr. Cheung failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his claims. In our current case, Nick will need to provide evidence that the implied terms were part of the agreement and that Tony breached these terms.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in CHEUNG LI ON v. SUN LIFE HONG KONG LTD. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding the Certainty and Clarity of Written Agreements**: Enforcing the written agreement as the primary source of the contractual terms ensures that parties can rely on the clear and unambiguous terms they have agreed upon. This promotes legal certainty and predictability in commercial transactions.

2. **Discouraging Unsubstantiated Claims**: By requiring strong evidence to support any claims of implied terms or oral agreements that contradict the written agreement, the court discourages parties from making unsubstantiated claims. This helps to maintain the integrity of contractual relationships and reduces frivolous litigation.

3. **Encouraging Proper Documentation**: The decision reinforces the importance of properly documenting all essential terms of a contract. This encourages parties to ensure that all critical aspects of their agreement are explicitly stated in writing, reducing the likelihood of disputes arising from misunderstandings or unspoken expectations.

4. **Promoting Fairness and Good Faith**: While the court upholds the written agreement, it also implicitly encourages parties to act in good faith and to communicate clearly about their expectations and requirements. This fosters a more transparent and cooperative business environment.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in CHEUNG LI ON v. SUN LIFE HONG KONG LTD. This decision would be justified because it would uphold the principles of legal certainty, discourage unsubstantiated claims, encourage proper documentation, and promote fairness and good faith in contractual relationships.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case

In the precedent case **CHEUNG LI ON v. SUN LIFE HONG KONG LTD**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of **clear and unambiguous written agreements** that governed the relationship between the parties. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—upholding the certainty and clarity of written agreements—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it promoted legal certainty and predictability in commercial transactions. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of **clear and unambiguous written agreements** is notably absent as the written agreement between Nick and Tony is silent on the critical aspects of sourcing and paint/varnish requirements, which are central to Nick's business model and reputation.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case

Our current case involves an important factor **(Nick's explicit communication of his environmental requirements and Tony's verbal assurances)** that was not present in **CHEUNG LI ON v. SUN LIFE HONG KONG LTD**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because Nick explicitly communicated his environmental requirements to Tony, and Tony provided verbal assurances that he would comply with these requirements. Due to this factor, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as **undermining the importance of verbal assurances in business dealings and potentially harming Nick's business reputation** than positive ones, unlike in **CHEUNG LI ON v. SUN LIFE HONG KONG LTD**. This is because, in our case, the verbal assurances were a critical part of the agreement and were relied upon by Nick in entering into the contract. Ignoring these assurances would not only harm Nick's business but also set a precedent that verbal commitments, even when explicitly communicated and relied upon, can be disregarded, thereby undermining trust in business relationships.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from **CHEUNG LI ON v. SUN LIFE HONG KONG LTD** should be stated as: "When both [i*] (clear and unambiguous written agreements) and [m] (absence of explicit verbal assurances that contradict the written agreement) are present, the court should decide [o] (in favor of the written agreement)." Omitting [m] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q] (undermining the importance of verbal assurances in business dealings and potentially harming the plaintiff's business reputation). Indeed, the opinion in **CHEUNG LI ON v. SUN LIFE HONG KONG LTD** explicitly states that the written agreements were clear and unambiguous, which was crucial to their decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in **CHEUNG LI ON v. SUN LIFE HONG KONG LTD** was clearly designed to prevent [undesirable consequence u] (the undermining of the certainty and clarity of written agreements). However, in our current case, there's no risk of [u] occurring because the written agreement is silent on the critical aspects of sourcing and paint/varnish requirements, which are central to Nick's business model and reputation. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should consider the explicit verbal assurances provided by Tony, which were a critical part of the agreement and relied upon by Nick.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction

While it's true that our case lacks the clear and unambiguous written agreements specifying the sourcing and paint/varnish requirements, which was present in the precedent case **CHEUNG LI ON v. SUN LIFE HONG KONG LTD**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of written agreements versus oral agreements and implied terms would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would undermine the importance of verbal assurances in business dealings and potentially harm the plaintiff's business reputation. Conversely, not requiring the clear and unambiguous written agreements would allow for the enforcement of verbal assurances that were explicitly communicated and relied upon, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and good faith in contractual relationships. This approach ensures that parties cannot disregard critical verbal commitments that were integral to the formation of the contract, thereby promoting trust and integrity in business transactions.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution

Although our case lacks the clear and unambiguous written agreements specifying the sourcing and paint/varnish requirements, which was present in **CHEUNG LI ON v. SUN LIFE HONG KONG LTD**, we have the additional factor of explicit verbal assurances provided by Tony. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of written agreements versus oral agreements and implied terms, serves a similar function to the clear and unambiguous written agreements in the precedent case. Given the presence of these explicit verbal assurances, we submit that the reasoning in **CHEUNG LI ON v. SUN LIFE HONG KONG LTD** still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as fairness, good faith, and the integrity of business relationships would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. This ensures that verbal commitments, especially those that are explicitly communicated and relied upon, are given due consideration in the enforcement of contracts.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **CHEUNG LI ON v. SUN LIFE HONG KONG LTD**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of written agreements and claims of implied terms or oral agreements that contradict the written agreements. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the explicit verbal assurances provided by Tony to Nick, which were critical to Nick's decision to enter into the contract.

The proposed legal rule from **CHEUNG LI ON v. SUN LIFE HONG KONG LTD**—that clear and unambiguous written agreements should take precedence over implied terms or oral agreements—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the explicit verbal assurances in our current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of upholding the certainty and clarity of written agreements (a strong point from the precedent) and the need to consider explicit verbal assurances that were relied upon (a strong point from the current case).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, good faith, and the integrity of business relationships, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that the court should give due consideration to the explicit verbal assurances provided by Tony. Ignoring these assurances would undermine trust in business relationships and potentially harm Nick's business reputation, which is built on strict environmental standards.

Therefore, we decide that Nick should be allowed to terminate the contract and seek damages, as the verbal assurances provided by Tony were a critical part of the agreement and were explicitly relied upon by Nick. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by ensuring that verbal commitments, especially those that are explicitly communicated and relied upon, are given due consideration in the enforcement of contracts.

### Major Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - A contract governed by law applicable to the Colony has become impossible of performance or been otherwise frustrated.
   - The parties thereto have for that reason been discharged from the further performance of the contract.

   Consequences:
   - All sums paid or payable to any party in pursuance of the contract before the time of discharge shall, in the case of sums so paid, be recoverable from him as money received by him for the use of the party by whom the sums were paid.
   - In the case of sums so payable, cease to be so payable.

   Exceptions:
   - If the party to whom the sums were so paid or payable incurred expenses before the time of discharge in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, the court may, if it considers it just to do so having regard to all the circumstances of the case, allow him to retain or, as the case may be, recover the whole or any part of the sums so paid or payable, not being an amount in excess of the expenses so incurred.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3

   Conditions:
   - Any party to the contract has, by reason of anything done by any other party thereto in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, obtained a valuable benefit (other than a payment of money to which subsection (2) applies) before the time of discharge.

   Consequences:
   - There shall be recoverable from him by the said other party such sum (if any), not exceeding the value of the said benefit to the party obtaining it, as the court considers just, having regard to all the circumstances of the case.

   Exceptions:

   Exceptions:
   - None.

### Minor Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2:
   - Nick and Tony entered into a contract governed by Hong Kong law.
   - The contract has not become impossible of performance or been otherwise frustrated; rather, Tony has breached the contract by supplying non-compliant materials.
   - Therefore, this section does not apply.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3:
   - Tony has obtained a valuable benefit by supplying non-compliant materials to Nick.
   - This benefit is not a payment of money to which subsection (2) applies.
   - Therefore, this section applies, and Nick may recover a sum not exceeding the value of the benefit obtained by Tony, as the court considers just.

3. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 4:
   - The court may estimate the amount of any expenses incurred by Tony for the purposes of subsections (1), (2), and (3).
   - The court may include reasonable overhead expenses and any work or services performed personally by Tony.
   - Therefore, this section applies if the court needs to estimate expenses.

4. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 5:
   - The court is considering whether any sum ought to be recovered or retained under subsections (1), (2), (3), and (4) by Tony.
   - The court shall not take into account any sums payable to Tony under any contract of insurance unless there was an obligation to insure imposed by an express term of the frustrated contract or by or under any enactment.
   - Therefore, this section applies if insurance sums are relevant.

### Conclusion:

The breach of contract by Tony does not constitute frustration of the contract under the Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16. However, Nick may recover a sum not exceeding the value of the benefit obtained by Tony due to the breach, as the court considers just, under Section 16 Subsection 3. The court may also consider any reasonable expenses incurred by Tony under Section 16 Subsection 4.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD)

In the case of CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD [2023] HKCFI 311; HCA 1641/2020 (precedent p), the Plaintiffs engaged the Defendant to carry out various construction and renovation works at their premises. The Defendant failed to complete the works as agreed, leading to the Plaintiffs terminating the contracts and engaging another contractor to complete the unfinished works and rectify defects. The court ruled that the Plaintiffs were entitled to damages for the diminished value of the works, costs of rectification by another contractor, and other related expenses due to the Defendant's breach of contract.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Breach of Contract**: In both cases, the Defendants failed to adhere to the terms agreed upon in the contracts. In CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL, the Defendant did not complete the renovation works as agreed. In our current case, Tony supplied wood and finishes that did not meet the specified environmental standards.
  
- **Implied Terms**: Both cases involve breaches of implied terms. In CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL, the Defendant breached an implied term to carry out the works with reasonable care and skill. In our current case, Tony breached the implied term to supply materials that meet the specific environmental standards crucial to Nick's business.
  
- **Termination of Contract**: In both cases, the Plaintiffs terminated the contracts due to the Defendants' breaches. In CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL, the Plaintiffs terminated the contracts and engaged another contractor. In our current case, Nick wishes to terminate the contract with Tony.
  
- **Damages**: Both cases involve claims for damages resulting from the Defendants' breaches. In CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL, the Plaintiffs claimed damages for the diminished value of the works, costs of rectification, and other related expenses. In our current case, Nick seeks to recover potential damages for the breach of contract by Tony.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see a breach of contract involving failure to adhere to specific terms crucial to the contract's purpose, the court should decide in favor of the non-breaching party's right to terminate the contract and claim damages. This rule was justified in CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD because the positive effects (E+) of allowing the Plaintiffs to recover damages and terminate the contract upheld the underlying values of contract law, such as ensuring parties adhere to agreed terms and providing remedies for breaches, outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially encouraging litigation.

In our current case, applying this rule would mean that Nick is justified in terminating the contract with Tony and seeking damages for the breach, as Tony's failure to supply locally sourced wood and plant-based finishes directly undermines the core purpose of Nick's eco-friendly business, similar to how the Defendant's failure in CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL undermined the Plaintiffs' renovation project.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD) are present:

- **Breach of Contract**: In both cases, the Defendants failed to adhere to the terms agreed upon in the contracts. In CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL, the Defendant did not complete the renovation works as agreed. In our current case, Tony supplied wood and finishes that did not meet the specified environmental standards.
  
- **Implied Terms**: Both cases involve breaches of implied terms. In CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL, the Defendant breached an implied term to carry out the works with reasonable care and skill. In our current case, Tony breached the implied term to supply materials that meet the specific environmental standards crucial to Nick's business.
  
- **Termination of Contract**: In both cases, the Plaintiffs terminated the contracts due to the Defendants' breaches. In CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL, the Plaintiffs terminated the contracts and engaged another contractor. In our current case, Nick wishes to terminate the contract with Tony.
  
- **Damages**: Both cases involve claims for damages resulting from the Defendants' breaches. In CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL, the Plaintiffs claimed damages for the diminished value of the works, costs of rectification, and other related expenses. In our current case, Nick seeks to recover potential damages for the breach of contract by Tony.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Contractual Integrity**: Enforcing the right to terminate the contract and claim damages would reinforce the importance of adhering to agreed terms, especially those that are fundamental to the contract's purpose. In Nick's case, the environmental standards are crucial to his business model and reputation.

2. **Providing Remedies for Breach**: Allowing Nick to recover damages would ensure that he is compensated for the losses incurred due to Tony's breach. This aligns with the principle that the non-breaching party should be placed in the same position as if the contract had been performed.

3. **Encouraging Compliance**: Such a ruling would deter parties from breaching contracts, knowing that they would be held accountable for any deviations from the agreed terms, especially when those terms are explicitly communicated as critical to the contract's purpose.

4. **Promoting Fairness**: The decision would promote fairness by ensuring that Nick is not left to bear the consequences of Tony's failure to meet the agreed environmental standards, which are integral to Nick's business operations.

Therefore, given the shared fact patterns and the positive effects on the underlying values and principles of contract law, the court should allow Nick to terminate the contract and recover potential damages, just as it did in CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, namely the explicit communication and understanding between Nick and Tony regarding the environmental standards crucial to Nick's business, which was not present in CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the explicit communication and understanding about the environmental standards were fundamental to the contract's purpose and Nick's business model.

Due to this explicit understanding, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the importance of specific and critical terms that are communicated and agreed upon, even if not explicitly written in the contract. This would lead to a lack of trust in business agreements where verbal assurances are given significant weight, unlike in CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD, where the breach was more about the failure to complete the works as agreed without such a specific and critical understanding. Therefore, the presence of this explicit understanding in our current case justifies a different approach, emphasizing the importance of adhering to all agreed terms, whether written or verbally assured, especially when they are crucial to the contract's purpose.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD should be stated as: "When both a breach of contract involving failure to adhere to specific terms crucial to the contract's purpose (i*) and an explicit communication and understanding about these crucial terms (m) are present, the court should decide in favor of the non-breaching party's right to terminate the contract and claim damages (o)." Omitting the explicit communication and understanding (m) from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence (q) of undermining the importance of specific and critical terms that are communicated and agreed upon, even if not explicitly written in the contract. This would lead to a lack of trust in business agreements where verbal assurances are given significant weight.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence (u) of parties being left uncompensated for breaches of contract that undermine the core purpose of the agreement. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence (u) occurring because the explicit communication and understanding about the environmental standards were fundamental to the contract's purpose and Nick's business model. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule without considering the explicit understanding would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The explicit understanding about the environmental standards should be given significant weight, justifying Nick's right to terminate the contract and claim damages.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the explicit written terms regarding the sourcing and paint/varnish requirements, which was present in the precedent case CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD, requiring this factor for all similar cases of breach of contract involving failure to adhere to specific terms crucial to the contract's purpose would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would undermine the importance of verbal assurances and explicit understandings that are fundamental to the contract's purpose, even if not explicitly written. Conversely, not requiring the explicit written terms would allow for a more holistic consideration of the parties' intentions and the critical nature of the terms to the contract's purpose, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, such as ensuring parties adhere to agreed terms and providing remedies for breaches.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the explicit written terms regarding the sourcing and paint/varnish requirements, which was present in CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD, we have the additional factor of explicit verbal assurances and understandings about these crucial terms. This explicit understanding, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of breach of contract involving failure to adhere to specific terms crucial to the contract's purpose, serves a similar function to the written terms in the precedent case. Given the presence of this explicit understanding, we submit that the reasoning in CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD still applies, as the positive effects on upholding contractual integrity, providing remedies for breach, encouraging compliance, and promoting fairness would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the breach of contract involving failure to adhere to specific terms crucial to the contract's purpose, the implied terms, the termination of the contract due to the breach, and the claim for damages resulting from the breach. However, it also differs in a significant way: the explicit verbal assurances and understandings about the environmental standards, which were fundamental to Nick's business model, were not present in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule of allowing the non-breaching party to terminate the contract and claim damages when there is a breach of specific terms crucial to the contract's purpose finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the explicit verbal assurances in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of upholding contractual integrity and providing remedies for breaches (as argued in favor of Nick) and the need to consider explicit verbal assurances and understandings even if not written (as argued in the rebuttal).

Considering the underlying legal principles of ensuring parties adhere to agreed terms, providing remedies for breaches, and promoting fairness, we conclude that Nick is justified in terminating the contract and seeking damages. The explicit verbal assurances and understandings about the environmental standards are crucial to the contract's purpose and Nick's business model, and should be given significant weight.

Therefore, the decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency. Nick should be allowed to terminate the contract with Tony and recover potential damages for the breach, as this upholds the integrity of the contractual agreement and compensates Nick for the losses incurred due to Tony's failure to meet the agreed environmental standards.

   Consequences:
   - The liability can be excluded or restricted by reference to a contract term, but only in so far as the term satisfies the requirement of reasonableness.

   Exceptions:
   - None.

### Minor Premise:

1. Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457 Section 8 Subsections 1-3:
   - Nick and Tony have a contract for the supply of wood and finishes.
   - The contract is silent on the sourcing and type of varnishes/paints, which could imply a term under the Ordinance.
   - The implied term can be negatived or varied by express agreement, but there is no express agreement on these points.
   - Nick is not dealing as a consumer, so the exception does not apply.

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 57 Subsections 1-2:
   - The contract involves the sale of goods (wood and finishes).
   - The implied terms regarding the quality and sourcing of goods can be negatived or varied by express agreement, but the contract is silent on these points.
   - The Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 applies, as Nick is not a consumer.

3. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 11 Subsection 2:
   - Nick is not dealing as a consumer, so this section does not apply.

4. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 11 Subsection 3:
   - Nick is dealing otherwise than as a consumer.
   - There is a liability for breach of the obligations arising from sections 15, 16 or 17 of the Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26.
   - The liability can be excluded or restricted by reference to a contract term, but only if the term satisfies the requirement of reasonableness.
   - The contract is silent on these points, so no exclusion or restriction applies.

### Conclusion:

Nick can seek to terminate the contract and recover potential damages based on the breach of implied terms under the Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 and the Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance Cap. 457. The implied terms regarding the sourcing of wood and the type of varnishes/paints have been breached, and there is no express agreement or reasonable exclusion clause to negate these implied terms. Therefore, Nick has a strong case for termination and damages.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD)

In the case of FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD [2019] HKCFI 2373; HCA 1759/2018 (precedent p), the plaintiff and the defendant entered into a contract for the sale of goods. The plaintiff paid the full purchase price, but the goods delivered by the defendant were used and/or defective and not of merchantable quality. The plaintiff rejected the goods, accepted the defendant’s repudiation of the contract, and demanded repayment. The court ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the purchase price as damages for wasted expenditure and additional costs incurred due to the defendant's failure to take back the goods.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Breach of Contract**: In both cases, the defendant failed to comply with the specific terms of the contract. In the precedent case, the goods were defective and not of merchantable quality. In the current case, Tony supplied wood that was not locally sourced and used chemical-based varnishes and paints, contrary to the specific requirements communicated by Nick.
  
- **Repudiatory Breach**: In both cases, the breach was significant enough to be considered repudiatory. In the precedent case, the delivery of defective goods constituted a repudiatory breach. In the current case, the deviation from the agreed sourcing and finishing requirements undermines the fundamental purpose of Nick's business, which can be argued as a repudiatory breach.
  
- **Rejection of Goods**: In both cases, the plaintiff rejected the goods due to the breach. In the precedent case, the plaintiff rejected the defective goods. In the current case, Nick wishes to reject the non-compliant wood and finishes.
  
- **Damages for Wasted Expenditure**: In both cases, the plaintiff seeks to recover the costs incurred due to the breach. In the precedent case, the plaintiff recovered the purchase price and additional storage costs. In the current case, Nick seeks to terminate the contract and recover potential damages for the non-compliant supplies.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern where the defendant's breach of contract is significant enough to be considered repudiatory, and the plaintiff rejects the goods due to this breach, the court should decide that the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages for wasted expenditure and any additional costs incurred.

This rule was justified in FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD because the positive effects (E+) of allowing the plaintiff to recover the purchase price and additional costs supported the underlying values and principles of contract law, such as ensuring that parties adhere to their contractual obligations and providing remedies for breaches that undermine the fundamental purpose of the contract. The negative effects (E-) of not allowing such recovery would have left the plaintiff uncompensated for the breach, thereby undermining the integrity of contractual agreements.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD) are present:

- **Breach of Contract**: In both cases, the defendant failed to comply with the specific terms of the contract. In the precedent case, the goods were defective and not of merchantable quality. In the current case, Tony supplied wood that was not locally sourced and used chemical-based varnishes and paints, contrary to the specific requirements communicated by Nick.
  
- **Repudiatory Breach**: In both cases, the breach was significant enough to be considered repudiatory. In the precedent case, the delivery of defective goods constituted a repudiatory breach. In the current case, the deviation from the agreed sourcing and finishing requirements undermines the fundamental purpose of Nick's business, which can be argued as a repudiatory breach.
  
- **Rejection of Goods**: In both cases, the plaintiff rejected the goods due to the breach. In the precedent case, the plaintiff rejected the defective goods. In the current case, Nick wishes to reject the non-compliant wood and finishes.
  
- **Damages for Wasted Expenditure**: In both cases, the plaintiff seeks to recover the costs incurred due to the breach. In the precedent case, the plaintiff recovered the purchase price and additional storage costs. In the current case, Nick seeks to terminate the contract and recover potential damages for the non-compliant supplies.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Contractual Obligations**: Enforcing the contract terms and allowing Nick to recover damages would reinforce the importance of adhering to specific contractual obligations, especially those that are fundamental to the nature of the business, such as ethical sourcing in this case.

2. **Providing Remedies for Breach**: Allowing Nick to recover damages for wasted expenditure ensures that he is compensated for the breach, thereby maintaining the integrity of contractual agreements and providing a remedy that aligns with the expectations set by the contract.

3. **Deterrence**: This outcome would serve as a deterrent to other suppliers who might consider breaching similar contracts, knowing that they would be held accountable for any deviations from agreed terms.

4. **Fairness and Justice**: It ensures fairness and justice by holding Tony accountable for not meeting the specific requirements that were crucial to Nick's business, even if those requirements were not explicitly stated in the written contract but were clearly communicated and understood by both parties.

Therefore, given the shared fact patterns and the positive effects on the underlying values and principles of contract law, the court should reach the same outcome as in the precedent case, allowing Nick to terminate the contract and recover potential damages.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the goods delivered were not of merchantable quality, which was a clear and objective standard under the Sale of Goods Ordinance (Cap 26) ("SOGO"). This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as upholding contractual obligations and providing remedies for breach, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided a clear legal basis for the plaintiff's rejection of the goods and claim for damages.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of an objective standard of merchantable quality under SOGO is notably absent. The contract between Nick and Tony is silent on the specific requirements for locally sourced wood and plant-based varnishes and paints. While Nick communicated these requirements verbally, they were not explicitly included in the written contract. This absence of a clear, objective standard like merchantable quality makes it more challenging to argue that Tony's breach is as clear-cut as in the precedent case.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the specific verbal agreement and understanding between Nick and Tony regarding the sourcing and finishing requirements, that was not present in **FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the breach in our current case hinges on the verbal assurances and the ethical considerations that are fundamental to Nick's business, rather than an objective standard like merchantable quality.

Due to this verbal agreement and the ethical considerations, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as undermining the importance of verbal agreements and ethical business practices, than positive ones, unlike in **FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD**. The precedent case dealt with a clear statutory breach, whereas our current case involves nuanced ethical and verbal commitments that are not explicitly covered by the written contract, making it less straightforward to apply the same legal principles and outcomes.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD** should be stated as: "When both a breach of contract that undermines the fundamental purpose of the agreement and an objective standard of non-compliance (such as merchantable quality) are present, the court should decide that the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages for wasted expenditure and any additional costs incurred." Omitting the objective standard of non-compliance from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of undermining the enforceability of verbal agreements and ethical business practices, which are crucial in certain industries. Indeed, the opinion in **FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD** explicitly states that the goods were not of merchantable quality, which was a clear and objective standard under the Sale of Goods Ordinance (Cap 26) ("SOGO"), and this was crucial to their decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD** was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of leaving a plaintiff uncompensated for a breach of contract where the goods delivered were not of merchantable quality, thereby undermining the integrity of contractual agreements. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence occurring because the breach involves nuanced ethical and verbal commitments that are not explicitly covered by the written contract. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—ensuring compensation for breaches involving clear, objective standards—is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the focus should be on the enforceability of verbal agreements and ethical business practices, which are fundamental to Nick's business.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the objective standard of non-compliance (merchantable quality) present in the precedent case **FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of breach of contract would lead to the undesirable consequence of undermining the enforceability of verbal agreements and ethical business practices. Conversely, not requiring the objective standard of non-compliance would allow for the desirable outcome of upholding the integrity of verbal agreements and ethical commitments, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, such as ensuring that parties adhere to their communicated and understood obligations, even if not explicitly stated in the written contract.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the objective standard of non-compliance (merchantable quality), which was present in **FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD**, we have the additional factor of a specific verbal agreement and ethical considerations. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of a significant breach of contract and the rejection of goods, serves a similar function to the objective standard in the precedent case. Given the presence of the specific verbal agreement and ethical considerations, we submit that the reasoning in **FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD** still applies, as the positive effects on upholding contractual obligations and providing remedies for breach would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations.

**Key Similarities:**
1. **Breach of Contract:** Both cases involve a breach of contract where the defendant failed to comply with specific terms. In the precedent case, the goods were defective and not of merchantable quality. In the current case, Tony supplied wood that was not locally sourced and used chemical-based varnishes and paints, contrary to the specific requirements communicated by Nick.
2. **Repudiatory Breach:** In both cases, the breach was significant enough to be considered repudiatory, undermining the fundamental purpose of the contract.
3. **Rejection of Goods:** Both plaintiffs rejected the goods due to the breach.
4. **Damages for Wasted Expenditure:** Both plaintiffs seek to recover the costs incurred due to the breach.

**Key Differences:**
1. **Objective Standard of Non-Compliance:** The precedent case involved an objective standard of non-compliance (merchantable quality) under the Sale of Goods Ordinance (Cap 26) ("SOGO"), which provided a clear legal basis for the plaintiff's rejection of the goods and claim for damages. This objective standard is absent in the current case.
2. **Verbal Agreement and Ethical Considerations:** The current case involves a specific verbal agreement and ethical considerations that were not explicitly included in the written contract but were fundamental to Nick's business.

**Proposed Legal Rule:**
The rule from **FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD** suggests that when both a breach of contract that undermines the fundamental purpose of the agreement and an objective standard of non-compliance are present, the court should decide that the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages for wasted expenditure and any additional costs incurred.

**Assessment:**
- **Merits of the Initial Analogy:** The initial analogy correctly identifies the shared legal concepts and fact patterns, suggesting that the court should reach a similar outcome in the current case.
- **Flaws in the Initial Analogy:** The absence of an objective standard of non-compliance in the current case makes it less straightforward to apply the same legal principles and outcomes as in the precedent case.
- **Merits of the Rebuttal Arguments:** The rebuttal arguments correctly highlight the importance of the objective standard of non-compliance in the precedent case and the nuanced ethical and verbal commitments in the current case.
- **Flaws in the Rebuttal Arguments:** The rebuttal arguments may overemphasize the absence of the objective standard, potentially undermining the enforceability of verbal agreements and ethical business practices.
- **Merits of the Surrebuttal Arguments:** The surrebuttal arguments effectively argue that the specific verbal agreement and ethical considerations in the current case serve a similar function to the objective standard in the precedent case, supporting the application of the same legal principles and outcomes.

**Final Decision:**
Considering the underlying legal principles of upholding contractual obligations, providing remedies for breach, and ensuring fairness and justice, we conclude that Nick should be entitled to terminate the contract and recover potential damages. The specific verbal agreement and ethical considerations, although not explicitly included in the written contract, were fundamental to Nick's business and were clearly communicated and understood by both parties. This aligns with the principles of contract law and serves justice by holding Tony accountable for not meeting the specific requirements that were crucial to Nick's business.

Therefore, the court should decide that Nick is entitled to terminate the contract and recover damages for wasted expenditure and any additional costs incurred, similar to the outcome in **FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD**. This decision reinforces the importance of adhering to communicated and understood contractual obligations, even if not explicitly stated in the written contract, and upholds the integrity of verbal agreements and ethical business practices.

   Exceptions:
   - Unless there is a term of the contract, express or implied, to that effect

### Minor Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 55 Subsection 1:
   - Nick has entered into a contract with Tony for the supply of wood.
   - Tony has breached the warranty by supplying non-locally sourced wood and using chemical-based varnishes and paints.
   - Nick is not entitled to reject the goods solely based on this breach of warranty.
   - Nick may set up against Tony the breach of warranty in diminution or extinction of the price or maintain an action for damages.

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 55 Subsections 2 and 3:
   - There is a breach of warranty of quality as the wood and finishes do not meet the specified environmental standards.
   - The measure of damages is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting from the breach, which is the difference between the value of the goods as delivered and the value they would have had if they had met the warranty.

3. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 13 Subsection 1:
   - The contract term regarding the sourcing and finishes must satisfy the requirement of reasonableness.
   - The contract has been terminated by Nick due to Tony's breach.

4. Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 13 Subsection 2:
   - The requirement of reasonableness in relation to any contract term is not excluded even if Nick affirms the contract.

5. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 13 Subsection 3:
   - The contract of sale is subject to the condition that the wood and finishes meet specific environmental standards.
   - Nick has accepted part of the goods.
   - The breach of this condition can only be treated as a breach of warranty unless there is an express or implied term to the contrary.

### Conclusion:

Nick is not entitled to reject the goods solely based on the breach of warranty but may set up the breach of warranty in diminution or extinction of the price or maintain an action for damages. The measure of damages will be the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting from the breach, which is the difference between the value of the goods as delivered and the value they would have had if they had met the warranty. The requirement of reasonableness for any contract term is not excluded, and the breach of condition can only be treated as a breach of warranty unless there is an express or implied term to the contrary.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA012158/1997)
In the case of HCA012158/1997 BETWEEN MAN KEUNG COMPANY LIMITED Plaintiff AND PROSPERITY MACHINERY MANUFACTURERS LIMITED Defendant (precedent p), the Plaintiff claimed for the price of goods sold and delivered, while the Defendant argued that the goods did not meet the British Standard and that the Plaintiff failed to provide the necessary certificates. The court ruled that the Defendant was liable to pay for the goods as the purchase orders did not specify the requirement for British Standard compliance or the provision of certificates, and the goods were accepted by the Defendant (outcome o).

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA012158/1997 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Contractual Terms and Conditions**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA012158/1997, the purchase orders did not specify the requirement for British Standard compliance or the provision of certificates. In our current case, the written agreement is silent on the sourcing and paint/varnish requirements.
- **Legal Concept 2: Oral Representations and Reliance**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA012158/1997, there were oral discussions about the British Standard, but they were not included in the written contract. In our current case, Nick had oral discussions with Tony about the sourcing and paint/varnish requirements, but these were not included in the written contract.
- **Legal Concept 3: Breach of Contract**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA012158/1997, the Defendant claimed a breach due to non-compliance with British Standards and lack of certificates. In our current case, Nick claims a breach due to the use of non-locally sourced wood and chemical-based varnishes and paints.
- **Legal Concept 4: Acceptance of Goods**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCA012158/1997, the Defendant accepted the goods despite the alleged non-compliance. In our current case, Nick has been using the supplied wood for three months before discovering the non-compliance.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA012158/1997)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern where the written contract is silent on specific requirements discussed orally, and the goods are accepted and used, the court should decide that the party claiming breach is liable to fulfill the contract terms as written (outcome o). This rule was justified in HCA012158/1997 because the positive effects (E+) of upholding the written contract terms and ensuring certainty in commercial transactions outweigh the negative effects (E-) of disregarding oral representations not included in the contract. This promotes the underlying values of contract law, such as the importance of written agreements and the need for clear and enforceable terms.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA012158/1997) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Contractual Terms and Conditions**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA012158/1997, the purchase orders did not specify the requirement for British Standard compliance or the provision of certificates. In our current case, the written agreement is silent on the sourcing and paint/varnish requirements.

- **Legal Concept 2: Oral Representations and Reliance**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA012158/1997, there were oral discussions about the British Standard, but they were not included in the written contract. In our current case, Nick had oral discussions with Tony about the sourcing and paint/varnish requirements, but these were not included in the written contract.

- **Legal Concept 3: Breach of Contract**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA012158/1997, the Defendant claimed a breach due to non-compliance with British Standards and lack of certificates. In our current case, Nick claims a breach due to the use of non-locally sourced wood and chemical-based varnishes and paints.

- **Legal Concept 4: Acceptance of Goods**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCA012158/1997, the Defendant accepted the goods despite the alleged non-compliance. In our current case, Nick has been using the supplied wood for three months before discovering the non-compliance.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCA012158/1997. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA012158/1997, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Written Contract Terms**: Enforcing the written terms of the contract promotes certainty and predictability in commercial transactions. Parties are encouraged to clearly document all essential terms and conditions in their written agreements, reducing the risk of disputes arising from oral representations.

2. **Encouraging Diligence in Contract Formation**: By holding parties to the terms of their written agreements, the court incentivizes thoroughness and diligence during contract formation. This ensures that all critical terms are explicitly stated, minimizing ambiguities and misunderstandings.

3. **Promoting Fairness and Reliance on Written Agreements**: Enforcing the written contract terms ensures that parties can rely on the documented agreement, fostering trust and fairness in business dealings. It prevents one party from unilaterally altering the terms based on oral discussions that were not included in the final written contract.

4. **Reducing Litigation and Disputes**: Clear and enforceable written contracts reduce the likelihood of litigation and disputes, as parties have a definitive reference for their obligations and rights. This promotes efficient resolution of commercial matters and reduces the burden on the judicial system.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCA012158/1997. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would uphold the importance of written agreements, encourage diligence in contract formation, promote fairness, and reduce litigation.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA012158/1997, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the purchase orders did not specify the requirement for British Standard compliance or the provision of certificates. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—upholding the written contract terms and ensuring certainty in commercial transactions—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it promoted the importance of clear and enforceable written agreements. However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as the oral discussions between Nick and Tony explicitly emphasized the importance of locally sourced wood and plant-based varnishes and paints, which were central to Nick's business model and reputation. The absence of these specific requirements in the written contract does not negate their importance, as they were clearly communicated and relied upon by Nick.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—Nick's explicit reliance on Tony's oral assurances regarding the sourcing and paint/varnish requirements—that was not present in HCA012158/1997. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because Nick's business model and reputation as an ethical builder are directly tied to these specific requirements. Due to this reliance, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as undermining the trust in business relationships and potentially causing significant harm to Nick's business reputation, than positive ones. Unlike in HCA012158/1997, where the written contract's silence on specific requirements was deemed sufficient, the explicit oral assurances in our current case create a reasonable expectation that these terms would be honored, thereby justifying a different outcome.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA012158/1997 should be stated as 'When both the written contract is silent on specific requirements discussed orally and the goods are accepted and used, the court should decide that the party claiming breach is liable to fulfill the contract terms as written, unless there is explicit reliance on oral assurances that are central to the business model and reputation of the party.' Omitting the explicit reliance on oral assurances from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of undermining trust in business relationships and causing significant harm to businesses that rely on specific assurances for their operations. Indeed, the opinion in HCA012158/1997 implicitly acknowledges the importance of clear and enforceable written agreements, but it does not address situations where oral assurances are central to the business model and reputation of a party.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA012158/1997 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of uncertainty and unpredictability in commercial transactions by upholding the written terms of the contract. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because Nick's explicit reliance on Tony's oral assurances regarding the sourcing and paint/varnish requirements was central to his business model and reputation. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—promoting certainty and predictability in commercial transactions—is not relevant to our situation where the oral assurances were explicitly relied upon and are central to the business's operations.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the explicit written requirement for locally sourced wood and plant-based varnishes and paints, which was present in the precedent case HCA012158/1997, requiring this factor for all similar cases of oral assurances and reliance would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would undermine the trust and reliability in business relationships where one party explicitly relies on the oral assurances of another, especially when these assurances are central to the business model and reputation. Conversely, not requiring the explicit written requirement would allow for the protection of businesses that rely on specific assurances for their operations, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, such as fairness, reliance, and the protection of legitimate business expectations.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the explicit written requirement for locally sourced wood and plant-based varnishes and paints, which was present in HCA012158/1997, we have the additional factor of explicit reliance on oral assurances. This explicit reliance, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of oral discussions and the importance of the specific requirements to the business model, serves a similar function to the written requirement in the precedent case. Given the presence of explicit reliance, we submit that the reasoning in HCA012158/1997 still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as fairness, reliance, and the protection of legitimate business expectations would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA012158/1997, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the silence of the written contract on specific requirements discussed orally and the acceptance and use of the goods. However, it also differs significantly in that Nick's business model and reputation explicitly rely on the oral assurances provided by Tony regarding the sourcing and paint/varnish requirements.

The proposed legal rule from HCA012158/1997, which suggests that when the written contract is silent on specific requirements discussed orally and the goods are accepted and used, the party claiming breach is liable to fulfill the contract terms as written, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in situations where explicit reliance on oral assurances is central to the business model and reputation of a party.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of upholding written contract terms to ensure certainty and predictability in commercial transactions (a strong point from the initial analogy) and the need to protect businesses that rely on specific oral assurances for their operations (a strong point from the rebuttal).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, reliance, and the protection of legitimate business expectations, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Nick should be allowed to terminate the contract and seek damages. This decision is justified because the explicit reliance on oral assurances regarding the sourcing and paint/varnish requirements was central to Nick's business model and reputation, and failing to honor these assurances would cause significant harm to his business.

Therefore, the court should recognize the importance of these oral assurances and allow Nick to terminate the contract and recover potential damages, ensuring that justice and legal consistency are served.
