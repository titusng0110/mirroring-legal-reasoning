### Legal Analysis of the Scenario

#### 1. Identification of Legal Issues

The scenario presents several legal issues:
1. **Breach of Contract**: Whether Knock-Out and Copy Dog have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations.
2. **Doctrine of Frustration**: Whether the contracts have been frustrated due to the sudden collapse in demand for crocodile skin.
3. **Remedies for Breach**: If Knock-Out and Copy Dog do not have valid excuses, what remedies are available to Real Plastic.

#### 2. Applicable Laws and Principles

1. **Breach of Contract**:
   - **Time is of the Essence**: Both contracts stipulated that time was of the essence.
   - **Repudiation**: Real Plastic’s inability to deliver on time and the subsequent renegotiation of delivery dates.

2. **Doctrine of Frustration**:
   - **Frustration of Contract**: Whether the contracts have been frustrated due to the collapse in demand for crocodile skin.
   - **Relevant Case Law**: Davis Contractors Ltd v Fareham UDC [1956] AC 696, National Carriers Ltd v Panalpina (Northern) Ltd [1981] AC 675.

3. **Remedies for Breach**:
   - **Damages**: Measure of damages for non-delivery.
   - **Specific Performance**: Whether specific performance is a viable remedy.
   - **Relevant Legislation**: Sale of Goods Ordinance (Cap. 26), Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance (Cap. 23).

#### 3. Application of Law to Facts

**Breach of Contract**

- **Time is of the Essence**: Both contracts explicitly stated that time was of the essence. This means that timely delivery was a fundamental term of the contract. Real Plastic’s failure to deliver on 12 April constitutes a breach of contract.
  - **Case Law**: In Union Eagle Ltd v Golden Achievement Ltd [1997] AC 514, the Privy Council held that where time is of the essence, any delay constitutes a breach.

- **Repudiation and Renegotiation**: Real Plastic’s offer to delay delivery and Knock-Out’s acceptance of a new delivery date (19 April) with a 10% discount constitutes a variation of the original contract. The clerical error recording the new date as 9 April does not affect the agreed variation.
  - **Case Law**: In Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd [1962] 2 QB 26, the court held that parties can vary the terms of a contract by mutual agreement.

**Doctrine of Frustration**

- **Frustration of Contract**: The collapse in demand for crocodile skin does not constitute frustration. The doctrine of frustration applies when an unforeseen event renders contractual obligations impossible or radically different from what was agreed.
  - **Case Law**: In Davis Contractors Ltd v Fareham UDC, the House of Lords held that increased difficulty or expense does not constitute frustration. Similarly, in National Carriers Ltd v Panalpina (Northern) Ltd, the House of Lords held that frustration occurs only when performance becomes impossible or fundamentally different.

- **Application to Facts**: The collapse in demand for crocodile skin does not make performance impossible or fundamentally different. Knock-Out and Copy Dog’s obligations to pay for the synthetic leather remain unchanged.

**Remedies for Breach**

- **Damages for Non-Delivery**: Real Plastic can claim damages for non-delivery. The measure of damages is the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of delivery.
  - **Legislation**: Section 53 of the Sale of Goods Ordinance (Cap. 26) provides that the measure of damages is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting from the seller’s breach.
  - **Case Law**: In Zhaoqing Kidstar Foods Ltd v Utility Industrial Ltd [2018] HKCFI 2668, the court held that the buyer is entitled to damages based on the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of delivery.

- **Specific Performance**: Real Plastic may seek specific performance, compelling Knock-Out and Copy Dog to perform their contractual obligations.
  - **Legislation**: Section 54 of the Sale of Goods Ordinance (Cap. 26) allows the court to order specific performance for the delivery of specific or ascertained goods.
  - **Case Law**: In Beswick v Beswick [1968] AC 58, the House of Lords held that specific performance is an equitable remedy available at the court’s discretion.

- **Expenses Incurred**: Real Plastic can also claim for the $5 million spent preparing to perform the contracts.
  - **Case Law**: In Anglia Television Ltd v Reed [1972] 1 QB 60, the court held that a party can recover expenses incurred in preparation for performance if the contract is breached.

#### Conclusion

**Knock-Out and Copy Dog’s Excuses**:
- Knock-Out and Copy Dog do not have valid excuses for refusing to perform their contractual obligations. The collapse in demand for crocodile skin does not constitute frustration of the contracts.

**Remedies for Real Plastic**:
- Real Plastic can claim damages for non-delivery based on the difference between the contract price ($20 per meter) and the market price at the time of delivery ($12 per meter).
- Real Plastic may also seek specific performance to compel Knock-Out and Copy Dog to perform their contractual obligations.
- Additionally, Real Plastic can claim the $5 million spent preparing to perform the contracts.

Real Plastic should proceed with legal action to enforce its rights under the contracts and seek appropriate remedies for the breaches by Knock-Out and Copy Dog.
