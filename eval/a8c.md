### Legal Analysis of the Scenario

#### 1. Identification of Legal Issues

The primary legal issues in this scenario are:
1. **Breach of Contract**: Whether Tony's actions constitute a breach of the contract with Nick.
2. **Misrepresentation**: Whether Tony's assurances about the sourcing and finishes of the wood constitute misrepresentation.
3. **Remedies**: What remedies are available to Nick, including termination of the contract and recovery of damages.

#### 2. Applicable Laws

The applicable laws and legal principles include:
1. **Sale of Goods Ordinance (Cap. 26)**: This ordinance governs the sale of goods and includes implied terms regarding the quality and fitness of goods.
2. **Misrepresentation Ordinance (Cap. 284)**: This ordinance provides for remedies in cases of misrepresentation.
3. **Common Law Principles**: Including those related to breach of contract and remedies for breach.

#### 3. Application of Law to Facts

**Breach of Contract**

- **Express Terms**: The written agreement specifies the type of wood, delivery dates, amounts, and price but is silent on sourcing and paint/varnish requirements.
- **Implied Terms**: Under the Sale of Goods Ordinance (Cap. 26), there are implied conditions that goods supplied under a contract are of merchantable quality and fit for the purpose made known to the seller (Section 16(2) and (3)). Given Nick's explicit communication about his environmental policies, it can be argued that there is an implied term that the wood must be locally sourced and the finishes must be plant-based.
- **Breach**: Tony's use of non-local cedar and chemical-based finishes constitutes a breach of these implied terms. The breach is material as it goes to the heart of Nick's business model and reputation.

**Misrepresentation**

- **Representation**: Tony assured Nick that he could comply with the requirements for locally sourced wood and plant-based finishes.
- **Reliance**: Nick relied on these assurances when entering into the contract.
- **False Representation**: It has come to light that Tony did not comply with these assurances.
- **Remedies for Misrepresentation**: Under the Misrepresentation Ordinance (Cap. 284), Nick can seek damages for any loss suffered due to the misrepresentation. If the misrepresentation was fraudulent, Nick could also seek rescission of the contract.

**Remedies**

- **Termination**: Given the material breach of implied terms, Nick is entitled to terminate the contract. The breach undermines the entire basis of the agreement, making it impossible for Nick to continue his business as an ethical builder.
- **Damages**: Nick can claim damages for any loss suffered due to the breach. This includes any additional costs incurred in sourcing compliant materials and any loss of business or reputation.

#### Relevant Case Law

1. **Smith New Court Securities Ltd v Citibank NA [1997] AC 254**: This case outlines the measure of damages for deceit and misrepresentation, emphasizing that the aim is to put the plaintiff in the position they would have been in had the misrepresentation not occurred.
2. **Doyle v Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd [1969] 2 QB 158**: This case establishes that damages for fraudulent misrepresentation are not limited to those which are reasonably foreseeable but must directly flow from the misrepresentation.

#### Conclusion

Nick has strong grounds to terminate the contract with Tony based on the material breach of implied terms regarding the sourcing and finishes of the wood. Additionally, Nick can claim damages for any losses incurred due to the breach and misrepresentation. The applicable laws and case law support Nick's position, providing a basis for both termination and recovery of damages.
