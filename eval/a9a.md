### Legal Analysis of the Scenario

#### 1. Identification of Legal Issues

1. **Misrepresentation**: Whether Peter's statements about the ice-making machines, the lorries, and the company's financial health constitute misrepresentation.
2. **Breach of Contract**: Whether the destruction of the lorry and the malfunction of the ice-making machines constitute a breach of contract.
3. **Frustration of Contract**: Whether the unforeseen events (lorry fire and machine malfunction) frustrate the contract.
4. **Remedies**: What remedies are available to Cissy, including rescission, damages, or specific performance.

#### 2. Applicable Laws

1. **Misrepresentation Ordinance (Cap. 284)**: Governs the law of misrepresentation in Hong Kong.
2. **Sale of Goods Ordinance (Cap. 26)**: Governs the sale of goods and includes implied terms about the quality and fitness of goods.
3. **Common Law Principles**: Including those related to breach of contract and frustration of contract.

#### 3. Application of Law to Facts

##### Misrepresentation

**Types of Misrepresentation**:
- **Fraudulent Misrepresentation**: A false statement made knowingly, or without belief in its truth, or recklessly.
- **Negligent Misrepresentation**: A false statement made carelessly or without reasonable grounds for believing its truth.
- **Innocent Misrepresentation**: A false statement made without fault.

**Statements by Peter**:
1. **Ice-making machines**: Peter stated that the machines had been recently upgraded and required a tune-up every six months. This statement was made without knowledge of the misconfiguration by the engineers. This could be considered an innocent misrepresentation.
2. **Lorries**: Peter described the lorries as “seasoned and trusty” and “110% reliable”. Given that the lorries had not been serviced since 2015, this statement could be seen as negligent misrepresentation.
3. **Financial Health**: Peter showed Cissy the audited accounts for the financial year ending 31 March 2020, but omitted to mention the impact of the pandemic on the current financial year. This omission could be considered a negligent misrepresentation if Peter had a duty to disclose this information.

**Remedies for Misrepresentation**:
- **Rescission**: Cissy could seek to rescind the contract, returning both parties to their pre-contractual positions.
- **Damages**: If the misrepresentation is found to be negligent or fraudulent, Cissy could also claim damages.

##### Breach of Contract

**Destruction of the Lorry**:
- The contract included the lorries as part of the inventory list. The destruction of one lorry before the transfer of possession could be seen as a breach of contract.
- **Remedy**: Cissy could claim damages for the market value of the lorry ($300,000).

**Malfunction of Ice-making Machines**:
- The malfunction of the machines significantly impacts the business's ability to operate and generate revenue.
- **Remedy**: Cissy could claim damages for the loss of revenue ($250,000 per month) or seek to rescind the contract if the malfunction is deemed a fundamental breach.

##### Frustration of Contract

- **Doctrine of Frustration**: A contract may be discharged if an unforeseen event renders contractual obligations impossible or radically different from what was agreed.
- The destruction of the lorry and the malfunction of the machines could be argued as frustrating events, but frustration is a high threshold to meet.
- **Remedy**: If the contract is frustrated, both parties are released from their obligations, and any money paid may be recoverable.

#### 4. Conclusion

Cissy has several legal options:

1. **Rescission for Misrepresentation**: Cissy could seek to rescind the contract based on the misrepresentations made by Peter regarding the ice-making machines, the lorries, and the financial health of the company.
2. **Damages for Misrepresentation**: If the misrepresentations are found to be negligent or fraudulent, Cissy could claim damages.
3. **Damages for Breach of Contract**: Cissy could claim damages for the destruction of the lorry and the malfunction of the ice-making machines.
4. **Frustration of Contract**: Cissy could argue that the contract is frustrated due to the unforeseen events, though this is a less likely remedy given the high threshold for frustration.

Cissy should seek legal advice to determine the best course of action based on the specific facts and evidence available.
