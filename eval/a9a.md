#### 3. Application of Law to Facts

**Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd's Breach of Contract:**

- **Issue:** Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd failed to deliver the 1,000 plaster meerkat garden ornaments as per the contract.
- **Law:** Under the Sale of Goods Ordinance (Cap. 26), if a seller fails to deliver goods as per the contract, the buyer is entitled to damages for non-delivery (Section 51).
- **Application:** Sally had to find an alternative supplier at a lower cost (£1 per unit instead of £2 per unit). She also paid Bernard a 10% commission (£100). Sally's damages would be calculated based on the difference in cost and any additional expenses incurred due to the breach.
  - **Damages Calculation:**
    - Original cost: £2,000
    - New cost: £1,000
    - Commission: £100
    - Total cost incurred: £1,100
    - Savings: £900 (since the new cost is lower)
    - Sally may not be entitled to damages for the cost difference as she saved £900, but she can claim the commission paid to Bernard (£100).

**Nicky's Breach of Contract:**

- **Issue:** The waterfall features were six inches shorter than specified, affecting the 'splash and burble effect'.
- **Law:** Under common law, damages for breach of contract aim to put the innocent party in the position they would have been in had the contract been performed as agreed. The cost of rectification is considered if it is reasonable (Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd v Forsyth [1996] AC 344).
- **Application:** The cost to rectify the waterfall features is £20,000, which is disproportionate to the benefit gained (only detectable with scientific equipment). Following the principle in Ruxley, Sally may not be entitled to the full cost of rectification but could claim damages for the loss of amenity.
  - **Damages Calculation:**
    - Given the minimal impact on the 'splash and burble effect', Sally may be awarded nominal damages for the loss of amenity, rather than the full £20,000.

**Peter's Breach of Contract:**

- **Issue:** Peter sold the wedding photographs to a national newspaper, breaching the contract that specified all rights to the photographs remain with Sally.
- **Law:** Under the Copyright Ordinance (Cap. 528), the copyright owner has exclusive rights to the work. Breach of contract principles also apply, where damages aim to compensate for the loss suffered.
- **Application:** Sally had a potential deal with a glossy magazine for £20,000, which fell through due to Peter's unauthorized sale.
  - **Damages Calculation:**
    - Sally can claim the loss of the potential deal (£20,000) as damages, as this was a foreseeable consequence of Peter's breach.
    - Additionally, Sally may claim any profits Peter made from the unauthorized sale (£10,000) as restitution.

### Conclusion

- **Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd:** Sally can claim £100 for the commission paid to Bernard.
- **Nicky:** Sally may be awarded nominal damages for the loss of amenity, rather than the full £20,000 rectification cost.
- **Peter:** Sally can claim £20,000 for the lost magazine deal and potentially £10,000 as restitution for Peter's unauthorized sale.

This analysis provides a detailed assessment of the damages Sally may be entitled to under Hong Kong law for the breaches of contract by Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd, Nicky, and Peter.
