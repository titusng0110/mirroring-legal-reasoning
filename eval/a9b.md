# Contract Law: Whether Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd has breached the contract by failing to fulfil the order for 1,000 plaster meerkat garden ornaments

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 53

### Major Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 53

   Conditions:
   - The seller wrongfully neglects or refuses to deliver the goods to the buyer.
   - The buyer maintains an action against the seller for damages for non-delivery.

   Consequences:
   - The measure of damages is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the seller’s breach of contract.
   - Where there is an available market for the goods in question, the measure of damages is prima facie to be ascertained by the difference between the contract price and the market or current price of the goods at the time or times when they ought to have been delivered, or, if no time was fixed for delivery, then at the time of the neglect or refusal to deliver.

   Exceptions:
   - None specified.

### Minor Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 53:
- Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd has wrongfully neglected or refused to deliver the 1,000 plaster meerkat garden ornaments to Sally.
- Sally, the buyer, is maintaining an action against Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd for damages for non-delivery.
- The measure of damages is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting from Paul’s breach of contract.
- There is an available market for the plaster meerkat garden ornaments, as Sally was able to procure them from another supplier at £1 per unit.
- The contract price was £2,000 (£2 per unit), and the market price at the time of the breach was £1,000 (£1 per unit).

### Conclusion:

Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 53 applies, and the measure of damages is the difference between the contract price (£2,000) and the market price (£1,000), which is £1,000. Therefore, Sally is entitled to £1,000 in damages from Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd for non-delivery of the goods.

### Relevant law:

Richly Bright International Limited v De Monsa Investments Limited

### Major Premise:

1. Richly Bright International Limited v De Monsa Investments Limited

   Conditions:
   - A party sustains a loss by reason of a breach of contract
   - The damages may fairly and reasonably be considered either arising naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of things, from such breach of contract itself
   - Such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach of it

   Consequences:
   - The innocent party is entitled to an award of damages for breach of contract

   Exceptions:
   - The special circumstances under which the contract was actually made were wholly unknown to the party breaking the contract

### Minor Premise:

1. Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd:
- Sally has sustained a loss by reason of Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd's breach of contract (failure to fulfil the order for 1,000 plaster meerkat garden ornaments).
- The damages (additional cost of £100 for Bernard's commission) may fairly and reasonably be considered arising naturally from the breach of contract itself.
- The damages (additional cost of £100 for Bernard's commission) may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties at the time they made the contract as the probable result of the breach.
- There are no special circumstances under which the contract was made that were wholly unknown to Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd.

2. Nicky:
- Sally has sustained a loss by reason of Nicky's breach of contract (the waterfall features not meeting the specified height).
- The damages (cost of £20,000 to rectify the waterfall features) may not fairly and reasonably be considered arising naturally from the breach of contract itself, as the difference in 'splash and burble' is only detectable with scientific measuring equipment.
- The damages (cost of £20,000 to rectify the waterfall features) may not reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties at the time they made the contract as the probable result of the breach.
- There are no special circumstances under which the contract was made that were wholly unknown to Nicky.

3. Peter:
- Sally has sustained a loss by reason of Peter's breach of contract (selling the photographs to a national newspaper).
- The damages (loss of £20,000 from the glossy magazine deal) may fairly and reasonably be considered arising naturally from the breach of contract itself.
- The damages (loss of £20,000 from the glossy magazine deal) may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties at the time they made the contract as the probable result of the breach.
- There are no special circumstances under which the contract was made that were wholly unknown to Peter.

### Conclusion:

1. Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd has breached the contract, and Sally is entitled to an award of damages amounting to £100 for Bernard's commission.

2. Nicky has breached the contract, but Sally is not entitled to an award of damages for the cost of rectifying the waterfall features (£20,000) as the damages do not arise naturally from the breach and were not in the contemplation of both parties.

3. Peter has breached the contract, and Sally is entitled to an award of damages amounting to £20,000 for the loss of the glossy magazine deal.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA 136/2017 BETWEEN ZHAOQING KIDSTAR FOODS LIMITED. Plaintiff and UTILITY INDUSTRIAL LIMITED Defendant)
In the case of HCA 136/2017 BETWEEN ZHAOQING KIDSTAR FOODS LIMITED. Plaintiff and UTILITY INDUSTRIAL LIMITED Defendant (precedent p), the plaintiff, Zhaoqing Kidstar Foods Limited, entered into a contract with the defendant, Utility Industrial Limited, for the supply of goods. The defendant failed to deliver the goods as agreed, leading to a breach of contract. The court ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to damages for the non-delivery of goods, which included the difference in price for sourcing substitute goods and additional costs incurred due to the breach (outcome o).

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA 136/2017 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Breach of Contract**: In both cases, the defendant failed to fulfil their contractual obligations. In HCA 136/2017, Utility Industrial Limited did not deliver the goods as agreed. In our current case, Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd failed to fulfil the order for 1,000 plaster meerkat garden ornaments.
- **Mitigation of Damages**: In HCA 136/2017, the plaintiff mitigated their damages by sourcing substitute goods from another supplier. Similarly, in our current case, Sally mitigated her damages by finding an alternative supplier through Bernard.
- **Assessment of Damages**: In HCA 136/2017, the court assessed damages based on the difference in price between the original contract and the substitute goods, as well as additional costs incurred. In our current case, Sally incurred additional costs by paying Bernard a commission and the new supplier a higher price per unit.
- **Duty to Mitigate**: Both cases involve the principle that the plaintiff must take reasonable steps to mitigate their losses. In HCA 136/2017, the plaintiff took reasonable steps to find a substitute supplier. In our current case, Sally took reasonable steps by engaging Bernard to find an alternative supplier quickly.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA 136/2017)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a breach of contract involving non-delivery of goods, the court should decide that the plaintiff is entitled to damages that include the difference in price for substitute goods and any additional costs incurred due to the breach. This rule was justified in HCA 136/2017 because the positive effects (E+) of outcome o on the underlying values and principles of the law, such as ensuring that the non-breaching party is compensated for their losses and encouraging parties to fulfil their contractual obligations, outweigh the negative effects (E-) in that case. 

Applying this rule to our current case, Sally should be awarded damages that include the difference in price between the original contract (£2,000) and the cost of the substitute goods (£1,000), as well as the commission paid to Bernard (£100). This ensures that Sally is placed in the same financial position she would have been in had the contract been performed as agreed.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA 136/2017 BETWEEN ZHAOQING KIDSTAR FOODS LIMITED. Plaintiff and UTILITY INDUSTRIAL LIMITED Defendant) are present:

- **Breach of Contract**: In both cases, the defendant failed to fulfil their contractual obligations. In HCA 136/2017, Utility Industrial Limited did not deliver the goods as agreed. In our current case, Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd failed to fulfil the order for 1,000 plaster meerkat garden ornaments.
- **Mitigation of Damages**: In HCA 136/2017, the plaintiff mitigated their damages by sourcing substitute goods from another supplier. Similarly, in our current case, Sally mitigated her damages by finding an alternative supplier through Bernard.
- **Assessment of Damages**: In HCA 136/2017, the court assessed damages based on the difference in price between the original contract and the substitute goods, as well as additional costs incurred. In our current case, Sally incurred additional costs by paying Bernard a commission and the new supplier a higher price per unit.
- **Duty to Mitigate**: Both cases involve the principle that the plaintiff must take reasonable steps to mitigate their losses. In HCA 136/2017, the plaintiff took reasonable steps to find a substitute supplier. In our current case, Sally took reasonable steps by engaging Bernard to find an alternative supplier quickly.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA 136/2017, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Compensation for Losses**: Awarding damages that include the difference in price for substitute goods and any additional costs incurred ensures that Sally is placed in the same financial position she would have been in had the contract been performed as agreed. This aligns with the principle set out in Robinson v Harman (1848) 1 Exch 850, which aims to compensate the innocent party for their pecuniary loss.

2. **Encouraging Contractual Compliance**: By holding Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd accountable for their breach, the court reinforces the importance of fulfilling contractual obligations. This promotes trust and reliability in commercial transactions, which is essential for the smooth functioning of the market.

3. **Fairness and Reasonableness**: Sally took reasonable steps to mitigate her losses by quickly finding an alternative supplier through Bernard. Awarding her the additional costs incurred (the commission paid to Bernard and the higher price per unit) is fair and reasonable, as it reflects the actual financial impact of the breach on Sally.

4. **Legal Consistency**: Applying the same rule to similar fact patterns ensures consistency in the application of the law. This predictability is crucial for businesses and individuals when entering into contracts, as it allows them to understand the potential legal consequences of their actions.

Therefore, Sally should be awarded damages that include the difference in price between the original contract (£2,000) and the cost of the substitute goods (£1,000), as well as the commission paid to Bernard (£100). This ensures that Sally is compensated for her losses and reinforces the principles of fairness and contractual compliance.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, namely the breach of contract by Nicky in the landscaping of Sally's private water garden, that was not present in HCA 136/2017 BETWEEN ZHAOQING KIDSTAR FOODS LIMITED. Plaintiff and UTILITY INDUSTRIAL LIMITED Defendant. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of non-delivery of goods because it involves a different type of breach—defective performance rather than non-delivery.

Due to this factor, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as disproportionate financial burden on the defendant and potential unjust enrichment of the plaintiff. Unlike in HCA 136/2017, where the damages were straightforwardly calculated based on the difference in price for substitute goods and additional costs incurred, the cost of rectifying the waterfall features (£20,000) is significantly higher than the original contract price (£12,000) and the defect is minor, detectable only with scientific measuring equipment. Therefore, awarding the full cost of rectification would not be reasonable or proportionate. Instead, Sally may be entitled to a lesser amount that reflects the diminution in value or the loss of amenity caused by the breach, ensuring a fairer balance of interests.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA 136/2017 BETWEEN ZHAOQING KIDSTAR FOODS LIMITED. Plaintiff and UTILITY INDUSTRIAL LIMITED Defendant should be stated as: "When both [i*] (breach of contract involving non-delivery of goods) and [m] (the plaintiff taking reasonable steps to mitigate their losses by finding substitute goods) are present, the court should decide [o] (award damages that include the difference in price for substitute goods and any additional costs incurred)." Omitting [m] from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence [q] of plaintiffs not being incentivized to mitigate their losses, potentially leading to inflated claims and unfair financial burdens on defendants. Indeed, the opinion in HCA 136/2017 explicitly states that the plaintiff's duty to mitigate their losses was crucial to their decision, as it ensured that the damages awarded were fair and reasonable.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA 136/2017 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence [u] of plaintiffs not mitigating their losses and thus inflating their claims. However, in our current case involving Nicky's breach of contract in the landscaping of Sally's private water garden, there's no risk of [u] occurring. The issue here is not about non-delivery of goods but rather defective performance, where the cost of rectification is disproportionately high compared to the original contract price and the defect is minor. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—ensuring plaintiffs mitigate their losses—is not relevant to our situation. Instead, a more appropriate measure of damages would be the diminution in value or loss of amenity caused by the breach, ensuring a fairer balance of interests.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of the plaintiff taking reasonable steps to mitigate their losses by finding substitute goods (factor m), which was present in the precedent case HCA 136/2017 BETWEEN ZHAOQING KIDSTAR FOODS LIMITED. Plaintiff and UTILITY INDUSTRIAL LIMITED Defendant, requiring this factor for all similar cases of breach of contract involving non-delivery of goods (fact pattern i*) would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would unfairly penalize plaintiffs who, due to the nature of the breach, cannot mitigate their losses in the same manner. Conversely, not requiring factor m would allow for a more flexible and just approach to assessing damages, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, such as ensuring fair compensation for the innocent party and promoting contractual compliance.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of the plaintiff taking reasonable steps to mitigate their losses by finding substitute goods (factor m), which was present in HCA 136/2017, we have the additional factor of the plaintiff incurring additional costs due to the breach (factor n). This factor n, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of breach of contract involving non-delivery of goods (fact pattern i*), serves a similar function to factor m in the precedent case. Given the presence of factor n, we submit that the reasoning in HCA 136/2017 still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as ensuring fair compensation and promoting contractual compliance, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

In Sally's case, the additional costs incurred include the commission paid to Bernard (£100) and the higher price per unit paid to the new supplier (£1,000). These costs are directly attributable to the breach by Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd and should be considered in the assessment of damages. Therefore, Sally should be awarded damages that include these additional costs, ensuring she is placed in the same financial position she would have been in had the contract been performed as agreed. This approach aligns with the principles set out in Robinson v Harman and ensures a fair and reasonable outcome.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA 136/2017 BETWEEN ZHAOQING KIDSTAR FOODS LIMITED. Plaintiff and UTILITY INDUSTRIAL LIMITED Defendant, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in terms of breach of contract involving non-delivery of goods and the plaintiff's duty to mitigate damages. However, it also differs in significant ways, such as the nature of the breach by Nicky in the landscaping contract and the issue of defective performance rather than non-delivery.

The proposed legal rule of awarding damages that include the difference in price for substitute goods and any additional costs incurred finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of mitigating losses (as emphasized in the precedent) and the need for a fair and proportionate assessment of damages in cases of defective performance (as highlighted in the rebuttal arguments).

Considering the underlying legal principles of ensuring fair compensation for the innocent party, promoting contractual compliance, and maintaining legal consistency, we conclude that:

1. **Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd**: Sally should be awarded damages that include the difference in price between the original contract (£2,000) and the cost of the substitute goods (£1,000), as well as the commission paid to Bernard (£100). This ensures that Sally is compensated for her losses and aligns with the principles set out in Robinson v Harman and the precedent case.

2. **Nicky**: Given the minor nature of the defect in the waterfall features and the disproportionate cost of rectification (£20,000 compared to the original contract price of £12,000), Sally should not be awarded the full cost of rectification. Instead, she may be entitled to a lesser amount that reflects the diminution in value or the loss of amenity caused by the breach. This approach ensures a fairer balance of interests and avoids unjust enrichment.

3. **Peter**: Sally should be awarded damages for the loss of the exclusive run with the glossy magazine, which was valued at around £20,000. Peter's breach of contract by selling the photographs to a national newspaper directly caused this loss, and Sally is entitled to be placed in the same financial position she would have been in had the contract been performed as agreed.

In conclusion, the decision reached balances the need for legal consistency with the principles of fairness and proportionality, ensuring that Sally is fairly compensated for her losses while also promoting contractual compliance and reasonable mitigation of damages.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD)

In the case of FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD [2019] HKCFI 2373; HCA 1759/2018 (precedent p), the plaintiff and the defendant entered into a contract for the sale of goods. The plaintiff paid the full purchase price, but the goods delivered by the defendant were used and/or defective and not of merchantable quality. The plaintiff rejected the goods and demanded repayment. The court ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to damages for wasted expenditure, which included the amount paid under the contract and additional costs incurred due to the defendant's failure to take back the goods.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Breach of Contract**: In both cases, there was a breach of contract by the supplier. In the precedent case, the goods were defective and not of merchantable quality. In the current case, Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd failed to fulfil the order.
- **Wasted Expenditure**: In both cases, the innocent party incurred additional costs due to the breach. In the precedent case, the plaintiff incurred storage fees. In the current case, Sally incurred additional costs by paying a new supplier and a commission to Bernard.
- **Rejection of Goods**: In the precedent case, the plaintiff rejected the defective goods. In the current case, Sally had to find an alternative supplier due to the breach.
- **Damages for Non-Performance**: In both cases, the court considered the damages for non-performance of the contract. In the precedent case, the court awarded damages for the amount paid under the contract and additional costs. In the current case, Sally seeks damages for the additional costs incurred due to the breach.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see a breach of contract resulting in wasted expenditure and additional costs incurred by the innocent party, the court should decide to award damages for the amount paid under the contract and any additional costs incurred. This rule was justified in FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD because the positive effects of awarding damages for wasted expenditure and additional costs on the underlying values and principles of the law, such as fairness and compensation for loss, outweigh the negative effects. The court's decision ensures that the innocent party is made whole and that the breaching party is held accountable for their failure to perform the contract.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD) are present:

- **Breach of Contract**: In both cases, there was a breach of contract by the supplier. In the precedent case, the goods were defective and not of merchantable quality. In the current case, Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd failed to fulfil the order.
- **Wasted Expenditure**: In both cases, the innocent party incurred additional costs due to the breach. In the precedent case, the plaintiff incurred storage fees. In the current case, Sally incurred additional costs by paying a new supplier and a commission to Bernard.
- **Rejection of Goods**: In the precedent case, the plaintiff rejected the defective goods. In the current case, Sally had to find an alternative supplier due to the breach.
- **Damages for Non-Performance**: In both cases, the court considered the damages for non-performance of the contract. In the precedent case, the court awarded damages for the amount paid under the contract and additional costs. In the current case, Sally seeks damages for the additional costs incurred due to the breach.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Fairness and Compensation**: Awarding damages for the amount paid under the contract and additional costs incurred ensures that Sally is made whole and fairly compensated for her losses. This aligns with the principle of compensatory damages in contract law, which aims to put the innocent party in the position they would have been in had the contract been performed as agreed.

2. **Deterrence**: Holding Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd accountable for their breach of contract serves as a deterrent to other suppliers, promoting adherence to contractual obligations and fostering trust in commercial transactions.

3. **Economic Efficiency**: By awarding damages for wasted expenditure and additional costs, the court encourages efficient breach and mitigation of losses. Sally's prompt action to find an alternative supplier minimized her losses, and compensating her for the additional costs incurred supports this efficient behavior.

4. **Legal Consistency**: Applying the same rule to similar fact patterns ensures consistency in judicial decisions, which is a fundamental principle of common law systems. This consistency enhances predictability and stability in the law, allowing parties to better understand their rights and obligations under contracts.

Therefore, based on the shared fact patterns and the positive effects on the underlying values and principles of the law, the court should award Sally damages for the amount paid under the contract (£2,000) and the additional costs incurred (£1,000 for the new supplier and £100 commission to Bernard), totaling £3,100. This outcome aligns with the precedent set in FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD and upholds the principles of fairness, deterrence, economic efficiency, and legal consistency.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, **the commission paid to Bernard**, that was not present in [FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD]. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces an additional cost that was not directly related to the breach of contract by Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd. Due to this commission, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as **potentially encouraging unnecessary intermediary costs** than positive ones, unlike in [FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD] because in the precedent case, the additional costs were directly related to the breach (storage fees), whereas in our current case, the commission to Bernard is an indirect cost that Sally chose to incur. Therefore, the court may need to consider whether this commission should be recoverable as damages or if it falls outside the scope of direct losses caused by the breach.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from [FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD] should be stated as: "When both [a breach of contract resulting in wasted expenditure] and [additional costs directly related to mitigating the breach] are present, the court should decide [to award damages for the amount paid under the contract and any additional costs incurred]." Omitting [additional costs directly related to mitigating the breach] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of encouraging unnecessary intermediary costs and potentially inflating damages claims]. 

Indeed, the opinion in [FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD] explicitly states that the additional costs (storage fees) were directly related to the breach and necessary due to the defendant's failure to take back the goods. This direct relationship was crucial to their decision to award damages for those costs.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in [FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD] was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of leaving the innocent party uncompensated for necessary and direct additional costs incurred due to the breach. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because the commission paid to Bernard is an indirect cost that Sally chose to incur, rather than a necessary and direct cost resulting from the breach.

Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The commission to Bernard does not fall within the scope of direct losses caused by the breach, and including it in the damages would lead to the undesirable consequence of encouraging unnecessary intermediary costs. Thus, Sally should be awarded damages for the amount paid under the contract (£2,000) and the direct additional cost incurred (£1,000 for the new supplier), but not the £100 commission to Bernard.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction

While it's true that our case lacks the factor of "additional costs directly related to mitigating the breach," which was present in the precedent case [FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD], requiring this factor for all similar cases of breach of contract resulting in wasted expenditure would lead to the undesirable consequence of potentially encouraging unnecessary intermediary costs and inflating damages claims. Conversely, not requiring this factor would allow for a more equitable outcome, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, such as fairness and compensatory damages. By focusing on the direct losses caused by the breach, the court can ensure that the innocent party is fairly compensated without opening the door to claims for indirect or unnecessary costs.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution

Although our case lacks the factor of "additional costs directly related to mitigating the breach," which was present in [FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD], we have the additional factor of "the commission paid to Bernard." This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of breach of contract and wasted expenditure, serves a similar function to the additional costs in the precedent case. Given the presence of this commission, we submit that the reasoning in [FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD] still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as fairness and compensatory damages, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. Therefore, Sally should be awarded damages for the amount paid under the contract (£2,000) and the direct additional cost incurred (£1,000 for the new supplier), but not the £100 commission to Bernard.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations:

**Key Similarities:**
1. **Breach of Contract:** Both cases involve a breach of contract by the supplier.
2. **Wasted Expenditure:** Both cases involve the innocent party incurring additional costs due to the breach.
3. **Rejection of Goods:** In both cases, the innocent party had to take action due to the breach (rejection of goods in the precedent case and finding an alternative supplier in the current case).
4. **Damages for Non-Performance:** Both cases involve the court considering damages for non-performance of the contract.

**Key Differences:**
1. **Nature of Additional Costs:** In the precedent case, the additional costs (storage fees) were directly related to the breach. In the current case, the commission paid to Bernard is an indirect cost that Sally chose to incur.
2. **Type of Breach:** The precedent case involved defective goods, while the current case involves non-fulfillment of an order.

**Proposed Legal Rule:**
The rule from the precedent case suggests that when there is a breach of contract resulting in wasted expenditure and additional costs directly related to mitigating the breach, the court should award damages for the amount paid under the contract and any additional costs incurred.

**Assessment of Arguments:**
- **Initial Analogy (Steps 1-4):** The initial analogy correctly identifies the shared legal concepts and fact patterns, suggesting that Sally should be awarded damages for the amount paid under the contract and additional costs incurred.
- **Rebuttal Arguments (Steps 5-8):** The rebuttal arguments highlight the distinction that the commission paid to Bernard is an indirect cost and not directly related to the breach, suggesting that it should not be recoverable as damages.
- **Surrebuttal Arguments (Steps 9-10):** The surrebuttal arguments emphasize the importance of fairness and compensatory damages, suggesting that the commission to Bernard should be considered as part of the additional costs incurred due to the breach.

**Final Decision:**
Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, compensatory damages, and legal consistency, we conclude that Sally should be awarded damages for the amount paid under the contract (£2,000) and the direct additional cost incurred (£1,000 for the new supplier). However, the £100 commission paid to Bernard should not be included in the damages, as it is an indirect cost that Sally chose to incur and not a necessary and direct cost resulting from the breach.

**Reasoning:**
1. **Fairness and Compensation:** Awarding damages for the amount paid under the contract and the direct additional cost incurred ensures that Sally is fairly compensated for her losses without encouraging unnecessary intermediary costs.
2. **Deterrence:** Holding Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd accountable for their breach of contract serves as a deterrent to other suppliers, promoting adherence to contractual obligations.
3. **Economic Efficiency:** By compensating Sally for the direct additional cost incurred, the court encourages efficient breach and mitigation of losses.
4. **Legal Consistency:** Applying the same rule to similar fact patterns ensures consistency in judicial decisions, enhancing predictability and stability in the law.

Therefore, Sally is entitled to damages totaling £3,000 (£2,000 for the amount paid under the contract and £1,000 for the direct additional cost incurred), but not the £100 commission paid to Bernard. This outcome aligns with the precedent set in FEBEST EUROPE DISTRIBUTION OU v. ZHONG XING DA TECHNOLOGY CO, LTD and upholds the principles of fairness, deterrence, economic efficiency, and legal consistency.


# Contract Law: The measure of damages Sally can claim from Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd for the breach of contract

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 53

### Major Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 53

   Conditions:
   - The seller wrongfully neglects or refuses to deliver the goods to the buyer.

   Consequences:
   - The buyer may maintain an action against the seller for damages for non-delivery.
   - The measure of damages is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the seller’s breach of contract.
   - Where there is an available market for the goods in question, the measure of damages is prima facie to be ascertained by the difference between the contract price and the market or current price of the goods at the time or times when they ought to have been delivered, or, if no time was fixed for delivery, then at the time of the neglect or refusal to deliver.

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 53:
- Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd wrongfully neglected or refused to deliver the 1,000 plaster meerkat garden ornaments to Sally.
- Sally, the buyer, may maintain an action against Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd for damages for non-delivery.
- The measure of damages is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd’s breach of contract.
- There is an available market for the plaster meerkat garden ornaments, as Sally was able to find an alternative supplier at a price of £1 per unit.
- The measure of damages is prima facie to be ascertained by the difference between the contract price (£2,000) and the market or current price (£1,000) of the goods at the time they ought to have been delivered.

### Conclusion:

Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 53 applies, and Sally can claim damages from Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd for the difference between the contract price (£2,000) and the market price (£1,000), which amounts to £1,000. Additionally, Sally can claim the £100 commission paid to Bernard as it is a direct and natural consequence of the breach. Therefore, the total damages Sally can claim amount to £1,100.

## Deductive Reasoning: cfa

### Relevant law:

Richly Bright International Limited v De Monsa Investments Limited

### Major Premise:

1. Richly Bright International Limited v De Monsa Investments Limited

   Conditions:
   - A purchaser breaches a contract by failing to complete.
   - The vendor incurs losses exceeding the amount of the deposit.
   - The losses are within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time of the contract as the likely consequences of the breach.

   Consequences:
   - The purchaser is liable to damages for the balance of the losses exceeding the deposit.

   Exceptions:
   - The losses are remote and not within the reasonable contemplation of the parties.
   - The losses involve indemnities voluntarily given by the vendor in respect of losses incurred by parties to contracts further upstream.

### Minor Premise:

1. Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd breached the contract by failing to complete the order of 1,000 plaster meerkat garden ornaments.
2. Sally, the vendor, incurred losses exceeding the amount of the deposit. Specifically, she had to pay £1,000 to a new supplier and £100 in commission to Bernard, totaling £1,100.
3. These losses were within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time of the contract as the likely consequences of the breach, as it is foreseeable that Sally would need to find an alternative supplier and might incur additional costs.

### Conclusion:

Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd is liable to Sally for damages amounting to £1,100, which is the balance of the losses exceeding the deposit.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA 1190/2011 BETWEEN PRISM TECHNOLOGY LIMITED Plaintiff and TOPWIN & COMPANIES LIMITED Defendant)
In the case of HCA 1190/2011 BETWEEN PRISM TECHNOLOGY LIMITED Plaintiff and TOPWIN & COMPANIES LIMITED Defendant (precedent p), Prism Technology Limited (Prism) placed orders for PS3 headsets with Topwin & Companies Limited (Topwin). Topwin failed to deliver the headsets on time and in some cases did not deliver at all. The court ruled that Topwin was in breach of contract for late delivery and non-delivery, entitling Prism to treat the contract as repudiated and claim damages for loss of profit and additional costs incurred due to the breach (outcome o).

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA 1190/2011 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Breach of Contract**: In both cases, the defendant failed to fulfill their contractual obligations. In HCA 1190/2011, Topwin failed to deliver the headsets on time or at all. In the current case, Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd failed to fulfill Sally's order for garden ornaments.
- **Loss of Profit**: In both cases, the plaintiff claims loss of profit due to the breach. In HCA 1190/2011, Prism claimed loss of profit from the undelivered headsets. In the current case, Sally would have sold the garden ornaments for a profit.
- **Mitigation of Loss**: In both cases, the plaintiff took steps to mitigate their losses. In HCA 1190/2011, Prism sought alternative suppliers and incurred additional costs. In the current case, Sally found an alternative supplier through Bernard and incurred additional costs.
- **Additional Costs**: In both cases, the plaintiff incurred additional costs due to the breach. In HCA 1190/2011, Prism incurred airfreight costs. In the current case, Sally incurred costs for the new supplier and Bernard's commission.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA 1190/2011)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a breach of contract resulting in loss of profit and additional costs incurred to mitigate the loss, the court should decide to award damages to the plaintiff for the loss of profit and additional costs. This rule was justified in HCA 1190/2011 because the positive effects (E+) of outcome o on the underlying values and principles of the law, such as ensuring contractual obligations are met and compensating the innocent party for their losses, outweigh the negative effects (E-) in that case.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA 1190/2011 BETWEEN PRISM TECHNOLOGY LIMITED Plaintiff and TOPWIN & COMPANIES LIMITED Defendant) are present:

- **Breach of Contract**: In both cases, the defendant failed to fulfill their contractual obligations. In HCA 1190/2011, Topwin failed to deliver the headsets on time or at all. In the current case, Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd failed to fulfill Sally's order for garden ornaments.
- **Loss of Profit**: In both cases, the plaintiff claims loss of profit due to the breach. In HCA 1190/2011, Prism claimed loss of profit from the undelivered headsets. In the current case, Sally would have sold the garden ornaments for a profit of £2,000 (selling price of £4 each for 1,000 units).
- **Mitigation of Loss**: In both cases, the plaintiff took steps to mitigate their losses. In HCA 1190/2011, Prism sought alternative suppliers and incurred additional costs. In the current case, Sally found an alternative supplier through Bernard and incurred additional costs.
- **Additional Costs**: In both cases, the plaintiff incurred additional costs due to the breach. In HCA 1190/2011, Prism incurred airfreight costs. In the current case, Sally incurred costs for the new supplier (£1,000) and Bernard's commission (£100).

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCA 1190/2011. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Contractual Obligations are Met**: Awarding damages to Sally would reinforce the principle that parties must fulfill their contractual obligations or face financial consequences. This upholds the integrity of contractual agreements and promotes trust in commercial transactions.

2. **Compensating the Innocent Party**: Sally, as the innocent party, should be compensated for her losses resulting from the breach. This includes the loss of profit she would have made from selling the garden ornaments and the additional costs she incurred to mitigate her losses.

3. **Encouraging Mitigation of Losses**: By compensating Sally for the additional costs incurred in finding an alternative supplier, the court would encourage parties to take reasonable steps to mitigate their losses when a breach occurs. This promotes efficiency and reduces the overall economic impact of breaches.

4. **Fairness and Justice**: Awarding damages to Sally aligns with the principles of fairness and justice. It ensures that she is not left worse off due to the breach and that the breaching party, Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd, is held accountable for their failure to fulfill the contract.

Therefore, based on the shared legal concepts and fact patterns, the court should award Sally damages for the loss of profit (£2,000) and the additional costs incurred (£1,100). This decision would uphold the underlying values and principles of contract law, ensuring that contractual obligations are met, and innocent parties are fairly compensated for their losses.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the breach of contract by Nicky in the landscaping of Sally's private water garden, that was not present in HCA 1190/2011 BETWEEN PRISM TECHNOLOGY LIMITED Plaintiff and TOPWIN & COMPANIES LIMITED Defendant. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of breach of contract and loss of profit.

In the precedent case, the primary issues were late delivery and non-delivery of goods, which directly impacted the plaintiff's ability to fulfill their own contractual obligations and resulted in financial losses. The court awarded damages based on the loss of profit and additional costs incurred due to the breach.

However, in our current case, the breach by Nicky involves a failure to meet the specified height of the waterfall features in Sally's private water garden, resulting in a less-than-expected "splash and burble effect." The cost of rectifying this issue would be £20,000, which is significantly higher than the original contract price of £12,000. The difference in the "splash and burble effect" can only be detected with scientific measuring equipment, indicating that the breach is minor and does not substantially affect the overall functionality or enjoyment of the water garden.

Due to this factor, applying the same outcome (awarding full rectification costs) in our case would have more negative consequences, such as imposing an unreasonable financial burden on Nicky for a minor deviation that does not significantly impact the contract's purpose. Unlike in HCA 1190/2011, where the breach directly affected the plaintiff's business operations and profitability, the breach in our current case is more about aesthetic preference and does not justify the disproportionate cost of rectification.

Therefore, the court should consider awarding damages that reflect the minor nature of the breach and the actual impact on Sally, rather than the full cost of rectification. This approach would ensure a fair and reasonable outcome, balancing the interests of both parties.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA 1190/2011 BETWEEN PRISM TECHNOLOGY LIMITED Plaintiff and TOPWIN & COMPANIES LIMITED Defendant should be stated as: "When both [breach of contract resulting in loss of profit and additional costs incurred to mitigate the loss] and [the breach directly impacts the plaintiff's business operations and profitability] are present, the court should decide [to award damages for the loss of profit and additional costs]." Omitting [the breach directly impacts the plaintiff's business operations and profitability] from this rule could lead to [an undesirable consequence where plaintiffs are awarded disproportionate damages for minor breaches that do not significantly impact their business or contractual purpose]. Indeed, the opinion in HCA 1190/2011 explicitly states that the breach directly affected Prism's ability to fulfill their own contractual obligations and resulted in financial losses, which was crucial to their decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA 1190/2011 was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of plaintiffs being left uncompensated for significant financial losses directly resulting from a breach of contract that impacts their business operations]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [Sally being left uncompensated for significant financial losses due to the minor deviation in the waterfall features]. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Sally's case with Nicky involves a minor aesthetic issue that does not justify the disproportionate cost of rectification, unlike the significant business impact seen in HCA 1190/2011.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of "the breach directly impacting the plaintiff's business operations and profitability," which was present in the precedent case HCA 1190/2011 BETWEEN PRISM TECHNOLOGY LIMITED Plaintiff and TOPWIN & COMPANIES LIMITED Defendant, requiring this factor for all similar cases of breach of contract resulting in loss of profit and additional costs incurred to mitigate the loss would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would mean that plaintiffs who suffer from breaches that do not directly impact their business operations but still incur significant costs and losses would be left uncompensated. Conversely, not requiring this factor would allow for a more equitable outcome, ensuring that all plaintiffs who incur additional costs and losses due to a breach of contract are fairly compensated. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which aim to ensure that the innocent party is put in the position they would have been in had the contract been performed as agreed.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of "the breach directly impacting the plaintiff's business operations and profitability," which was present in HCA 1190/2011, we have the additional factor of "the breach involving a minor deviation that does not significantly impact the contract's purpose." This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of breach of contract resulting in loss of profit and additional costs incurred to mitigate the loss, serves a similar function to the factor in the precedent case. Given the presence of this additional factor, we submit that the reasoning in HCA 1190/2011 still applies, as the positive effects on ensuring contractual obligations are met, compensating the innocent party, and encouraging mitigation of losses would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. This approach ensures fairness and justice by compensating Sally for her actual losses while avoiding disproportionate financial burdens on the breaching party for minor deviations.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA 1190/2011 BETWEEN PRISM TECHNOLOGY LIMITED Plaintiff and TOPWIN & COMPANIES LIMITED Defendant, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the breach of contract resulting in loss of profit and additional costs incurred to mitigate the loss. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly with the nature of the breach involving Nicky and the landscaping of Sally's private water garden, which is more about aesthetic preference and does not justify the disproportionate cost of rectification.

The proposed legal rule of awarding damages for the loss of profit and additional costs finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the breach directly impacting the plaintiff's business operations and profitability was crucial in the precedent case, and the counterargument that minor deviations should not result in disproportionate financial burdens.

Considering the underlying legal principles of ensuring contractual obligations are met, compensating the innocent party, and encouraging mitigation of losses, we conclude that:

1. **Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd**: Sally should be awarded damages for the loss of profit (£2,000) and the additional costs incurred (£1,100) due to the breach of contract. This aligns with the precedent and ensures that Sally is compensated for her actual losses.

2. **Nicky**: Sally should not be awarded the full cost of rectification (£20,000) for the minor deviation in the waterfall features. Instead, damages should reflect the minor nature of the breach and the actual impact on Sally. Given that the difference in the "splash and burble effect" can only be detected with scientific measuring equipment, a nominal sum or a small percentage of the rectification cost may be more appropriate to acknowledge the breach without imposing an unreasonable financial burden on Nicky.

3. **Peter**: Sally should be awarded damages for the loss of the exclusive run with the glossy magazine, which was valued at around £20,000. Peter's breach of contract by selling the photographs to a national newspaper directly caused this loss, and Sally should be compensated accordingly.

In conclusion, the decision reached balances the need to uphold legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency. Sally is compensated for her actual losses due to the breaches of contract by Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd and Peter, while the damages awarded for Nicky's breach are proportionate to the minor nature of the deviation. This approach ensures fairness and aligns with the principles of contract law.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司)

In the case of CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司 (precedent p), the Plaintiff claimed damages due to the Defendant’s breach of a Restructuring Agreement. The court ruled that the Plaintiff was entitled to damages on a reliance loss basis, amounting to HK$7,228,270, which included professional fees incurred in reliance upon the promised performance of the Defendant under the Restructuring Agreement, as well as costs incurred in mitigating the loss suffered as a result of the Defendant’s breach.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Breach of Contract**: In both cases, there is a clear breach of contract by one party. In the precedent case, the Defendant breached the Restructuring Agreement. In the current case, Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd breached the contract by failing to fulfil the order for meerkat garden ornaments.
- **Reliance Loss**: Both cases involve the innocent party incurring costs in reliance on the contract being performed. In the precedent case, the Plaintiff incurred professional fees. In the current case, Sally incurred additional costs to find an alternative supplier and paid a commission to Bernard.
- **Mitigation of Loss**: Both cases involve the innocent party taking steps to mitigate their losses. In the precedent case, the Plaintiff incurred costs in efforts to mitigate the loss caused by the Defendant’s breach. In the current case, Sally mitigated her loss by finding an alternative supplier through Bernard.
- **Assessment of Damages**: In both cases, the court assesses damages based on the costs incurred due to the breach. In the precedent case, the court awarded damages for professional fees and mitigation costs. In the current case, Sally seeks to recover the additional costs incurred due to the breach.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a breach of contract leading to reliance loss and mitigation efforts, the court should decide to award damages to cover the costs incurred by the innocent party. This rule was justified in CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司 because the positive effects of awarding damages (E+) on the underlying values and principles of the law, such as fairness and the protection of the innocent party’s reliance interest, outweigh the negative effects (E-) in that case.

Therefore, applying this rule to Sally’s case, she should be entitled to recover the additional costs incurred in finding an alternative supplier from Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd, as these costs were incurred in reliance on the contract being performed and in efforts to mitigate her loss.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司) are present:

- **Breach of Contract**: In both cases, there is a clear breach of contract by one party. In the precedent case, the Defendant breached the Restructuring Agreement. In the current case, Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd breached the contract by failing to fulfil the order for meerkat garden ornaments.
- **Reliance Loss**: Both cases involve the innocent party incurring costs in reliance on the contract being performed. In the precedent case, the Plaintiff incurred professional fees. In the current case, Sally incurred additional costs to find an alternative supplier and paid a commission to Bernard.
- **Mitigation of Loss**: Both cases involve the innocent party taking steps to mitigate their losses. In the precedent case, the Plaintiff incurred costs in efforts to mitigate the loss caused by the Defendant’s breach. In the current case, Sally mitigated her loss by finding an alternative supplier through Bernard.
- **Assessment of Damages**: In both cases, the court assesses damages based on the costs incurred due to the breach. In the precedent case, the court awarded damages for professional fees and mitigation costs. In the current case, Sally seeks to recover the additional costs incurred due to the breach.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome: awarding damages to cover the costs incurred by the innocent party. This decision would be justified because, as in CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Fairness**: Awarding damages ensures that Sally is placed in the same situation, with respect to damages, as if the contract had been performed. This aligns with the principle that the innocent party should not suffer due to the breach of contract by the other party.
2. **Protection of Reliance Interest**: By awarding damages, the court protects Sally’s reliance interest, ensuring that the costs she incurred in reliance on the contract being performed are reimbursed.
3. **Encouragement of Mitigation**: Recognising and compensating the efforts made by Sally to mitigate her losses encourages parties to take reasonable steps to reduce their losses in the event of a breach.
4. **Deterrence**: Awarding damages in such cases serves as a deterrent to other parties, discouraging them from breaching contracts and ensuring they fulfil their contractual obligations.

Therefore, applying the rule from the precedent case to Sally’s situation, the court should award her damages to cover the additional costs incurred in finding an alternative supplier, as well as the commission paid to Bernard. This would ensure that Sally is fairly compensated for the breach of contract by Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the Plaintiff had incurred substantial professional fees in reliance on the Defendant's promised performance under the Restructuring Agreement. This reliance loss was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling (compensating the Plaintiff for wasted expenditure) outweighed any potential drawbacks (such as the Defendant's financial burden) because it directly addressed the Plaintiff's financial outlay that was wasted due to the Defendant's breach.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of substantial professional fees incurred in reliance on the contract is notably absent. Sally's additional costs are related to finding an alternative supplier and paying a commission to Bernard, which are not as substantial or complex as the professional fees incurred in the precedent case. This difference in the nature and extent of the reliance loss may affect the court's assessment of damages.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in **CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司**: the issue of specific performance in the context of the waterfall features commissioned by Sally. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of reliance loss and mitigation efforts.

In Sally's case, the cost of rectifying the waterfall features to meet the contractual specification is disproportionately high (£20,000) compared to the original contract price (£12,000). This introduces a consideration of whether the court should award damages for the cost of rectification or for the diminution in value due to the breach. The presence of this factor means that applying the same outcome (awarding reliance loss damages) in our case would have more negative consequences, such as potentially awarding an excessive amount for rectification, than positive ones. This is unlike in **CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司**, where the damages were directly tied to the professional fees incurred and were more straightforward to quantify and justify.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司** should be stated as: "When both [i*] (breach of contract leading to reliance loss and mitigation efforts) and [m] (substantial professional fees incurred in reliance on the contract) are present, the court should decide [o] (to award damages to cover the costs incurred by the innocent party)." Omitting [m] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q] (awarding excessive or unjustified damages for minor or less substantial reliance losses). Indeed, the opinion in **CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司** explicitly states that the substantial professional fees incurred were crucial to their decision to award damages on a reliance loss basis.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司** was clearly designed to prevent [undesirable consequence u] (the innocent party being left uncompensated for substantial reliance losses incurred due to the breach of contract). However, in our current case, there's no risk of [u] occurring because Sally's additional costs for finding an alternative supplier and paying a commission to Bernard are not as substantial or complex as the professional fees incurred in the precedent case. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves (compensating substantial reliance losses) is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should consider the proportionality and reasonableness of the damages claimed by Sally in light of the actual costs incurred.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the substantial professional fees incurred in reliance on the contract (factor m), which was present in the precedent case **CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of breach of contract leading to reliance loss and mitigation efforts (fact pattern i*) would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would mean that only cases involving substantial professional fees could recover reliance losses, potentially leaving other innocent parties uncompensated for their reasonable mitigation efforts and reliance expenditures. Conversely, not requiring the presence of substantial professional fees would allow for a more equitable outcome, ensuring that all innocent parties who incur reasonable costs in reliance on a contract and in mitigating their losses can be compensated. This better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, which aim to place the innocent party in the same situation, with respect to damages, as if the contract had been performed, and to encourage reasonable mitigation efforts.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the substantial professional fees incurred in reliance on the contract (factor m), which was present in **CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司**, we have the additional factor of Sally's reasonable mitigation efforts and the costs incurred in finding an alternative supplier and paying a commission to Bernard (factor n). This factor n, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of breach of contract leading to reliance loss and mitigation efforts (fact pattern i*), serves a similar function to factor m in the precedent case. Given the presence of factor n, we submit that the reasoning in **CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司** still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as fairness, protection of reliance interest, and encouragement of mitigation, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. Therefore, Sally should be entitled to recover the additional costs incurred in finding an alternative supplier and the commission paid to Bernard from Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **CHANGGANG DUNXIN ENTERPRISE CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. 北京精准溝通傳媒科技股份有限公司**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations.

**Key Similarities:**
1. **Breach of Contract**: Both cases involve a clear breach of contract by one party.
2. **Reliance Loss**: Both cases involve the innocent party incurring costs in reliance on the contract being performed.
3. **Mitigation of Loss**: Both cases involve the innocent party taking steps to mitigate their losses.
4. **Assessment of Damages**: In both cases, the court assesses damages based on the costs incurred due to the breach.

**Key Differences:**
1. **Nature of Costs**: In the precedent case, the costs were substantial professional fees, whereas in the current case, the costs are related to finding an alternative supplier and paying a commission.
2. **Specific Performance Issue**: The current case involves an additional issue of specific performance related to the waterfall features, which was not present in the precedent case.

**Proposed Legal Rule:**
The proposed legal rule from the precedent case is that when there is a breach of contract leading to reliance loss and mitigation efforts, the court should award damages to cover the costs incurred by the innocent party.

**Strong Points from Each Side:**
- **For Applying the Rule**: The reliance loss and mitigation efforts in both cases justify awarding damages to cover the costs incurred by the innocent party. This aligns with the principles of fairness and protection of reliance interest.
- **Against Applying the Rule**: The absence of substantial professional fees in the current case and the issue of specific performance related to the waterfall features suggest that the rule may not be directly applicable. The proportionality and reasonableness of the damages claimed should be considered.

**Relevant Legal Principles:**
- **Fairness**: Ensuring that the innocent party is placed in the same situation, with respect to damages, as if the contract had been performed.
- **Protection of Reliance Interest**: Compensating the innocent party for costs incurred in reliance on the contract being performed.
- **Encouragement of Mitigation**: Recognising and compensating reasonable efforts to mitigate losses.

**Conclusion:**
Considering the underlying legal principles and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Sally should be entitled to recover the additional costs incurred in finding an alternative supplier and the commission paid to Bernard from Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd. This decision aligns with the principles of fairness, protection of reliance interest, and encouragement of mitigation, as established in the precedent case. However, the court should also consider the proportionality and reasonableness of the damages claimed, particularly in relation to the specific performance issue with the waterfall features. Therefore, Sally should be awarded damages for the additional costs incurred due to the breach of contract by Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd, but the court should carefully assess the claim for rectification costs related to the waterfall features to ensure that the damages awarded are reasonable and proportionate.


# Contract Law: Whether Sally can recover the commission paid to Bernard from Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2 and 3

### Major Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - A contract governed by law applicable to the Colony has become impossible of performance or been otherwise frustrated.
   - The parties thereto have for that reason been discharged from the further performance of the contract.

   Consequences:
   - All sums paid or payable to any party in pursuance of the contract before the time when the parties were so discharged shall, in the case of sums so paid, be recoverable from him as money received by him for the use of the party by whom the sums were paid.
   - In the case of sums so payable, cease to be so payable.

   Exceptions:
   - If the party to whom the sums were so paid or payable incurred expenses before the time of discharge in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, the court may, if it considers it just to do so having regard to all the circumstances of the case, allow him to retain or, as the case may be, recover the whole or any part of the sums so paid or payable, not being an amount in excess of the expenses so incurred.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3

   Conditions:
   - Any party to the contract has, by reason of anything done by any other party thereto in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, obtained a valuable benefit (other than a payment of money to which subsection (2) applies) before the time of discharge.

   Consequences:
   - There shall be recoverable from him by the said other party such sum (if any), not exceeding the value of the said benefit to the party obtaining it, as the court considers just, having regard to all the circumstances of the case.

   Exceptions:
   - None

### Minor Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2:
- Sally placed an order for 1,000 plaster meerkat garden ornaments from Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd at a cost of £2,000.
- Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd are unable to fulfil the latest order, making the contract impossible of performance.
- The parties (Sally and Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd) have been discharged from further performance of the contract.
- Sally paid Bernard £100 in commission to find an alternative supplier due to the frustration of the contract.
- Sally paid the new supplier £1,000 for the meerkats.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3:
- Sally obtained a valuable benefit (the alternative supply of meerkats at £1 per unit) due to Bernard's efforts.
- The benefit obtained by Sally is not a payment of money to which subsection (2) applies.

### Conclusion:

Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2 applies, and Sally can recover the commission paid to Bernard from Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd as part of the sums paid in pursuance of the contract before the time of discharge. The court may consider allowing Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd to retain or recover part of the sums if they incurred expenses before the time of discharge, but this does not affect Sally's right to recover the commission paid to Bernard.

## Deductive Reasoning: cfa

### Relevant law:

Richly Bright International Limited v De Monsa Investments Limited

### Major Premise:

1. Richly Bright International Limited v De Monsa Investments Limited

   Conditions:
   - A party breaches a contract.
   - The innocent party incurs additional costs to mitigate the loss caused by the breach.
   - The additional costs are reasonably foreseeable as a consequence of the breach.

   Consequences:
   - The innocent party may recover the additional costs incurred as damages.

   Exceptions:
   - The additional costs are deemed too remote or unforeseeable.

### Minor Premise:

1. Richly Bright International Limited v De Monsa Investments Limited:
- Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd breached the contract by failing to fulfil Sally's order for 1,000 plaster meerkat garden ornaments.
- Sally incurred additional costs to mitigate the loss caused by the breach by paying Bernard a 10 per cent commission (£100) to find an alternative supplier.
- The additional costs (commission paid to Bernard) are reasonably foreseeable as a consequence of the breach because it is a common business practice to seek alternative suppliers when an order cannot be fulfilled.

### Conclusion:

Richly Bright International Limited v De Monsa Investments Limited applies, and Sally can recover the commission paid to Bernard (£100) from Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd as damages.


# Contract Law: Whether the reduction in the height of the waterfall features constitutes a breach of contract by Nicky

## Deductive Reasoning: cfi

### Relevant law:

Ho Kwai Chun v Wong King Man and Bellgrove v Eldridge (1954) 90 CLR 613

### Major Premise:

1. Ho Kwai Chun v Wong King Man

   Conditions:
   - A contract provides for a specific sum to be paid on completion of specific work.
   - The contractor has bona fide completed the project but there are subsequent defects, quite possibly minor.

   Consequences:
   - The contractor is entitled to payment subject to adjustments and reductions for defects.

   Exceptions:
   - The defects are not minor, in which case the employer may not be required to pay the lump sum price.

2. Bellgrove v Eldridge (1954) 90 CLR 613

   Conditions:
   - The work undertaken is necessary to produce conformity with the contract.
   - It is a reasonable course to adopt.

   Consequences:
   - The measure of damages recoverable is the cost of making the work conform to the contract.

   Exceptions:
   - The cost of reinstatement is unreasonable in relation to the loss sustained.

### Minor Premise:

1. Ho Kwai Chun v Wong King Man:
   - The contract between Sally and Nicky provides for a specific sum (£12,000) to be paid on completion of the landscaping work.
   - Nicky has bona fide completed the project, but the height of the waterfall features is six inches less than specified.
   - The difference in the 'splash and burble effect' can only be detected with scientific measuring equipment, indicating the defect is minor.

   Therefore, Nicky is entitled to payment subject to adjustments and reductions for the minor defect.

2. Bellgrove v Eldridge (1954) 90 CLR 613:
   - The work undertaken (landscaping the water garden) is necessary to produce conformity with the contract.
   - The cost of putting the waterfall features right would be £20,000, which is unreasonable in relation to the loss sustained (the minor difference in 'splash and burble effect').

   Therefore, the measure of damages recoverable should not be the cost of reinstatement as it is unreasonable.

### Conclusion:

The reduction in the height of the waterfall features constitutes a breach of contract by Nicky. However, the defect is minor, and the cost of reinstatement is unreasonable in relation to the loss sustained. Therefore, Nicky is entitled to payment subject to adjustments and reductions for the minor defect.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS)
In the case of SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS (precedent p), the court dealt with claims made by the contractor for outstanding costs of works carried out and counterclaims by the owners for damages due to allegedly defective works. The court ruled that expert evidence must be properly adduced with the court's leave and that the expert's opinion must be based on comprehensive and disclosed facts. The court excluded certain reports as inadmissible because leave was not obtained to adduce them as expert evidence.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Breach of Contract**: In both cases, there is an alleged breach of contract. In the precedent case, the contractor allegedly failed to complete the works and performed defective works. In the current case, Nicky allegedly failed to meet the contractual specification for the waterfall features.
- **Legal Concept 2: Expert Evidence**: In the precedent case, the court emphasized the importance of properly adduced expert evidence to support claims of defective work. In the current case, expert evidence might be necessary to determine the extent of the defect in the waterfall features and the cost of rectification.
- **Legal Concept 3: Damages Assessment**: In the precedent case, the court considered the reasonable costs of rectification of defects. In the current case, Sally seeks damages for the cost of rectifying the waterfall features to meet the contractual specification.
- **Legal Concept 4: Contractual Compliance**: In both cases, the issue revolves around whether the work performed complied with the contractual requirements. In the precedent case, the contractor's work was allegedly non-compliant. In the current case, the waterfall features do not meet the specified height.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern involving a breach of contract due to non-compliance with contractual specifications and the need for expert evidence to assess the extent of the defect and the cost of rectification, the court should decide to award damages based on the reasonable costs of rectification. This rule was justified in SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS because the court emphasized the importance of properly adduced expert evidence to ensure a fair assessment of the defects and the associated costs, thereby upholding the principles of mutuality and fairness in contractual obligations.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Breach of Contract**: In both cases, there is an alleged breach of contract. In the precedent case, the contractor allegedly failed to complete the works and performed defective works. In the current case, Nicky allegedly failed to meet the contractual specification for the waterfall features.
- **Legal Concept 2: Expert Evidence**: In the precedent case, the court emphasized the importance of properly adduced expert evidence to support claims of defective work. In the current case, expert evidence might be necessary to determine the extent of the defect in the waterfall features and the cost of rectification.
- **Legal Concept 3: Damages Assessment**: In the precedent case, the court considered the reasonable costs of rectification of defects. In the current case, Sally seeks damages for the cost of rectifying the waterfall features to meet the contractual specification.
- **Legal Concept 4: Contractual Compliance**: In both cases, the issue revolves around whether the work performed complied with the contractual requirements. In the precedent case, the contractor's work was allegedly non-compliant. In the current case, the waterfall features do not meet the specified height.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome: awarding damages based on the reasonable costs of rectification. This decision would be justified because, as in SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Contractual Obligations**: Ensuring that parties adhere to the terms of their contracts promotes fairness and reliability in commercial transactions. Awarding damages for rectification costs reinforces the importance of meeting contractual specifications.
   
2. **Encouraging Proper Performance**: By holding contractors accountable for defective work, the court incentivizes proper performance and diligence in fulfilling contractual obligations. This aligns with the principles of mutuality and fairness in contractual relationships.

3. **Facilitating Dispute Resolution**: Properly adduced expert evidence helps narrow down disputes to core issues, minimizing costs and time for all parties involved. This promotes efficient and effective dispute resolution, which is a key objective of the legal system.

4. **Ensuring Fair Compensation**: Awarding damages based on the reasonable costs of rectification ensures that the innocent party is fairly compensated for the breach, restoring them to the position they would have been in had the contract been properly performed.

Therefore, applying the rule from the precedent case to the current case would uphold the underlying values and principles of contract law, ensuring fairness, accountability, and efficient dispute resolution.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of properly adduced expert evidence. This expert evidence was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as accurate assessment of defects and fair compensation for rectification costs, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it provided a clear, objective basis for determining the extent of the defects and the reasonable costs of rectification. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of properly adduced expert evidence is notably absent as there is no indication that Sally has obtained or presented expert evidence to support her claim regarding the waterfall features' defect and the associated rectification costs.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor of Sally's potential loss of a lucrative magazine deal due to Peter's breach of contract, which was not present in SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it introduces a claim for consequential damages due to lost business opportunities. Due to this factor, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as undercompensating Sally for her actual losses, unlike in SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS, because the precedent case did not involve consequential damages arising from a breach of contract.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS** should be stated as: "When both [a breach of contract due to non-compliance with contractual specifications] and [properly adduced expert evidence to support claims of defective work] are present, the court should decide [to award damages based on the reasonable costs of rectification]." Omitting [properly adduced expert evidence] from this rule could lead to [an undesirable consequence of inaccurate assessment of defects and unfair compensation]. Indeed, the opinion in **SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS** explicitly states that [the importance of properly adduced expert evidence was crucial to their decision].

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of inaccurate assessment of defects and unfair compensation]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [inaccurate assessment of defects] occurring because the defect in the waterfall features is minor and can only be detected with scientific measuring equipment. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of properly adduced expert evidence, which was present in the precedent case SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS, requiring this factor for all similar cases of breach of contract due to non-compliance with contractual specifications would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would place an undue burden on parties to always obtain expert evidence, even in cases where the defect is minor and can be objectively assessed without such evidence. Conversely, not requiring properly adduced expert evidence in cases where the defect is minor and easily detectable would allow for a more efficient resolution of disputes and reduce unnecessary litigation costs. This approach better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, which aim to ensure fairness, efficiency, and proportionality in the resolution of contractual disputes.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of properly adduced expert evidence, which was present in SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS, we have the additional factor of Sally's potential loss of a lucrative magazine deal due to Peter's breach of contract. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of breach of contract and the need for damages assessment, serves a similar function to the expert evidence in the precedent case. Given the presence of this consequential loss, we submit that the reasoning in SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS still applies, as the positive effects on ensuring fair compensation and upholding contractual obligations would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **SUN CHEONG CONSTRUCTION CO LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KING FU, HO FU, KI FU & KA FU BUILDINGS**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations:

1. **Key Similarities**: Both cases involve a breach of contract due to non-compliance with contractual specifications and the need for damages assessment. In both instances, the issue revolves around whether the work performed complied with the contractual requirements.

2. **Key Differences**: The precedent case heavily relied on properly adduced expert evidence to support claims of defective work, which is absent in the current case. Additionally, the current case involves a consequential loss due to Peter's breach of contract, which was not present in the precedent case.

3. **Proposed Legal Rule**: The rule from the precedent case suggests that when there is a breach of contract due to non-compliance with contractual specifications and properly adduced expert evidence, the court should award damages based on the reasonable costs of rectification.

4. **Broader Implications**: Requiring properly adduced expert evidence in all similar cases could place an undue burden on parties, especially when the defect is minor and can be objectively assessed without such evidence. Conversely, not requiring expert evidence in cases where the defect is minor and easily detectable would allow for a more efficient resolution of disputes and reduce unnecessary litigation costs.

5. **Strong Points from Both Sides**:
   - **For Requiring Expert Evidence**: Ensures accurate assessment of defects and fair compensation, upholding the principles of mutuality and fairness in contractual obligations.
   - **Against Requiring Expert Evidence**: In cases of minor defects, it would place an undue burden on parties and lead to unnecessary litigation costs.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, efficiency, and proportionality in the resolution of contractual disputes, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that:

**The court should award damages based on the reasonable costs of rectification without strictly requiring properly adduced expert evidence in cases where the defect is minor and can be objectively assessed. Additionally, Sally should be compensated for the consequential loss due to Peter's breach of contract, as it directly resulted in a lost business opportunity.**

This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by ensuring fair compensation and upholding contractual obligations without imposing unnecessary burdens on the parties involved.


# Contract Law: Whether the breach by Nicky is substantial enough to warrant damages

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 53 and Section 55
Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 13A

### Major Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 53

   Conditions:
   - The seller wrongfully neglects or refuses to deliver the goods to the buyer
   - The buyer has suffered loss as a result

   Consequences:
   - The buyer may maintain an action against the seller for damages for non-delivery
   - The measure of damages is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the seller’s breach of contract
   - Where there is an available market for the goods in question, the measure of damages is prima facie to be ascertained by the difference between the contract price and the market or current price of the goods at the time or times when they ought to have been delivered, or, if no time was fixed for delivery, then at the time of the neglect or refusal to deliver

   Exceptions:
   - None

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 13A

   Conditions:
   - A court is assessing damages for breach of a contract of which there has been part performance
   - An order for specific performance could not, in the circumstances of the case, be made by the court

   Consequences:
   - The court may award damages for breach of the contract

   Exceptions:
   - This section shall not apply to any contract made before 31 December 1972

### Minor Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 53:
- Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd wrongfully neglected or refused to deliver the 1,000 plaster meerkat garden ornaments to Sally.
- Sally has suffered loss as a result, as she had to find an alternative supplier and incurred additional costs.
- Sally paid £1,000 to the new supplier and £100 in commission to Bernard, totalling £1,100.
- The contract price with Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd was £2,000, and the market price she paid was £1,000, resulting in a difference of £1,000.
- Therefore, Sally can maintain an action against Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd for damages for non-delivery, and the measure of damages is the difference between the contract price and the market price, which is £1,000, plus the commission paid to Bernard, totalling £1,100.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 13A:
- Sally commissioned Nicky to landscape her private water garden, and there has been part performance of the contract.
- An order for specific performance could not be made by the court because the cost of putting the waterfall features right would be disproportionate (£20,000) compared to the minor deviation in the height of the waterfall features.
- Therefore, the court may award damages for the breach of the contract. Given that the deviation is minor and only detectable with scientific measuring equipment, the damages awarded are likely to be nominal.

### Conclusion:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 53 applies, and Sally can maintain an action against Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd for damages for non-delivery. The measure of damages is £1,100, which includes the difference between the contract price and the market price, plus the commission paid to Bernard.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 13A applies, and the court may award nominal damages to Sally for the minor breach of contract by Nicky, given the disproportionate cost of rectifying the deviation in the waterfall features.

3. Regarding Peter's breach of contract, Sally can claim damages for the loss of the exclusive run with the glossy magazine, which was valued at around £20,000. The measure of damages would be the loss directly and naturally resulting from Peter's breach, which is the £20,000 she would have earned from the magazine.

### Major Premise:

1. Ho Kwai Chun trading as Multiple Design v Wong King Man

   Conditions:
   - A contract provides for a specific sum to be paid on completion of specific work.
   - The contractor has bona fide completed the project but there are subsequent defects, quite possibly minor.

   Consequences:
   - The contractor is entitled to payment subject to adjustments and reductions for defects.

   Exceptions:
   - The defects are not minor, in which case the employer may not be required to pay the lump sum price.

### Minor Premise:

1. Ho Kwai Chun trading as Multiple Design v Wong King Man:
- Sally has a contract with Nicky to landscape her private water garden at a total cost of £12,000.
- Nicky has bona fide completed the project, but the height of the waterfall features is six inches less than specified.
- The difference in the 'splash and burble effect' can only be detected with scientific measuring equipment, indicating the defect is quite possibly minor.
- The cost of putting the waterfall features right would be £20,000, which is significantly higher than the contract price.

### Conclusion:

The defect in the waterfall features is minor as it can only be detected with scientific measuring equipment and does not significantly affect the overall functionality or aesthetic of the water garden. Therefore, Nicky is entitled to payment subject to adjustments and reductions for the minor defect. Sally may seek a reduction in the contract price to account for the minor defect, but she is not entitled to withhold the entire payment.

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD)

In the case of CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD (precedent p), the Plaintiffs engaged the Defendant to carry out various construction and renovation works at their premises. The Defendant failed to complete the works as agreed, leading to the Plaintiffs terminating the contracts and engaging another contractor to complete the unfinished works and rectify defects. The court ruled that the Plaintiffs were entitled to damages for the diminished value of the works, the costs of rectification by another contractor, and other consequential losses such as pest removal and loss of rental income.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Breach of Contract**: In both cases, the Defendants failed to fulfill their contractual obligations. In CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL, the Defendant failed to complete the renovation works. In our current case, Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd failed to fulfill the order for meerkat garden ornaments, Nicky failed to meet the specified height for the waterfall features, and Peter breached the contract by selling the photographs to a national newspaper.
  
- **Mitigation of Loss**: In both cases, the Plaintiffs took steps to mitigate their losses. In CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL, the Plaintiffs engaged another contractor to complete the works. In our current case, Sally found an alternative supplier for the meerkats and paid Bernard a commission for finding the supplier.
  
- **Consequential Damages**: Both cases involve claims for consequential damages. In CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL, the Plaintiffs claimed for the costs of rectification, pest removal, and loss of rental income. In our current case, Sally may claim for the additional costs incurred due to the breach by Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd, the cost of rectifying the waterfall features, and the loss of potential income from the exclusive rights to the wedding photographs.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see a breach of contract resulting in the need for mitigation of loss and consequential damages, the court should decide in favor of awarding damages to the innocent party. This rule was justified in CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD because the positive effects (E+) of outcome o on the underlying values and principles of the law, such as ensuring that the innocent party is placed in the same position as if the contract had been performed and encouraging parties to fulfill their contractual obligations, outweigh the negative effects (E-) in that case. 

Therefore, applying this rule to our current case, Sally should be awarded damages for the additional costs incurred due to the breach by Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd, the cost of rectifying the waterfall features by Nicky, and the loss of potential income from the exclusive rights to the wedding photographs due to Peter's breach.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD) are present:

- **Breach of Contract**: 
  - **Fact Pattern**: Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd failed to fulfill the order for meerkat garden ornaments. Nicky failed to meet the specified height for the waterfall features. Peter breached the contract by selling the photographs to a national newspaper.
  
- **Mitigation of Loss**: 
  - **Fact Pattern**: Sally found an alternative supplier for the meerkats and paid Bernard a commission for finding the supplier.
  
- **Consequential Damages**: 
  - **Fact Pattern**: Sally incurred additional costs due to the breach by Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd, the cost of rectifying the waterfall features, and the loss of potential income from the exclusive rights to the wedding photographs.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Compensation for the Innocent Party**: Awarding damages to Sally would place her in the same position as if the contracts had been performed, which is a fundamental principle of contract law. This ensures that Sally is not left worse off due to the breaches by Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd, Nicky, and Peter.

2. **Encouraging Fulfillment of Contractual Obligations**: By holding the breaching parties accountable for their failures, the court reinforces the importance of fulfilling contractual obligations. This promotes reliability and trust in commercial transactions.

3. **Mitigation of Loss**: Sally took reasonable steps to mitigate her losses by finding an alternative supplier and paying Bernard a commission. Awarding damages for these additional costs encourages parties to act responsibly and mitigate their losses when faced with a breach.

4. **Compensation for Consequential Damages**: Just as in the precedent case, Sally should be compensated for the consequential damages she suffered, including the cost of rectifying the waterfall features and the loss of potential income from the exclusive rights to the wedding photographs. This ensures that all foreseeable losses resulting from the breaches are addressed.

Therefore, the court should award Sally damages for the additional costs incurred due to the breach by Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd, the cost of rectifying the waterfall features by Nicky, and the loss of potential income from the exclusive rights to the wedding photographs due to Peter's breach. This decision would uphold the principles of contract law and ensure fair compensation for the innocent party.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, **the breach of contract by Peter regarding the exclusive rights to the wedding photographs**, that was not present in **CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of **breach of contract and consequential damages** because it introduces an element of **intellectual property rights and potential loss of commercial opportunity**.

Due to this factor, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as **undermining the enforceability of exclusive rights agreements and potentially encouraging breaches of such agreements for financial gain** than positive ones, unlike in **CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD**. In the precedent case, the damages were primarily related to physical property and construction defects, whereas in our current case, the breach involves a significant commercial opportunity and intellectual property rights, which require a different consideration for damages to ensure that the innocent party is adequately compensated and that the integrity of exclusive rights agreements is upheld.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD** should be stated as "When both [breach of contract resulting in the need for mitigation of loss and consequential damages] and [intellectual property rights and potential loss of commercial opportunity] are present, the court should decide [to award damages to the innocent party]." Omitting [intellectual property rights and potential loss of commercial opportunity] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of undermining the enforceability of exclusive rights agreements and potentially encouraging breaches of such agreements for financial gain]. Indeed, the opinion in **CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD** explicitly states that the court's decision was based on ensuring that the innocent party is placed in the same position as if the contract had been performed, which is crucial when intellectual property rights and commercial opportunities are at stake.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of leaving the innocent party worse off due to the breach of contract and ensuring that they are compensated for all foreseeable losses]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [undermining the enforceability of exclusive rights agreements and potentially encouraging breaches of such agreements for financial gain] if we apply the rule correctly. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be appropriate, as the very purpose it serves is relevant to our situation, ensuring that Sally is adequately compensated for the breaches by Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd, Nicky, and Peter, including the significant commercial opportunity and intellectual property rights involved in Peter's breach.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the specific factor of "construction and renovation works" which was present in the precedent case CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD, requiring this factor for all similar cases of breach of contract and consequential damages would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would limit the applicability of the principles of contract law to only construction-related disputes, thereby excluding other types of breaches that also result in significant consequential damages. Conversely, not requiring the specific factor of "construction and renovation works" would allow for a broader application of the principles of contract law, ensuring that all innocent parties, regardless of the nature of the contract, are adequately compensated for their losses. This better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, which aim to place the innocent party in the same position as if the contract had been performed and to encourage the fulfillment of contractual obligations.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the specific factor of "construction and renovation works," which was present in CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD, we have the additional factor of "intellectual property rights and potential loss of commercial opportunity." This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of breach of contract and consequential damages, serves a similar function to the construction-related breaches in the precedent case. Given the presence of the intellectual property rights and potential loss of commercial opportunity, we submit that the reasoning in CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD still applies. The positive effects on relevant legal values, such as ensuring compensation for the innocent party and upholding the integrity of exclusive rights agreements, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. Therefore, Sally should be awarded damages for the additional costs incurred due to the breach by Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd, the cost of rectifying the waterfall features by Nicky, and the loss of potential income from the exclusive rights to the wedding photographs due to Peter's breach.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to CHAN YEE TAK RACHEL AND ANOTHER v. DSM INTERIOR DESIGN LTD, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the breach of contract, the need for mitigation of loss, and the claim for consequential damages. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly with the involvement of intellectual property rights and potential loss of commercial opportunity in the breach by Peter.

The proposed legal rule of awarding damages to the innocent party for breach of contract, mitigation of loss, and consequential damages finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in the context of intellectual property rights and commercial opportunities.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the precedent supports the awarding of damages for breach of contract and consequential losses, and the counterargument that the involvement of intellectual property rights and commercial opportunities requires a different consideration.

Considering the underlying legal principles of ensuring compensation for the innocent party, upholding the integrity of exclusive rights agreements, and encouraging the fulfillment of contractual obligations, we conclude that Sally should be awarded damages for the breaches committed by Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd, Nicky, and Peter. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency.

Key factors that influenced the outcome include:
1. The need to place Sally in the same position as if the contracts had been performed.
2. The importance of upholding the integrity of exclusive rights agreements.
3. The encouragement of parties to fulfill their contractual obligations.
4. The reasonable steps taken by Sally to mitigate her losses.

Therefore, Sally should be awarded:
- The additional costs incurred due to the breach by Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd.
- The cost of rectifying the waterfall features by Nicky.
- The loss of potential income from the exclusive rights to the wedding photographs due to Peter's breach.

This decision ensures that Sally is adequately compensated for her losses and upholds the principles of contract law.


# Contract Law: The measure of damages Sally can claim from Nicky for the breach of contract regarding the waterfall features

## Deductive Reasoning: cfa

### Relevant law:

Paul Chen v Marianna Chen and Lord Energy Limited

### Major Premise:

1. Paul Chen v Marianna Chen and Lord Energy Limited

   Conditions:
   - Damages have resulted from a breach of contract.
   - The damages may fairly and reasonably be considered as arising naturally from the breach.
   - There were special circumstances under which the contract was made and which had been communicated or made known to the defaulting party.

   Consequences:
   - The measure of damages would be such damages as the parties should reasonably have contemplated would flow from the breach.
   - The damages resulting from the breach are such damages as they should reasonably contemplate would flow from such breach in such special circumstances.

   Exceptions:
   - The damages are considered too remote and are therefore not recoverable.
   - The defaulting party has no knowledge of the special circumstances giving rise to the damages which are being claimed.

### Minor Premise:

1. Damages have resulted from a breach of contract:
   - Nicky breached the contract by not meeting the specified height of the waterfall features.

2. The damages may fairly and reasonably be considered as arising naturally from the breach:
   - The difference in the 'splash and burble effect' is minimal and can only be detected with scientific measuring equipment. Therefore, the damages may not be considered as naturally arising from the breach.

3. There were special circumstances under which the contract was made and which had been communicated or made known to the defaulting party:
   - The specific height of the waterfall features was communicated to Nicky to achieve the maximum 'splash and burble effect'.

### Conclusion:

The measure of damages would be such damages as the parties should reasonably have contemplated would flow from the breach. However, given that the difference in the 'splash and burble effect' is minimal and can only be detected with scientific measuring equipment, the damages may be considered too remote and therefore not recoverable. Additionally, the cost of putting the waterfall features right (£20,000) is disproportionate to the minimal impact of the breach. Therefore, Sally may not be able to claim the full cost of rectification as damages.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (EVER BRIGHT (H.K.) CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING LTD v. KOSASIH MUANTO)

In the case of EVER BRIGHT (H.K.) CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING LTD v. KOSASIH MUANTO [2019] HKCFI 1391; HCA 1037/2013 (precedent p), the plaintiff, Ever Bright, entered into an agreement with the defendant, Kosasih Muanto, for the sale and purchase of a property. The defendant breached the agreement by failing to provide a good title. The court ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to the return of deposits and certain costs but not to damages for loss of bargain because the plaintiff did not have a reasonable chance of obtaining specific performance and there were no exceptional circumstances to justify a departure from the normal rule of assessing damages at the date of breach.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in EVER BRIGHT (H.K.) CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING LTD v. KOSASIH MUANTO and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Breach of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, there was a breach of contract by one party. In EVER BRIGHT, the defendant failed to provide a good title. In Sally's case, Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd failed to fulfil the order, Nicky failed to meet the contractual specification for the waterfall, and Peter breached the contract by selling the photographs.

- **Legal Concept 2: Measure of Damages**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: The measure of damages is a key issue. In EVER BRIGHT, the court assessed damages based on the market value at the date of breach unless exceptional circumstances justified a different date. In Sally's case, the measure of damages for each breach needs to be assessed.

- **Legal Concept 3: Specific Performance and Loss of Bargain**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In EVER BRIGHT, the court considered whether specific performance was a reasonable remedy and whether the plaintiff had a reasonable chance of obtaining it. In Sally's case, the concept of loss of bargain is relevant, particularly in the context of the waterfall features and the exclusive rights to the photographs.

- **Legal Concept 4: Exceptional Circumstances**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In EVER BRIGHT, the court looked for exceptional circumstances to justify a departure from the normal rule of assessing damages at the date of breach. In Sally's case, the exceptional circumstances might include the unique nature of the waterfall features and the exclusive rights to the wedding photographs.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (EVER BRIGHT (H.K.) CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING LTD v. KOSASIH MUANTO)

This suggests a general rule that when we see a breach of contract (fact pattern i*), the court should decide on the measure of damages based on the market value at the date of breach unless there are exceptional circumstances that justify a different date (outcome o). This rule was justified in EVER BRIGHT (H.K.) CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING LTD v. KOSASIH MUANTO because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring fairness and predictability in contractual relations outweighed the negative effects (E-) of potentially not fully compensating the innocent party for their loss in a rising market. 

In Sally's case, applying this rule means that:

- For Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd's breach, Sally can claim the difference between the contract price and the cost of obtaining the meerkats from the new supplier, plus Bernard's commission.
- For Nicky's breach, Sally may not be entitled to the cost of rectifying the waterfall features unless she can demonstrate exceptional circumstances that justify a higher measure of damages.
- For Peter's breach, Sally can claim the loss of the exclusive deal with the glossy magazine, as this represents a clear financial loss directly resulting from the breach.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (EVER BRIGHT (H.K.) CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING LTD v. KOSASIH MUANTO) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Breach of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, there was a breach of contract by one party. In EVER BRIGHT, the defendant failed to provide a good title. In Sally's case, Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd failed to fulfil the order, Nicky failed to meet the contractual specification for the waterfall, and Peter breached the contract by selling the photographs.

- **Legal Concept 2: Measure of Damages**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: The measure of damages is a key issue. In EVER BRIGHT, the court assessed damages based on the market value at the date of breach unless exceptional circumstances justified a different date. In Sally's case, the measure of damages for each breach needs to be assessed.

- **Legal Concept 3: Specific Performance and Loss of Bargain**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In EVER BRIGHT, the court considered whether specific performance was a reasonable remedy and whether the plaintiff had a reasonable chance of obtaining it. In Sally's case, the concept of loss of bargain is relevant, particularly in the context of the waterfall features and the exclusive rights to the photographs.

- **Legal Concept 4: Exceptional Circumstances**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In EVER BRIGHT, the court looked for exceptional circumstances to justify a departure from the normal rule of assessing damages at the date of breach. In Sally's case, the exceptional circumstances might include the unique nature of the waterfall features and the exclusive rights to the wedding photographs.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in EVER BRIGHT (H.K.) CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING LTD v. KOSASIH MUANTO, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Fairness and Predictability**: Applying the rule that damages are assessed at the date of breach unless exceptional circumstances exist ensures fairness and predictability in contractual relations. This principle helps parties understand their potential liabilities and encourages them to adhere to their contractual obligations.

2. **Compensation for Actual Loss**: By assessing damages based on the market value at the date of breach, the court ensures that the innocent party is compensated for their actual loss. This approach prevents overcompensation and aligns with the principle of restitutio in integrum, which aims to restore the injured party to the position they would have been in had the breach not occurred.

3. **Encouragement of Mitigation**: This rule encourages the innocent party to mitigate their losses promptly. In Sally's case, she mitigated her loss by finding an alternative supplier for the meerkats, which aligns with the principle that parties should take reasonable steps to reduce their damages.

4. **Consistency with Precedent**: Following the precedent set in EVER BRIGHT ensures consistency in the application of legal principles. This consistency is crucial for the integrity of the legal system and helps build trust in judicial decisions.

Therefore, applying the rule from EVER BRIGHT (H.K.) CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING LTD v. KOSASIH MUANTO to Sally's case, the court should:

- Award Sally the difference between the contract price and the cost of obtaining the meerkats from the new supplier, plus Bernard's commission.
- Not award the cost of rectifying the waterfall features unless exceptional circumstances are demonstrated.
- Award Sally the loss of the exclusive deal with the glossy magazine due to Peter's breach.

This approach ensures that Sally is fairly compensated for her actual losses while maintaining the principles of fairness, predictability, and consistency in the application of contract law.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the breach of contract by Peter, which was not present in EVER BRIGHT (H.K.) CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING LTD v. KOSASIH MUANTO. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of breach of contract and measure of damages. In Peter's case, the breach involves the unauthorized sale of exclusive wedding photographs, which directly impacts Sally's potential financial gain from an exclusive deal with a glossy magazine.

Due to this factor, applying the same outcome as in EVER BRIGHT would have more negative consequences, such as failing to adequately compensate Sally for the unique and specific loss of a lucrative opportunity. Unlike in EVER BRIGHT, where the damages were assessed based on the market value at the date of breach, the nature of Peter's breach involves a specific and identifiable financial loss that occurred after the breach, making it necessary to consider the actual financial impact on Sally. Therefore, the presence of this factor justifies a different approach to assessing damages in Sally's case.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from EVER BRIGHT (H.K.) CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING LTD v. KOSASIH MUANTO should be stated as: "When both [i*] (breach of contract) and [m] (the breach involves a specific and identifiable financial loss that occurred after the breach) are present, the court should decide [o] (to assess damages based on the actual financial impact on the innocent party rather than strictly at the date of breach)." Omitting [m] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q], which is failing to adequately compensate the innocent party for a unique and specific loss that occurred as a direct result of the breach. Indeed, the opinion in EVER BRIGHT (H.K.) CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING LTD v. KOSASIH MUANTO explicitly states that the absence of exceptional circumstances was crucial to their decision, highlighting the importance of considering specific financial impacts in such cases.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in EVER BRIGHT (H.K.) CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING LTD v. KOSASIH MUANTO was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of overcompensating the innocent party by assessing damages based on a later date when the market value might have risen significantly. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because the breaches by Nicky and Peter involve specific and identifiable financial losses that occurred after the breach. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule strictly here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the court should assess damages based on the actual financial impact on Sally to ensure fair compensation for her unique and specific losses.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of "exceptional circumstances" (m), which was present in the precedent case EVER BRIGHT (H.K.) CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING LTD v. KOSASIH MUANTO, requiring this factor for all similar cases of breach of contract would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would prevent the court from adequately compensating the innocent party for specific and identifiable financial losses that occur as a direct result of the breach. Conversely, not requiring "exceptional circumstances" would allow for a more just and equitable outcome, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, such as compensating the innocent party for their actual loss and encouraging parties to adhere to their contractual obligations.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of "exceptional circumstances" (m), which was present in EVER BRIGHT (H.K.) CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING LTD v. KOSASIH MUANTO, we have the additional factor of "specific and identifiable financial loss" (n). This factor (n), when considered alongside the shared circumstances of breach of contract (i*), serves a similar function to "exceptional circumstances" in the precedent case. Given the presence of "specific and identifiable financial loss" (n), we submit that the reasoning in EVER BRIGHT still applies, as the positive effects on legal values, such as fairness, predictability, and adequate compensation for actual losses, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

In Sally's case, the specific and identifiable financial losses include:

1. The cost difference between the original supplier and the new supplier for the meerkats, plus Bernard's commission.
2. The loss of the exclusive deal with the glossy magazine due to Peter's breach.

These specific and identifiable financial losses justify a departure from the strict rule of assessing damages at the date of breach, ensuring that Sally is fairly compensated for her actual losses.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to EVER BRIGHT (H.K.) CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING LTD v. KOSASIH MUANTO, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the breach of contract and the need to assess damages. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the specific and identifiable financial losses Sally incurred due to Peter's breach and the unique nature of the waterfall features.

The proposed legal rule of assessing damages based on the market value at the date of breach unless exceptional circumstances exist finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in cases involving specific and identifiable financial losses that occur after the breach.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the need for fairness and predictability in contractual relations (as argued in the precedent) and the necessity to adequately compensate the innocent party for their actual losses (as argued in the current case).

Considering the underlying legal principles of compensating the innocent party for their actual loss, encouraging parties to adhere to their contractual obligations, and ensuring fairness and predictability in contractual relations, we conclude that:

1. **For Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd's breach**: Sally should be awarded the difference between the contract price (£2,000) and the cost of obtaining the meerkats from the new supplier (£1,000), plus Bernard's commission (£100). This ensures Sally is compensated for her actual financial loss due to the breach.

2. **For Nicky's breach**: Sally may not be entitled to the cost of rectifying the waterfall features (£20,000) unless she can demonstrate exceptional circumstances that justify a higher measure of damages. Given the minimal impact on the 'splash and burble effect' and the high cost of rectification, it is unlikely that such exceptional circumstances exist.

3. **For Peter's breach**: Sally should be awarded the loss of the exclusive deal with the glossy magazine (£20,000) due to Peter's unauthorized sale of the photographs. This represents a clear financial loss directly resulting from the breach and aligns with the principle of compensating the innocent party for their actual loss.

This approach ensures that Sally is fairly compensated for her actual losses while maintaining the principles of fairness, predictability, and consistency in the application of contract law.


# Contract Law: Whether the cost of rectifying the waterfall features is recoverable as damages from Nicky

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Contract Law principles on damages for breach of contract

### Major Premise:

1. Contract Law principles on damages for breach of contract

   Conditions:
   - A party has entered into a contract.
   - The other party has breached the contract.
   - The innocent party has suffered loss as a result of the breach.
   - The loss is not too remote and was within the contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was made.

   Consequences:
   - The innocent party is entitled to be put in the position they would have been in had the contract been performed.

   Exceptions:
   - The innocent party cannot recover damages for loss that could have been mitigated.
   - The innocent party cannot recover damages for loss that is too remote.

### Minor Premise:

1. Contract Law principles on damages for breach of contract:
- Sally has entered into a contract with Nicky for landscaping her private water garden.
- Nicky has breached the contract by not meeting the specified height of the waterfall features.
- Sally has suffered a loss because the waterfall features do not meet the contractual specification.
- The cost of rectifying the waterfall features to meet the specification is £20,000.
- The loss is not too remote as it was within the contemplation of the parties that the waterfall features would meet the specified height for the desired 'splash and burble effect'.
- However, the difference in 'splash and burble' can only be detected with scientific measuring equipment, indicating that the breach may be considered minor or trivial.
- The cost of rectifying the waterfall features (£20,000) is disproportionate to the benefit gained from the rectification, which may affect the assessment of damages.

### Conclusion:

Sally is entitled to damages for the breach of contract by Nicky. However, given that the difference in 'splash and burble' can only be detected with scientific measuring equipment and the cost of rectification is disproportionate, the court is likely to award damages that reflect the diminution in value or the loss of amenity rather than the full cost of rectification. The exact amount would depend on the court's assessment of the loss suffered by Sally due to the breach.

## Deductive Reasoning: cfi

### Relevant law:

Liu Hong Keung v Liu Ching Leung and HCA 2181/2002 Pamax Limited v Cross Max Interiors Limited

### Major Premise:

1. Liu Hong Keung v Liu Ching Leung

   Conditions:
   - The expenditure for rectifying the breach is out of all proportion to the benefit to be obtained.
   - The loss sustained does not extend to the need to reinstate.
   - The failure to achieve the precise contractual objective does not necessarily result in a total failure.

   Consequences:
   - The appropriate measure of damages is not the cost of reinstatement but the diminution in value of the work occasioned by the breach, even if that would result in a nominal award.

   Exceptions:
   - The loss sustained extends to the need to reinstate.
   - The expenditure is proportionate to the benefit to be obtained.

2. HCA 2181/2002 Pamax Limited v Cross Max Interiors Limited

   Conditions:
   - The work undertaken is necessary to produce conformity with the contract.
   - It is a reasonable course to adopt.

   Consequences:
   - The cost of reinstatement is recoverable as damages.

   Exceptions:
   - The cost of reinstatement is wholly disproportionate to the non-monetary loss suffered by the employer.

### Minor Premise:

1. Liu Hong Keung v Liu Ching Leung:
- The expenditure for rectifying the breach (cost of putting the waterfall features right) is £20,000, which is out of all proportion to the benefit to be obtained (a minor increase in the 'splash and burble effect' detectable only with scientific measuring equipment).
- The loss sustained does not extend to the need to reinstate, as the difference in the 'splash and burble effect' is minimal and not easily noticeable.
- The failure to achieve the precise contractual objective (the exact height of the waterfall) does not necessarily result in a total failure, as the waterfall still functions and the difference is negligible.

   Therefore, the appropriate measure of damages is not the cost of reinstatement but the diminution in value of the work occasioned by the breach, even if that would result in a nominal award.

2. HCA 2181/2002 Pamax Limited v Cross Max Interiors Limited:
- The work undertaken (landscaping the water garden) is necessary to produce conformity with the contract.
- It is a reasonable course to adopt to ensure the specified 'splash and burble effect'.

   However, the cost of reinstatement (£20,000) is wholly disproportionate to the non-monetary loss suffered by Sally (a minor difference in the 'splash and burble effect' detectable only with scientific measuring equipment).

   Therefore, the cost of reinstatement is not recoverable as damages.

### Conclusion:

Liu Hong Keung v Liu Ching Leung applies, and the appropriate measure of damages is the diminution in value of the work occasioned by the breach, which may result in a nominal award. The cost of reinstatement is not recoverable as damages from Nicky.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCCT 44/2011)
In the case of HCCT 44/2011 BETWEEN HO KWAI CHUN trading as MULTIPLE DESIGN Plaintiff and WONG KING MAN Defendant (precedent p), the court dealt with various defects in construction and renovation works. The court ruled that the appropriate measure of damages for defects should be based on the cost of rectification unless such cost is wholly disproportionate to the benefit obtained. In such cases, the court may award damages based on the diminution in value or loss of amenity. For example, the court awarded $380,000 for rebuilding and strengthening the curtain wall, $29,000 for rebuilding the marble steps, and $68,000 for rectifying significant cracks in the son’s bathroom.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCCT 44/2011 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Defective Work**: In HCCT 44/2011, the court identified various construction defects (e.g., curtain wall, marble steps, cracks in the bathroom). In our current case, the waterfall features in Sally's garden are six inches less than specified, which constitutes defective work.
- **Legal Concept 2: Measure of Damages**: In HCCT 44/2011, the court considered whether the cost of rectification was disproportionate to the benefit obtained. Similarly, in our current case, the cost of rectifying the waterfall features is £20,000, which is disproportionate to the minor defect that can only be detected with scientific equipment.
- **Legal Concept 3: Substantial Performance**: In HCCT 44/2011, the court acknowledged that substantial performance of the contract could still warrant payment, subject to deductions for defects. In our current case, Nicky has substantially completed the landscaping work, albeit with a minor defect in the waterfall features.
- **Legal Concept 4: Proportionality of Rectification Costs**: In HCCT 44/2011, the court ruled that rectification costs should be awarded unless they are wholly disproportionate. In our current case, the cost of rectifying the waterfall features (£20,000) is disproportionate to the minor defect.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCCT 44/2011)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern involving defective work (i*), the court should decide that the measure of damages should be based on the cost of rectification unless such cost is wholly disproportionate to the benefit obtained. This rule was justified in HCCT 44/2011 because it balanced the need to compensate the innocent party for defects while avoiding excessive and unreasonable costs that do not correspond to the actual benefit gained from rectification. The positive effects (E+) of this outcome include fair compensation for the innocent party and discouragement of substandard work, while the negative effects (E-) are mitigated by avoiding disproportionate rectification costs.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCCT 44/2011) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Defective Work**: In HCCT 44/2011, the court identified various construction defects (e.g., curtain wall, marble steps, cracks in the bathroom). In our current case, the waterfall features in Sally's garden are six inches less than specified, which constitutes defective work.
- **Legal Concept 2: Measure of Damages**: In HCCT 44/2011, the court considered whether the cost of rectification was disproportionate to the benefit obtained. Similarly, in our current case, the cost of rectifying the waterfall features is £20,000, which is disproportionate to the minor defect that can only be detected with scientific equipment.
- **Legal Concept 3: Substantial Performance**: In HCCT 44/2011, the court acknowledged that substantial performance of the contract could still warrant payment, subject to deductions for defects. In our current case, Nicky has substantially completed the landscaping work, albeit with a minor defect in the waterfall features.
- **Legal Concept 4: Proportionality of Rectification Costs**: In HCCT 44/2011, the court ruled that rectification costs should be awarded unless they are wholly disproportionate. In our current case, the cost of rectifying the waterfall features (£20,000) is disproportionate to the minor defect.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCCT 44/2011. This decision would be justified because, as in HCCT 44/2011, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Fair Compensation**: Awarding damages based on the cost of rectification unless disproportionate ensures that Sally is fairly compensated for the defect in the waterfall features without incurring unreasonable costs.
2. **Encouragement of Quality Work**: This approach discourages contractors from delivering substandard work, knowing that they will be held accountable for defects.
3. **Avoidance of Unreasonable Costs**: By not awarding the disproportionate rectification cost of £20,000 for a minor defect, the court avoids imposing excessive financial burdens on the contractor, which aligns with principles of fairness and reasonableness.

Therefore, the court should award Sally damages based on the diminution in value or loss of amenity rather than the full rectification cost, as the defect is minor and the rectification cost is wholly disproportionate. This approach balances the need for fair compensation with the avoidance of unreasonable financial burdens, consistent with the principles established in HCCT 44/2011.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCCT 44/2011, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of expert reports from both parties' structural engineers. These reports provided a detailed and professional assessment of the defects and the necessary rectifications, which were crucial in determining the appropriate measure of damages. The expert reports ensured that the benefits of the ruling—fair compensation for defects and discouragement of substandard work—outweighed any potential drawbacks, such as imposing unreasonable financial burdens on the contractor.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of expert reports is notably absent. There is no mention of any expert assessment or professional evaluation of the waterfall features' defect or the cost of rectification. This absence means that the court does not have the same level of detailed, professional input to guide its decision on whether the rectification cost is wholly disproportionate to the benefit obtained. Without expert reports, the court may find it challenging to balance the need for fair compensation with the avoidance of unreasonable financial burdens accurately.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in HCCT 44/2011: the specific contractual specification for the height of the waterfall features to achieve the maximum 'splash and burble effect.' This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of defective work. In HCCT 44/2011, the defects were more general and did not involve such a specific, measurable performance criterion.

Because of this specific contractual specification, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences than positive ones. The negative consequences include potentially undermining the importance of adhering to precise contractual terms, which could lead to a lack of accountability for contractors in meeting specific performance criteria. Unlike in HCCT 44/2011, where the defects were more general and the rectification costs were assessed with the help of expert reports, the specific performance criterion in our case makes the defect more significant, even if it is minor and detectable only with scientific equipment. Therefore, the court may need to consider this specific contractual term more heavily in its decision, potentially leading to a different outcome.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCCT 44/2011 should be stated as "When both [i*] (defective work) and [m] (expert reports) are present, the court should decide [o] (award damages based on the cost of rectification unless such cost is wholly disproportionate to the benefit obtained)." Omitting [m] (expert reports) from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q] (inaccurate assessment of whether rectification costs are disproportionate, leading to unfair compensation or excessive financial burdens). Indeed, the opinion in HCCT 44/2011 explicitly states that the expert reports were crucial to their decision, as they provided detailed, professional assessments that guided the court in determining the appropriate measure of damages.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCCT 44/2011 was clearly designed to prevent [undesirable consequence u] (unfair compensation or excessive financial burdens due to inaccurate assessment of rectification costs). However, in our current case, there's no risk of [u] occurring because the specific contractual specification for the height of the waterfall features provides a clear, measurable performance criterion. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The specific contractual term makes the defect more significant, even if minor, and should be considered more heavily in the court's decision.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the expert reports, which were present in the precedent case HCCT 44/2011, requiring this factor for all similar cases of defective work would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would impose an unnecessary burden on parties to always procure expert reports, even in cases where the defect and its impact are clear and undisputed. Conversely, not requiring expert reports would allow for a more streamlined and efficient resolution of disputes, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, such as fairness, efficiency, and the avoidance of unnecessary costs.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks expert reports, which were present in HCCT 44/2011, we have the additional factor of a specific contractual specification for the height of the waterfall features. This specific contractual term, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of defective work, serves a similar function to the expert reports in the precedent case. Given the presence of this specific contractual term, we submit that the reasoning in HCCT 44/2011 still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as ensuring adherence to contractual terms and fair compensation, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCCT 44/2011, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of defective work and the need to assess the appropriate measure of damages. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of expert reports in the current case and the presence of a specific contractual specification for the height of the waterfall features.

The proposed legal rule from HCCT 44/2011, which suggests that damages should be based on the cost of rectification unless such cost is wholly disproportionate to the benefit obtained, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the specific contractual terms in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of expert reports in accurately assessing rectification costs (as highlighted in the precedent) and the significance of adhering to specific contractual terms (as emphasized in the current case). Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, efficiency, and the avoidance of unnecessary costs, as well as the need to ensure adherence to contractual terms, we conclude that the court should award Sally damages based on the diminution in value or loss of amenity rather than the full rectification cost.

This decision is justified because the defect in the waterfall features is minor and detectable only with scientific equipment, making the rectification cost of £20,000 wholly disproportionate. Additionally, the specific contractual term regarding the height of the waterfall features should be considered, but it does not outweigh the principle of avoiding disproportionate rectification costs.

Therefore, the court should award Sally damages that reflect the minor nature of the defect and the specific contractual term, ensuring fair compensation without imposing unreasonable financial burdens on the contractor. This approach aligns with the principles established in HCCT 44/2011 while also serving justice and legal consistency in the current case.

   - Sally, the buyer, is compelled to treat this breach as a breach of warranty.
   - Sally is not entitled to reject the goods by reason only of such breach of warranty.
   - Sally may set up against Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd the breach of warranty in diminution or extinction of the price, or maintain an action for damages.

2. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 55 Subsections 2 and 3:
   - There is a breach of warranty of quality as Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd failed to deliver the goods.
   - The measure of damages is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting from the breach.
   - The loss is prima facie the difference between the value of the goods at the time of delivery and the value they would have had if they had answered to the warranty.
   - Sally had to pay £1,000 to the new supplier and £100 in commission to Bernard, totalling £1,100.
   - The difference in value is £2,000 (original cost) - £1,100 (new cost) = £900.

3. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 55 Subsection 4:
   - Sally has set up the breach of warranty in diminution or extinction of the price.

### Conclusion:

Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 55 Subsections 1, 2, 3, and 4 apply. Sally is entitled to claim damages from Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd for the breach of warranty. The measure of damages is the difference between the original cost (£2,000) and the new cost (£1,100), amounting to £900. Sally can maintain an action for this amount.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (CACV 7/2005)
In the case of CACV 7/2005 between Falcon Construction Engineering Limited (Plaintiff) and Kirin Civil Engineering Contractors Limited (Defendant) (precedent p), the court ruled that the damages claimed by the defendant for delay were too remote and not within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time of contracting. The court upheld the principle from Hadley v Baxendale, which states that damages must be a foreseeable consequence of the breach of contract. The court dismissed the appeal and awarded costs to the plaintiff.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in CACV 7/2005 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Remoteness of Damages**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In CACV 7/2005, the court found that the damages claimed for delay were too remote because the plaintiff could not have reasonably foreseen the specific circumstances leading to the delay. Similarly, in Sally's case, the cost of putting the waterfall features right (£20,000) may be considered too remote if the difference in the 'splash and burble effect' is only detectable with scientific equipment and not reasonably foreseeable as a significant issue at the time of contracting.

- **Legal Concept 2: Foreseeability of Loss**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In CACV 7/2005, the court emphasized that the damages must be within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time of contracting. In Sally's case, the loss of the exclusive deal with the glossy magazine due to Peter selling the photographs to a national newspaper for £10,000 was a foreseeable consequence of the breach, as the contract explicitly stated that all rights to the photographs remained with Sally.

- **Legal Concept 3: Mitigation of Loss**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In CACV 7/2005, the court noted that there was no evidence that the deviation in the piling works could not have been detected earlier, implying a duty to mitigate loss. In Sally's case, she mitigated her loss by finding an alternative supplier for the meerkats at a lower cost through Bernard, thus reducing her potential damages.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (CACV 7/2005)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of damages being too remote and not within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time of contracting, the court should decide that such damages are not recoverable. This rule was justified in CACV 7/2005 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that only foreseeable and reasonable damages are awarded promote fairness and predictability in contractual relationships, outweighing the negative effects (E-) of potentially leaving some losses uncompensated.

Applying this rule to Sally's case:

- **Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd**: Sally mitigated her loss by finding an alternative supplier at a lower cost. The damages she can claim would be limited to the difference in cost and any additional expenses incurred, such as Bernard's commission. The rule from CACV 7/2005 supports that only foreseeable and reasonable damages are recoverable.

- **Nicky**: The cost of rectifying the waterfall features (£20,000) may be considered too remote if the difference in the 'splash and burble effect' is only detectable with scientific equipment and not reasonably foreseeable. The rule from CACV 7/2005 would likely lead to the conclusion that such damages are not recoverable.

- **Peter**: The loss of the exclusive deal with the glossy magazine (£20,000) was a foreseeable consequence of Peter's breach of contract. The rule from CACV 7/2005 supports that Sally should be awarded damages for this foreseeable loss.

Therefore, Sally can claim reasonable and foreseeable damages for the breaches by Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd and Peter, but the claim for rectifying the waterfall features by Nicky may be considered too remote.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (CACV 7/2005) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Remoteness of Damages**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In CACV 7/2005, the court found that the damages claimed for delay were too remote because the plaintiff could not have reasonably foreseen the specific circumstances leading to the delay. Similarly, in Sally's case, the cost of putting the waterfall features right (£20,000) may be considered too remote if the difference in the 'splash and burble effect' is only detectable with scientific equipment and not reasonably foreseeable as a significant issue at the time of contracting.

- **Legal Concept 2: Foreseeability of Loss**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In CACV 7/2005, the court emphasized that the damages must be within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time of contracting. In Sally's case, the loss of the exclusive deal with the glossy magazine due to Peter selling the photographs to a national newspaper for £10,000 was a foreseeable consequence of the breach, as the contract explicitly stated that all rights to the photographs remained with Sally.

- **Legal Concept 3: Mitigation of Loss**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In CACV 7/2005, the court noted that there was no evidence that the deviation in the piling works could not have been detected earlier, implying a duty to mitigate loss. In Sally's case, she mitigated her loss by finding an alternative supplier for the meerkats at a lower cost through Bernard, thus reducing her potential damages.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in CACV 7/2005. This decision would be justified because, as in CACV 7/2005, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Promoting Fairness and Predictability**: By ensuring that only foreseeable and reasonable damages are awarded, the court promotes fairness and predictability in contractual relationships. Parties can better assess their risks and obligations at the time of contracting, leading to more stable and reliable business practices.

2. **Encouraging Mitigation of Loss**: By recognizing Sally's efforts to mitigate her loss by finding an alternative supplier, the court encourages parties to take reasonable steps to minimize their damages, which is beneficial for the overall efficiency of the market.

3. **Upholding Contractual Terms**: By awarding damages for the foreseeable loss of the exclusive deal with the glossy magazine, the court upholds the importance of contractual terms and the expectations of the parties, thereby reinforcing the sanctity of contracts.

Therefore, Sally can claim reasonable and foreseeable damages for the breaches by Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd and Peter, but the claim for rectifying the waterfall features by Nicky may be considered too remote. This approach aligns with the principles established in CACV 7/2005 and ensures a balanced and just outcome.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, **the explicit contractual term regarding the rights to the photographs**, that was not present in CACV 7/2005. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of **foreseeability of loss**. In Sally's case, the contract explicitly stated that all rights to the photographs remained with her, making the breach by Peter and the subsequent loss of the exclusive deal with the glossy magazine a direct and foreseeable consequence of the breach. Due to this explicit contractual term, applying the same outcome as in CACV 7/2005 would have more negative consequences, such as undermining the enforceability of clear contractual terms and the expectations of the parties, than positive ones. Unlike in CACV 7/2005, where the foreseeability of the loss was not clear, the presence of this explicit term in Sally's case makes the loss foreseeable and directly attributable to the breach, justifying a different outcome.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from CACV 7/2005 should be stated as: "When both the fact pattern of damages being too remote and not within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time of contracting, and the presence of an explicit contractual term regarding the rights to the subject matter are present, the court should decide that such damages are recoverable." Omitting the explicit contractual term from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of undermining the enforceability of clear contractual terms and the expectations of the parties. Indeed, the opinion in CACV 7/2005 explicitly states that the foreseeability of the loss was crucial to their decision, and the presence of an explicit term in Sally's case makes the loss foreseeable and directly attributable to the breach.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in CACV 7/2005 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of awarding damages that are too remote and not within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time of contracting. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because the presence of an explicit contractual term regarding the rights to the photographs makes the loss foreseeable and directly attributable to the breach. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the explicit factor of "deviation detection timing" (factor m), which was present in the precedent case CACV 7/2005, requiring this factor for all similar cases of "foreseeability of loss" (fact pattern i*) would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would undermine the enforceability of clear contractual terms and the expectations of the parties. Conversely, not requiring the "deviation detection timing" factor would allow for a more straightforward application of the principle that damages must be within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time of contracting. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which emphasize the importance of foreseeability and the sanctity of contractual terms.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the "deviation detection timing" factor (m), which was present in CACV 7/2005, we have the additional factor of "explicit contractual terms regarding rights to the subject matter" (n). This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of "foreseeability of loss" (i*), serves a similar function to the "deviation detection timing" in the precedent case. Given the presence of the explicit contractual terms, we submit that the reasoning in CACV 7/2005 still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as predictability, fairness, and the enforceability of contracts would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to CACV 7/2005, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in the application of the principles of remoteness of damages and foreseeability of loss. However, it also differs in significant ways, such as the explicit contractual term regarding the rights to the photographs in Sally's case, which was not present in CACV 7/2005.

The proposed legal rule from CACV 7/2005, which emphasizes that damages must be a foreseeable consequence of the breach of contract and within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time of contracting, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the explicit contractual terms in Sally's case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the explicit contractual term regarding the rights to the photographs makes the loss foreseeable and directly attributable to the breach (a strong point for Sally), and the argument that the cost of rectifying the waterfall features may be considered too remote if the difference in the 'splash and burble effect' is only detectable with scientific equipment (a strong point against Sally's claim for rectifying the waterfall).

Considering the underlying legal principles of foreseeability, remoteness of damages, and the enforceability of contractual terms, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that:

1. **Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd**: Sally mitigated her loss by finding an alternative supplier at a lower cost. The damages she can claim would be limited to the difference in cost and any additional expenses incurred, such as Bernard's commission. This aligns with the principle of mitigation of loss and the rule from CACV 7/2005.

2. **Nicky**: The cost of rectifying the waterfall features (£20,000) is too remote if the difference in the 'splash and burble effect' is only detectable with scientific equipment and not reasonably foreseeable. This aligns with the principle of remoteness of damages as established in CACV 7/2005.

3. **Peter**: The loss of the exclusive deal with the glossy magazine (£20,000) was a foreseeable consequence of Peter's breach of contract, given the explicit contractual term regarding the rights to the photographs. Therefore, Sally should be awarded damages for this foreseeable loss. This aligns with the principle of foreseeability of loss and the enforceability of contractual terms.

In conclusion, Sally can claim reasonable and foreseeable damages for the breaches by Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd and Peter, but the claim for rectifying the waterfall features by Nicky is considered too remote. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency. The key factors influencing this outcome are the principles of foreseeability, remoteness of damages, and the explicit contractual terms in Sally's case.

   - The special circumstances under which the contract was made were wholly unknown to the party breaking the contract

2. Richly Bright International Ltd v De Monsa Investments Ltd

   Conditions:
   - The loss is within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach of it; and
   - The loss is not too remote to be recoverable

   Consequences:
   - The damages for breach of contract should be such as may fairly and reasonably be considered either arising naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of things, from such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach of it

   Exceptions:
   - The special circumstances were wholly unknown to the party breaking the contract, in which case he could only be supposed to have had in his contemplation the amount of injury which would arise generally, and in the great multitude of cases not affected by any special circumstances, from such a breach of contract

### Minor Premise:

1. Hadley v Baxendale:
- Sally had a contract with Peter for the exclusive rights to the wedding photographs.
- Peter breached the contract by selling the photographs to a national newspaper.
- The damages claimed by Sally (the lost opportunity to sell the photographs to the glossy magazine for £20,000) may fairly and reasonably be considered arising naturally from the breach of contract itself, as the exclusivity was a key term.
- The special circumstances (the potential sale to the glossy magazine) were likely known to Peter, as the exclusivity clause implies a significant commercial interest in the photographs.

2. Richly Bright International Ltd v De Monsa Investments Ltd:
- The loss (the £20,000 from the glossy magazine) is within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach of it, given the exclusivity clause.
- The loss is not too remote to be recoverable because the exclusivity clause directly relates to the commercial value of the photographs.
- The special circumstances (the potential sale to the glossy magazine) were not wholly unknown to Peter, as the exclusivity clause suggests that Sally had commercial plans for the photographs.

### Conclusion:

Both Hadley v Baxendale and Richly Bright International Ltd v De Monsa Investments Ltd apply. Sally can claim the lost opportunity to sell the photographs to the glossy magazine as damages from Peter.

2. Richly Bright International Ltd v De Monsa Investments Ltd:
- The loss of the £20,000 from the glossy magazine was within the reasonable contemplation of both Sally and Peter at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach.
- The loss is not too remote to be recoverable, as it directly stems from Peter's breach of the exclusivity clause in the contract.
- The special circumstances (the potential sale to the glossy magazine) were not wholly unknown to Peter, as the contract specified that all rights to the photographs remain with Sally.

### Conclusion:

Both Hadley v Baxendale and Richly Bright International Ltd v De Monsa Investments Ltd apply, and Sally is entitled to receive damages of £20,000 from Peter for the breach of contract.
