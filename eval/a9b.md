   - The court or arbitrator is of opinion that it would be equitable to do so, having regard to:
     * The nature of the misrepresentation
     * The loss that would be caused by it if the contract were upheld
     * The loss that rescission would cause to the other party

   Consequences:
   - The court or arbitrator may declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission

   Exceptions:
   - None

4. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 4

### Minor Premise:

1. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 2:
- Cissy has entered into a contract with Peter after a misrepresentation has been made to her.
- The misrepresentation has become a term of the contract (e.g., the ice-making machines and lorries being reliable).
- The contract has been performed (Cissy has paid part of the purchase price).
- Cissy would be entitled to rescind the contract without alleging fraud.
- Therefore, Cissy is entitled to rescind the contract, notwithstanding that the misrepresentation has become a term of the contract or the contract has been performed.

2. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1:
- Cissy has entered into a contract with Peter after a misrepresentation.
- The misrepresentation was made to her by Peter.
- Cissy has suffered loss as a result of the misrepresentation (e.g., the lorry's destruction and the ice-making machines' malfunction).
- If Peter had made the misrepresentation fraudulently, Peter would be liable to damages.
- However, Peter may argue that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the facts represented were true and did believe up to the time the contract was made that the facts represented were true.
- Therefore, this section may not apply if Peter can prove his belief was reasonable.

3. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2:
- Cissy has entered into a contract.
- She entered into the contract after a misrepresentation has been made to her.
- The misrepresentation was not made to her fraudulently.
- Cissy would be entitled, by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract.
- It is claimed in any proceedings arising out of the contract that the contract ought to be or has been rescinded.
- The court or arbitrator is of opinion that it would be equitable to do so, having regard to:
  * The nature of the misrepresentation (innocent but material).
  * The loss that would be caused by it if the contract were upheld (significant financial loss).
  * The loss that rescission would cause to the other party (Peter would lose the sale).
- Therefore, the court or arbitrator may declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission.

4. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 4:
- The contract contains a term which would exclude or restrict any liability to which Peter may be subject by reason of any misrepresentation made by him before the contract was made.
- Any remedy available to Cissy by reason of such a misrepresentation.
- That term shall be of no effect unless it satisfies the requirement of reasonableness as stated in section 3(1) of the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 71).
- It is for Peter to show that the term satisfies that requirement.

### Conclusion:

Cissy has several legal options under the Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284. She may be entitled to rescind the contract under Section 2. If Peter can prove he had reasonable grounds to believe his statements were true, he may avoid liability for damages under Section 3 Subsection 1. However, under Section 3 Subsection 2, the court may declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission, considering the equitable factors. Additionally, any term in the contract excluding Peter's liability for misrepresentation would be of no effect unless it satisfies the requirement of reasonableness.

## Deductive Reasoning: cfa

### Relevant law:

Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v Robert John Francis Brothers

### Major Premise:

1. Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v Robert John Francis Brothers

   Conditions:
   - A statement is made that is literally true but gives a misleading impression; or
   - A statement is made that is later falsified by new facts coming into existence before the representation has been relied upon; and
   - The representor fails to correct the misleading impression or the falsified statement

   Consequences:
   - The representor may be liable for misrepresentation

   Exceptions:
   - There is no duty of disclosure, such as in non-insurance contracts; or
   - The misleading impression or falsified statement was not pleaded or adequately put to the witness in cross-examination

### Minor Premise:

1. Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v Robert John Francis Brothers:

   - Peter made statements about the ice-making machines and the lorries.
   - The statement about the ice-making machines being recently upgraded and requiring a tune-up every six months was literally true but gave a misleading impression because the machines were misconfigured and later broke down.
   - The statement about the lorries being "seasoned and trusty" and "110% reliable" was misleading because they had not been serviced since 2015, and one lorry later malfunctioned and was destroyed.
   - Peter failed to correct the misleading impression about the ice-making machines and the lorries.
   - The misleading impression or falsified statement was not pleaded or adequately put to the witness in cross-examination is not applicable here as we are considering the initial contract formation and not a trial scenario.

### Conclusion:

Peter's statements about the ice-making machines and lorries constitute misrepresentation under the principles established in Aktieselskabet Dansk Skibsfinansiering v Robert John Francis Brothers. Cissy may have legal grounds to claim misrepresentation and seek remedies such as rescission of the contract or damages.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (CACV000205/2000)
In the case of CACV000205/2000 between Green Park Properties Limited (plaintiff) and Dorku Limited (defendant) (precedent p), the court ruled that there was a misrepresentation by the vendor that the yard was part of the property to be sold to the purchaser. The court found that the misrepresentation was made both by showing the property to the purchaser and by showing the tenancy plan to the purchaser. The court held that the misrepresentation was actionable and justified the termination of the agreement.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in CACV000205/2000 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Misrepresentation by Conduct**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (p)**: The vendor showed the property and the tenancy plan, which gave the impression that the yard was part of the property.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (c)**: Peter showed Cissy the factory and the lorries, giving the impression that the ice-making machines were recently upgraded and the lorries were reliable.

- **Legal Concept 2: Material Misrepresentation**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (p)**: The misrepresentation about the yard was material as it affected the purchaser's decision to enter into the contract.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (c)**: The misrepresentations about the ice-making machines and the lorries were material as they affected Cissy's decision to acquire Island Ice.

- **Legal Concept 3: Inducement to Enter Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (p)**: The misrepresentation induced the purchaser to enter into the agreement.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (c)**: The misrepresentations induced Cissy to enter into the acquisition agreement.

- **Legal Concept 4: Right to Rescind the Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (p)**: The purchaser was entitled to rescind the contract due to the misrepresentation.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (c)**: Cissy may be entitled to rescind the contract due to the misrepresentations about the ice-making machines and the lorries.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (CACV000205/2000)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern involving misrepresentation by conduct, material misrepresentation, inducement to enter the contract, and the right to rescind the contract, the court should decide that the misrepresentation is actionable and the representee is entitled to rescind the contract. This rule was justified in CACV000205/2000 because the positive effects (E+) of allowing the representee to rescind the contract due to misrepresentation uphold the principles of fairness and honesty in contractual dealings, outweighing the negative effects (E-) of potentially disrupting contractual stability. 

In the current case, applying this rule would mean that Cissy has the legal option to rescind the contract for the acquisition of Island Ice due to the actionable misrepresentations made by Peter regarding the ice-making machines and the lorries.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (CACV000205/2000) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Misrepresentation by Conduct**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: Peter showed Cissy the factory and the lorries, giving the impression that the ice-making machines were recently upgraded and the lorries were reliable.

- **Legal Concept 2: Material Misrepresentation**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: The misrepresentations about the ice-making machines and the lorries were material as they affected Cissy's decision to acquire Island Ice.

- **Legal Concept 3: Inducement to Enter Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: The misrepresentations induced Cissy to enter into the acquisition agreement.

- **Legal Concept 4: Right to Rescind the Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: Cissy may be entitled to rescind the contract due to the misrepresentations about the ice-making machines and the lorries.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome: that the misrepresentation is actionable and Cissy is entitled to rescind the contract. This decision would be justified because, as in CACV000205/2000, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Fairness and Honesty in Contractual Dealings**: Allowing Cissy to rescind the contract due to the misrepresentations would reinforce the principle that parties must be honest and transparent in their representations when entering into contracts. This promotes trust and integrity in commercial transactions.

2. **Protecting the Innocent Party**: Cissy, as the innocent party who relied on the misrepresentations, should be protected from entering into a contract based on false information. This ensures that parties are not unfairly disadvantaged by the deceit or negligence of the other party.

3. **Deterrence of Misrepresentation**: By ruling in favor of rescission, the court would send a clear message that misrepresentation, whether intentional or negligent, will not be tolerated. This serves as a deterrent to others who might consider making false statements to induce contracts.

4. **Equitable Relief**: Given the significant impact of the misrepresentations on Cissy's decision to purchase Island Ice, rescission is an equitable remedy that restores the parties to their original positions, thereby preventing unjust enrichment of the misrepresenting party.

Therefore, the court should allow Cissy to rescind the contract for the acquisition of Island Ice due to the actionable misrepresentations made by Peter regarding the ice-making machines and the lorries. This outcome aligns with the principles upheld in CACV000205/2000 and ensures fairness and justice in contractual relationships.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business, that was not present in CACV000205/2000. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of misrepresentation and inducement to enter the contract. Because of the pandemic, the financial stability and future profitability of Island Ice were severely compromised, which Peter failed to disclose to Cissy. This omission is crucial because it directly affects the viability of the business and Cissy's decision to purchase it.

Due to the pandemic's impact, applying the same outcome of allowing rescission in our case would have more negative consequences, such as the potential financial ruin of Cissy's catering business, than positive ones. Unlike in CACV000205/2000, where the misrepresentation was about a physical aspect of the property, the misrepresentation in our case involves the overall financial health and future prospects of the business, which are significantly more critical to the purchaser's decision-making process. Therefore, the presence of this factor necessitates a different consideration and potentially a different outcome.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from CACV000205/2000 should be stated as: "When both [misrepresentation by conduct, material misrepresentation, inducement to enter the contract, and the right to rescind the contract] and [significant impact of external factors such as a pandemic on the business] are present, the court should decide [that the misrepresentation is actionable and the representee is entitled to rescind the contract]." Omitting [the significant impact of external factors such as a pandemic on the business] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of parties being unfairly bound to contracts that are no longer viable due to unforeseen and significant external changes]. Indeed, the opinion in CACV000205/2000 implicitly emphasizes the importance of the misrepresentation's materiality and its impact on the decision to enter the contract, which would be exacerbated by significant external factors.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in CACV000205/2000 was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties being misled into contracts based on false representations]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [the parties being misled without considering the significant impact of the pandemic on the business]. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The significant impact of the pandemic on Island Ice's business operations and financial health is a crucial factor that must be considered to ensure fairness and justice in the contractual relationship.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the specific factor of a physical misrepresentation about the property boundary, which was present in the precedent case CACV000205/2000, requiring this factor for all similar cases of misrepresentation would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would limit the scope of actionable misrepresentations to only those involving physical property boundaries, thereby excluding other significant misrepresentations that can equally affect a party's decision to enter into a contract. Conversely, not requiring this specific factor would allow for a broader and more equitable application of the law, ensuring that all material misrepresentations, whether they pertain to physical boundaries or other critical aspects of a business, are actionable. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which aim to uphold fairness, honesty, and the protection of parties from entering into agreements based on false information.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the specific factor of a physical misrepresentation about the property boundary, which was present in CACV000205/2000, we have the additional factor of the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business's financial health and future prospects. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of misrepresentation by conduct, material misrepresentation, inducement to enter the contract, and the right to rescind the contract, serves a similar function to the physical misrepresentation in the precedent case. Given the presence of this additional factor, we submit that the reasoning in CACV000205/2000 still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as upholding fairness and honesty in contractual dealings and protecting the innocent party, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to CACV000205/2000, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as misrepresentation by conduct, material misrepresentation, inducement to enter the contract, and the right to rescind the contract. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business's financial health and future prospects.

The proposed legal rule of allowing rescission due to actionable misrepresentation finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of upholding fairness and honesty in contractual dealings and protecting the innocent party (Cissy) from entering into a contract based on false information, against the potential disruption of contractual stability and the unique impact of the pandemic on the business.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, honesty, and the protection of parties from misrepresentation, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Cissy should be entitled to rescind the contract for the acquisition of Island Ice due to the actionable misrepresentations made by Peter regarding the ice-making machines and the lorries. This decision aligns with the principles upheld in CACV000205/2000 and ensures justice and legal consistency by addressing the significant impact of the pandemic on the business, which was a crucial factor in Cissy's decision to purchase Island Ice.

Therefore, the court should allow Cissy to rescind the contract, as this outcome upholds the principles of fairness and honesty in contractual dealings, protects the innocent party, and ensures that parties are not unfairly bound to contracts that are no longer viable due to unforeseen and significant external changes.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA 1410/2009)
In the case of HCA 1410/2009 BETWEEN TUNG NGAR AIR-CONDITION & STEEL Plaintiff HOLDINGS LIMITED and SHING HIN CATERING GROUP LIMITED Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to payment of the 5th instalment of the contract price despite the presence of some defects in the work. The court found that the plaintiff had achieved practical or substantial completion of the works, and thus, the payment was due. The court also noted that any ambiguity in the contract should be resolved against the party that drafted it, applying the contra proferentem rule.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA 1410/2009 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Practical or Substantial Completion**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (p):** The plaintiff had completed the majority of the work, and the remaining defects were not fundamental to the operation of the food factory.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (c):** The ice-making machines and lorries were part of the assets to be transferred, and their operational status is crucial to the business.

- **Legal Concept 2: Contra Proferentem Rule**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (p):** The contract was drafted by the defendant, and any ambiguity was resolved against them.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (c):** Peter provided the information and representations about the business, which could be construed as part of the contract terms.

- **Legal Concept 3: Misrepresentation**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (p):** The court considered whether the defects were within the scope of the contract and whether they were fundamental.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (c):** Peter's statements about the reliability of the lorries and the recent upgrade of the ice-making machines could be seen as misrepresentations if they were not accurate.

- **Legal Concept 4: Breach of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (p):** The plaintiff was entitled to payment despite some defects, as they had substantially completed the work.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (c):** The malfunction of the ice-making machines and the destruction of the lorry could be seen as a breach of the implied terms of the contract regarding the condition of the assets.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA 1410/2009)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of practical or substantial completion, the court should decide that the party is entitled to payment or performance under the contract, subject to set-off or counterclaim for any defects. This rule was justified in HCA 1410/2009 because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring that parties are paid for substantial performance and that minor defects do not unduly delay payment outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially allowing some defects to remain unaddressed.

Applying this rule to the current case, Cissy could argue that despite the issues with the ice-making machines and the lorry, the business was substantially as represented by Peter. However, she could also claim damages for any misrepresentations or breaches of contract related to the condition of the assets. The contra proferentem rule would support resolving any ambiguities in the contract terms against Peter, who provided the information and representations.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA 1410/2009) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Practical or Substantial Completion**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (p):** The plaintiff had completed the majority of the work, and the remaining defects were not fundamental to the operation of the food factory.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (c):** The ice-making machines and lorries were part of the assets to be transferred, and their operational status is crucial to the business.

- **Legal Concept 2: Contra Proferentem Rule**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (p):** The contract was drafted by the defendant, and any ambiguity was resolved against them.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (c):** Peter provided the information and representations about the business, which could be construed as part of the contract terms.

- **Legal Concept 3: Misrepresentation**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (p):** The court considered whether the defects were within the scope of the contract and whether they were fundamental.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (c):** Peter's statements about the reliability of the lorries and the recent upgrade of the ice-making machines could be seen as misrepresentations if they were not accurate.

- **Legal Concept 4: Breach of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (p):** The plaintiff was entitled to payment despite some defects, as they had substantially completed the work.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (c):** The malfunction of the ice-making machines and the destruction of the lorry could be seen as a breach of the implied terms of the contract regarding the condition of the assets.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach a similar outcome as in HCA 1410/2009. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Fairness and Equity**: By applying the principle of practical or substantial completion, the court would ensure that Cissy is not unduly penalized for minor defects or issues that do not fundamentally affect the operation of the business. This aligns with the principle of fairness and equity in contractual relationships.

2. **Encouraging Honest Dealings**: Applying the contra proferentem rule would discourage parties from providing ambiguous or misleading information in contracts. This would promote transparency and honesty in business transactions, which is crucial for maintaining trust in commercial dealings.

3. **Providing Remedies for Misrepresentation**: Recognizing the potential misrepresentations made by Peter regarding the condition of the lorries and the ice-making machines would allow Cissy to seek appropriate remedies. This would ensure that parties are held accountable for the accuracy of their statements and representations, thereby protecting the interests of the buyer.

4. **Balancing Interests**: Allowing Cissy to claim damages for the malfunctioning ice-making machines and the destroyed lorry would balance the interests of both parties. While Peter would still receive payment for the business, Cissy would be compensated for the losses incurred due to the misrepresentations and breaches of contract.

In conclusion, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns as the precedent case, we submit that the court should reach a similar outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA 1410/2009, it would ensure fairness, encourage honest dealings, provide remedies for misrepresentation, and balance the interests of both parties.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA 1410/2009, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the concept of "practical or substantial completion." This concept was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as ensuring that parties are paid for substantial performance and that minor defects do not unduly delay payment, outweighed any potential drawbacks, such as allowing some defects to remain unaddressed. However, in our current case, this crucial concept of "practical or substantial completion" is notably absent as the ice-making machines and one of the lorries are not merely defective but are completely non-functional. This goes beyond minor defects and affects the core functionality of the business, making it impossible to argue that there has been practical or substantial completion.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor of "misrepresentation" that was not present in HCA 1410/2009. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because Peter's statements about the reliability of the lorries and the recent upgrade of the ice-making machines could be seen as misrepresentations if they were not accurate. Due to this misrepresentation, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as allowing a party to benefit from providing false or misleading information, than positive ones, unlike in HCA 1410/2009. This is because the misrepresentations directly influenced Cissy's decision to purchase the business, and the non-functional state of the assets significantly impacts the value and operational capability of the business.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from HCA 1410/2009 should be stated as: "When both practical or substantial completion and misrepresentation are present, the court should decide that the party is entitled to payment or performance under the contract, subject to set-off or counterclaim for any defects, and also provide remedies for misrepresentation." Omitting the factor of misrepresentation from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence of allowing a party to benefit from providing false or misleading information, which would undermine the integrity of contractual relationships and commercial transactions. Indeed, the opinion in HCA 1410/2009 implicitly emphasizes the importance of ensuring that parties are held accountable for the accuracy of their statements and representations, as seen in the court's detailed examination of the defects and the scope of the contract.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in HCA 1410/2009 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of parties being unduly penalized for minor defects that do not fundamentally affect the operation of the business. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence occurring because the issues with the ice-making machines and the lorry are not minor defects but rather fundamental problems that significantly impact the business's operational capability. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—ensuring fairness in the presence of minor defects—is not relevant to our situation where the defects are substantial and coupled with misrepresentation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of "practical or substantial completion," which was present in the precedent case HCA 1410/2009, requiring this factor for all similar cases of misrepresentation and breach of contract would lead to the undesirable consequence of allowing sellers to escape liability for significant misrepresentations and fundamental breaches. Conversely, not requiring "practical or substantial completion" would allow for a more equitable outcome, ensuring that buyers are protected from substantial misrepresentations and fundamental breaches that significantly impact the value and operational capability of the business. This better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, which aim to ensure fairness and accountability in commercial transactions.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of "practical or substantial completion," which was present in HCA 1410/2009, we have the additional factor of "misrepresentation." This "misrepresentation," when considered alongside the shared circumstances of the malfunctioning ice-making machines and the destroyed lorry, serves a similar function to "practical or substantial completion" in the precedent case. Given the presence of "misrepresentation," we submit that the reasoning in HCA 1410/2009 still applies, as the positive effects on ensuring fairness, encouraging honest dealings, and providing remedies for misrepresentation would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA 1410/2009, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the importance of the operational status of the assets and the presence of misrepresentations. However, it also differs significantly in that the issues with the ice-making machines and the lorry are not minor defects but fundamental problems that significantly impact the business's operational capability.

The proposed legal rule of "When both practical or substantial completion and misrepresentation are present, the court should decide that the party is entitled to payment or performance under the contract, subject to set-off or counterclaim for any defects, and also provide remedies for misrepresentation" finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the importance of ensuring fairness and equity in contractual relationships and the need to hold parties accountable for misrepresentations.

Considering the underlying legal principles of contract law, which aim to ensure fairness, accountability, and the integrity of commercial transactions, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Cissy has valid legal options to pursue remedies for misrepresentation and breach of contract. The malfunctioning ice-making machines and the destroyed lorry are fundamental issues that go beyond minor defects, and the misrepresentations made by Peter significantly influenced Cissy's decision to purchase the business.

Therefore, Cissy should be entitled to seek damages for the losses incurred due to the misrepresentations and breaches of contract. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by ensuring that parties are held accountable for the accuracy of their statements and representations in commercial transactions.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (TOP FAITH PROPERTY LTD v. WONG BEN AND OTHERS)

In the case of TOP FAITH PROPERTY LTD v. WONG BEN AND OTHERS [2022] HKCA 783; CACV 438/2021 (precedent p), the plaintiff sought to rescind a provisional sale and purchase agreement due to a misrepresentation regarding the saleable area of a property. The court ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to rescind the agreement and recover the initial deposit because the representation about the saleable area was false and had induced the plaintiff to enter into the agreement (outcome o).

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in TOP FAITH PROPERTY LTD v. WONG BEN AND OTHERS and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Misrepresentation**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In the precedent case, the defendants made a false representation about the saleable area of the property. In the current case, Peter made representations about the reliability of the lorries and the profitability of the business, which were false or misleading.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Inducement**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In the precedent case, the false representation induced the plaintiff to enter into the provisional agreement. In the current case, the representations about the lorries and the business's profitability induced Cissy to enter into the acquisition agreement.
  
- **Legal Concept 3: Right to Rescind**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In the precedent case, the plaintiff was entitled to rescind the agreement due to the misrepresentation. In the current case, Cissy may seek to rescind the acquisition agreement due to the misrepresentations about the lorries and the business's profitability.
  
- **Legal Concept 4: Recovery of Losses**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In the precedent case, the plaintiff was entitled to recover the initial deposit. In the current case, Cissy may seek to recover the initial instalment paid and any other losses incurred due to the misrepresentations.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (TOP FAITH PROPERTY LTD v. WONG BEN AND OTHERS)

This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern involving a false representation that induces a party to enter into an agreement, the court should decide that the misled party is entitled to rescind the agreement and recover any losses incurred. This rule was justified in TOP FAITH PROPERTY LTD v. WONG BEN AND OTHERS because the positive effects (E+) of allowing the misled party to rescind the agreement and recover losses uphold the principles of fairness and integrity in contractual dealings, outweighing any negative effects (E-) such as the inconvenience to the representor. 

In the current case, applying this rule would mean that Cissy is entitled to rescind the acquisition agreement for Island Ice and recover the initial instalment and any other losses incurred due to the misrepresentations about the lorries and the business's profitability.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (TOP FAITH PROPERTY LTD v. WONG BEN AND OTHERS) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Misrepresentation**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In the precedent case, the defendants made a false representation about the saleable area of the property. In the current case, Peter made representations about the reliability of the lorries and the profitability of the business, which were false or misleading. Specifically, Peter's statements that the lorries were "seasoned and trusty" and "110% reliable" were misleading given that one lorry had not been serviced since 2015 and subsequently burst into flames. Additionally, Peter's omission regarding the impact of the pandemic on the business's profitability constitutes a misrepresentation by omission.

- **Legal Concept 2: Inducement**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In the precedent case, the false representation induced the plaintiff to enter into the provisional agreement. In the current case, the representations about the lorries and the business's profitability induced Cissy to enter into the acquisition agreement. Cissy relied on Peter's statements and the audited accounts, which did not reflect the current financial difficulties due to the pandemic.

- **Legal Concept 3: Right to Rescind**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In the precedent case, the plaintiff was entitled to rescind the agreement due to the misrepresentation. In the current case, Cissy may seek to rescind the acquisition agreement due to the misrepresentations about the lorries and the business's profitability. The misrepresentations were material and induced Cissy to enter into the contract, thus giving her the right to rescind.

- **Legal Concept 4: Recovery of Losses**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In the precedent case, the plaintiff was entitled to recover the initial deposit. In the current case, Cissy may seek to recover the initial instalment paid and any other losses incurred due to the misrepresentations. This includes the $2 million initial payment and any consequential losses from the misrepresentations.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in TOP FAITH PROPERTY LTD v. WONG BEN AND OTHERS, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Fairness and Integrity in Contractual Dealings**: Allowing Cissy to rescind the contract and recover her losses would uphold the principles of fairness and integrity in contractual dealings. It ensures that parties are not misled into agreements based on false or misleading representations.

2. **Deterrence of Misrepresentation**: This outcome would deter parties from making false or misleading statements during negotiations, promoting honesty and transparency in business transactions.

3. **Protection of the Innocent Party**: It protects the innocent party (Cissy) who relied on the representations made by Peter. This aligns with the legal principle that a party should not suffer due to the misrepresentations of another.

4. **Consistency in Legal Precedents**: Applying the same rule ensures consistency in legal precedents, providing predictability and stability in the law.

Therefore, given the shared fact patterns and the positive effects on the underlying values and principles of the law, the court should allow Cissy to rescind the acquisition agreement and recover her losses.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, **the impact of the pandemic on the business's profitability**, that was not present in **TOP FAITH PROPERTY LTD v. WONG BEN AND OTHERS**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of misrepresentation and inducement because the pandemic's impact on the business's profitability introduces an element of **unforeseeable external circumstances** that were not within the control of either party.

Due to the pandemic's impact, applying the same outcome of rescission and recovery of losses in our case would have more negative consequences such as **unfairly penalizing Peter for circumstances beyond his control** and **potentially setting a precedent where sellers are held liable for unforeseeable global events**. Unlike in **TOP FAITH PROPERTY LTD v. WONG BEN AND OTHERS**, where the misrepresentation was directly related to the property and within the control of the defendants, the pandemic's impact on Island Ice's profitability is an external factor that complicates the straightforward application of misrepresentation principles.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from **TOP FAITH PROPERTY LTD v. WONG BEN AND OTHERS** should be stated as: "When both [misrepresentation inducing a party to enter into an agreement] and [the misrepresentation being within the control of the representor] are present, the court should decide [to allow the misled party to rescind the agreement and recover losses]." Omitting [the misrepresentation being within the control of the representor] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of unfairly penalizing parties for circumstances beyond their control, such as global events like the pandemic]. Indeed, the opinion in **TOP FAITH PROPERTY LTD v. WONG BEN AND OTHERS** implicitly states that the misrepresentation was crucial to their decision because it was directly related to the property and within the control of the defendants.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in **TOP FAITH PROPERTY LTD v. WONG BEN AND OTHERS** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties being misled into agreements based on false or misleading representations that are within the control of the representor]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [unfairly penalizing Peter for the impact of the pandemic, which is an external and unforeseeable event beyond his control]. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The misrepresentation about the lorries and the profitability of the business, while material, is complicated by the pandemic's impact, which was not within Peter's control. Thus, the court should consider this external factor and potentially adjust the remedies accordingly, rather than strictly applying the rule from the precedent case.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction

While it's true that our case lacks the factor of the misrepresentation being within the control of the representor, which was present in the precedent case **TOP FAITH PROPERTY LTD v. WONG BEN AND OTHERS**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of misrepresentation and inducement would lead to the undesirable consequence of allowing parties to escape liability for misrepresentations simply because some external factors were also at play. Conversely, not requiring the misrepresentation to be within the control of the representor would allow for a more comprehensive protection of the innocent party, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and integrity in contractual dealings. This approach ensures that parties are held accountable for the representations they make, regardless of external circumstances, thereby promoting honesty and transparency in business transactions.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution

Although our case lacks the factor of the misrepresentation being within the control of the representor, which was present in **TOP FAITH PROPERTY LTD v. WONG BEN AND OTHERS**, we have the additional factor of the pandemic's impact on the business's profitability. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of misrepresentation and inducement, serves a similar function to the control factor in the precedent case. Given the presence of the pandemic's impact, we submit that the reasoning in **TOP FAITH PROPERTY LTD v. WONG BEN AND OTHERS** still applies, as the positive effects on the relevant legal values—such as upholding fairness and integrity in contractual dealings, deterring misrepresentation, and protecting the innocent party—would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. The pandemic's impact highlights the importance of full disclosure and accurate representation, reinforcing the need for remedies like rescission and recovery of losses to maintain trust and fairness in contractual relationships.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **TOP FAITH PROPERTY LTD v. WONG BEN AND OTHERS**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, particularly in terms of misrepresentation and inducement. Both cases involve false representations that induced the plaintiff to enter into an agreement, and both plaintiffs sought to rescind the agreement and recover losses.

However, the current case differs significantly due to the impact of the pandemic on the business's profitability, which introduces an element of unforeseeable external circumstances beyond the control of the representor (Peter). This factor complicates the straightforward application of the misrepresentation principles seen in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case is that when a misrepresentation induces a party to enter into an agreement, the misled party is entitled to rescind the agreement and recover losses. This rule finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the pandemic's impact.

We've weighed arguments from both sides. A strong point from the initial analogy is that allowing Cissy to rescind the contract and recover her losses would uphold fairness and integrity in contractual dealings, deterring misrepresentation and protecting the innocent party. On the other hand, a strong point from the rebuttal is that applying the same rule without considering the pandemic's impact could unfairly penalize Peter for circumstances beyond his control, potentially setting a precedent where sellers are held liable for unforeseeable global events.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, integrity in contractual dealings, and the need to deter misrepresentation while also acknowledging the impact of external factors like the pandemic, we conclude that Cissy should be entitled to rescind the acquisition agreement and recover her losses. However, the court should also consider the pandemic's impact when determining the extent of Peter's liability and the appropriate remedies.

Therefore, Cissy is entitled to rescind the acquisition agreement due to the misrepresentations about the lorries and the business's profitability. She should recover the initial instalment paid and any other losses incurred due to the misrepresentations. However, the court should take into account the pandemic's impact when assessing any additional claims for damages or losses, ensuring a balanced and fair outcome that aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency.

### Conclusion:

Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2 applies, and the court would declare the contract subsisting and award Cissy damages in lieu of rescission. Cissy's decision not to inspect the lorries does not affect her ability to claim misrepresentation, as the misrepresentations made by Peter were material and she relied on them in entering the contract.

   Conditions:
   - There is a misrepresentation by conduct or statement made by the vendor.
   - The misrepresentation is likely to induce the contract.
   - The representee entered the contract based on the misrepresentation.

   Consequences:
   - The representee is entitled to rescind the contract.

   Exceptions:

   - The representee did not rely on the misrepresentation.
   - It is equitable to declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission under section 3(2) of the Misrepresentation Ordinance.

### Minor Premise:

1. Green Park Properties Limited v Dorku Limited:
   - There is a misrepresentation by conduct or statement made by Peter:
     * Peter stated that the ice-making machines had been recently upgraded and would require a tune-up every six months, which was untrue due to the misconfiguration.
     * Peter described the lorries as “seasoned and trusty” and “110% reliable,” which was misleading given their last service was in 2015.
     * Peter showed Cissy the audited accounts for the financial year ending 31 March 2020, omitting the impact of the pandemic on current profits.
   - The misrepresentation is likely to induce the contract:
     * Cissy was influenced by the statements about the machines, lorries, and financial health of the company.
   - Cissy entered the contract based on the misrepresentation:
     * Cissy signed the contract on 12 January 2021 after being shown the factory, lorries, and financial accounts.

   Exceptions:
   - The misrepresentation is not of relatively minor importance:
     * The misconfiguration of the ice-making machines and the unreliability of the lorries are significant issues.
   - Cissy did rely on the misrepresentation:
     * Cissy declined to inspect the lorries, relying on Peter’s statements.
   - It may not be equitable to declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission:
     * The misrepresentations are material and have a significant impact on the value and operation of the business.

### Conclusion:

Cissy is entitled to rescind the contract based on the misrepresentations made by Peter. The misrepresentations were material and likely induced Cissy to enter the contract. Cissy relied on these misrepresentations, and it would not be equitable to declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission. Therefore, Cissy can seek rescission of the contract.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG Plaintiff and MING YIU HENG Defendant)
In the case of HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG Plaintiff and MING YIU HENG Defendant (precedent p), the plaintiff claimed the outstanding balance of the purchase price for shares sold under an equity transfer agreement and sought to void a settlement agreement on the grounds of duress. The defendant counterclaimed for rescission of the equity transfer agreement due to misrepresentation. The court ruled that the defendant was entitled to rescind the equity transfer agreement due to the plaintiff's misrepresentations, despite the defendant having the opportunity to discover the falsity of the representations.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA 1584/2010 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Misrepresentation**: In HCA 1584/2010, the plaintiff made false representations about the value and future investment in the company. In our current case, Peter made false representations about the reliability of the lorries and the profitability of the business.
- **Reliance on Representations**: In HCA 1584/2010, the defendant relied on the false representations to enter into the equity transfer agreement. Similarly, in our current case, Cissy relied on Peter's representations about the lorries and the business's profitability to enter into the acquisition agreement.
- **Opportunity to Discover Falsity**: In HCA 1584/2010, the defendant had the opportunity to discover the falsity of the representations but did not. In our current case, Cissy had the opportunity to inspect the lorries but chose not to.
- **Rescission as a Remedy**: In HCA 1584/2010, the court allowed rescission of the contract due to misrepresentation. In our current case, Cissy may seek rescission of the acquisition agreement due to Peter's misrepresentations.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA 1584/2010)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of misrepresentation and reliance on those misrepresentations, the court should decide in favor of rescission of the contract. This rule was justified in HCA 1584/2010 because the positive effects (E+) of allowing rescission for misrepresentation uphold the principles of fairness and integrity in contractual dealings, outweighing the negative effects (E-) of potentially allowing parties to avoid contracts due to their own lack of due diligence. 

In conclusion, Cissy can argue that she is entitled to rescind the acquisition agreement due to Peter's misrepresentations about the reliability of the lorries and the profitability of the business, despite her decision not to inspect the lorries. The precedent set in HCA 1584/2010 supports her position that the opportunity to discover the falsity of the representations does not bar her from seeking rescission.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG Plaintiff and MING YIU HENG Defendant) are present:

- **Misrepresentation**: In HCA 1584/2010, the plaintiff made false representations about the value and future investment in the company. In our current case, Peter made false representations about the reliability of the lorries and the profitability of the business.
- **Reliance on Representations**: In HCA 1584/2010, the defendant relied on the false representations to enter into the equity transfer agreement. Similarly, in our current case, Cissy relied on Peter's representations about the lorries and the business's profitability to enter into the acquisition agreement.
- **Opportunity to Discover Falsity**: In HCA 1584/2010, the defendant had the opportunity to discover the falsity of the representations but did not. In our current case, Cissy had the opportunity to inspect the lorries but chose not to.
- **Rescission as a Remedy**: In HCA 1584/2010, the court allowed rescission of the contract due to misrepresentation. In our current case, Cissy may seek rescission of the acquisition agreement due to Peter's misrepresentations.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome of allowing rescission of the contract. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA 1584/2010, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Fairness and Integrity**: Allowing rescission in cases of misrepresentation ensures that parties cannot benefit from their false statements, thereby upholding the principles of fairness and integrity in contractual dealings.
2. **Deterrence of Misrepresentation**: By permitting rescission, the court sends a strong message that misrepresentation will not be tolerated, thereby deterring parties from making false statements in future transactions.
3. **Protection of Innocent Parties**: Rescission protects innocent parties who have been misled into entering contracts based on false information, ensuring they are not unfairly bound by such agreements.
4. **Consistency in Legal Principles**: Applying the same rule as in HCA 1584/2010 ensures consistency in the application of legal principles, providing predictability and stability in the law.

Therefore, Cissy can argue that she is entitled to rescind the acquisition agreement due to Peter's misrepresentations about the reliability of the lorries and the profitability of the business, despite her decision not to inspect the lorries. The precedent set in HCA 1584/2010 supports her position that the opportunity to discover the falsity of the representations does not bar her from seeking rescission.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG Plaintiff and MING YIU HENG Defendant, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the misrepresentations made by the plaintiff were unequivocally false and were not subject to any reasonable interpretation as being true. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—upholding fairness and integrity in contractual dealings—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it was clear that the defendant had been misled by the plaintiff's false statements.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as the misrepresentations made by Peter about the lorries being "seasoned and trusty" and "110% reliable" could be interpreted as statements of opinion rather than unequivocal falsehoods. This distinction is important because statements of opinion are generally not actionable as misrepresentations unless it can be shown that the opinion was not genuinely held or was made recklessly. Therefore, the absence of unequivocal falsehoods in the current case weakens the argument for rescission based on misrepresentation.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG Plaintiff and MING YIU HENG Defendant. This factor is the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the profitability of Island Ice, which was not disclosed by Peter. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of misrepresentation and reliance because the pandemic's impact on the business's profitability is a material fact that would have likely influenced Cissy's decision to enter into the acquisition agreement.

Due to the presence of the pandemic's impact, applying the same outcome of allowing rescission in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the stability and predictability of contractual agreements during extraordinary circumstances like a global pandemic. Unlike in HCA 1584/2010, where the misrepresentations were clear and unequivocal, the current case involves a complex interplay of factors, including the unforeseen impact of the pandemic, which complicates the assessment of misrepresentation and its materiality. Therefore, the presence of this factor suggests that a different legal outcome may be more appropriate to balance the interests of both parties and maintain contractual stability during extraordinary times.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG Plaintiff and MING YIU HENG Defendant should be stated as: "When both [misrepresentation and reliance on those misrepresentations] and [the opportunity to discover the falsity of the representations] are present, the court should decide [in favor of rescission of the contract]." Omitting [the opportunity to discover the falsity of the representations] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of allowing parties to avoid contracts due to their own lack of due diligence]. Indeed, the opinion in HCA 1584/2010 explicitly states that the opportunity to discover the falsity of the representations was not a bar to rescission, emphasizing that the misrepresentations themselves were unequivocally false and materially induced the contract.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA 1584/2010 was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties being bound by contracts induced by unequivocally false representations]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [this specific undesirable consequence] occurring because the misrepresentations made by Peter about the lorries being "seasoned and trusty" and "110% reliable" could be interpreted as statements of opinion rather than unequivocal falsehoods. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The current case involves a complex interplay of factors, including the unforeseen impact of the pandemic, which complicates the assessment of misrepresentation and its materiality. Thus, the rule from HCA 1584/2010 should not apply to the current case.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the unequivocal falsehoods present in the precedent case HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG Plaintiff and MING YIU HENG Defendant, requiring this factor for all similar cases of misrepresentation and reliance on those misrepresentations would lead to the undesirable consequence of allowing parties to escape liability for misleading statements simply because they were framed as opinions rather than facts. Conversely, not requiring unequivocal falsehoods would allow for a more comprehensive protection of parties who have been misled, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, such as fairness, integrity, and the prevention of unjust enrichment.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the unequivocal falsehoods, which were present in HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG Plaintiff and MING YIU HENG Defendant, we have the additional factor of the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the profitability of Island Ice, which was not disclosed by Peter. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of misrepresentation and reliance on those misrepresentations, serves a similar function to the unequivocal falsehoods in the precedent case. Given the presence of the pandemic's impact, we submit that the reasoning in HCA 1584/2010 still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as fairness, integrity, and the protection of innocent parties would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG Plaintiff and MING YIU HENG Defendant, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of misrepresentation and reliance on those misrepresentations. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the nature of the misrepresentations (statements of opinion versus unequivocal falsehoods) and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business's profitability.

The proposed legal rule that "when both misrepresentation and reliance on those misrepresentations are present, the court should decide in favor of rescission of the contract" finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the distinctions between statements of opinion and unequivocal falsehoods, and the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that allowing rescission upholds fairness and integrity in contractual dealings (as argued in favor of applying the precedent) and the counterpoint that the misrepresentations in the current case may be interpreted as opinions rather than unequivocal falsehoods (as argued against applying the precedent).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, integrity, and the protection of innocent parties, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Cissy is entitled to seek rescission of the acquisition agreement due to Peter's misrepresentations. Despite the nature of the misrepresentations being potentially interpreted as opinions, the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business's profitability, which was not disclosed, materially affects the fairness of the contract. This aligns with the precedent set in HCA 1584/2010, where the opportunity to discover the falsity of the representations did not bar rescission.

Therefore, Cissy can argue that she is entitled to rescind the acquisition agreement due to Peter's misrepresentations about the reliability of the lorries and the profitability of the business, despite her decision not to inspect the lorries. The precedent set in HCA 1584/2010 supports her position that the opportunity to discover the falsity of the representations does not bar her from seeking rescission. This decision serves justice and legal consistency by upholding the principles of fairness and integrity in contractual dealings.

### Major Premise:

1. FACV000026A/1998

   Conditions:
   - A party makes a statement that is literally true but gives a misleading impression; or
   - The facts which falsify the representation come into existence later, but before the representation has been relied upon; and
   - The representor fails to correct the misleading impression

   Consequences:
   - The representor is under a duty to correct what was said and not allow the other party to rely upon a statement which has become false

   Exceptions:

2. Green Park Properties Limited v Dorku Limited

   Conditions:
   - A representation is made by one party to another party during the course of negotiations; and
   - The representation is false or misleading; and
   - The other party relies on the representation to enter into the contract; and
   - The representation is material to the decision to enter into the contract

   Consequences:
   - The party misled by the representation may be entitled to rescind the contract and claim damages

   Exceptions:
   - The contract contains a term that excludes or restricts liability for misrepresentation and
   - The term satisfies the requirement of reasonableness as stated in section 3(1) of the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, Cap.71

### Minor Premise:

- Peter made statements about the ice-making machines and the lorries that were literally true but gave a misleading impression.
- The facts which falsify the representation (misconfigured gears and outdated servicing of lorries) came into existence before the representation was relied upon.
- Peter failed to correct the misleading impression about the reliability of the lorries and the recent upgrade of the ice-making machines.
- There is no indication that this is a contract of insurance, so the exception does not apply.

2. Green Park Properties Limited v Dorku Limited:
- Peter made representations to Cissy during the course of negotiations.
- The representations about the ice-making machines and the lorries were false or misleading.

Peter's omission about the financial impact of the pandemic and the misleading statements about the ice-making machines and lorries constitute misrepresentation. Cissy may be entitled to rescind the contract and claim damages.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA 505/2012 BETWEEN LI CHO KWAN Plaintiff and OLIVEIRO LANA 1st Defendant HONG KONG BUSINESS Agency Limited 2nd Defendant)
In the case of HCA 505/2012 BETWEEN LI CHO KWAN Plaintiff and OLIVEIRO LANA 1st Defendant HONG KONG BUSINESS Agency Limited 2nd Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the misrepresentations made by the agent (HKBA) on behalf of the vendor (Oliveiro) were actionable. The court found that HKBA was acting as an agent for Oliveiro and that the representations made in the Business Profile were false and induced the plaintiff (Li) to enter into the Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA). The court allowed Li to rescind the SPA and the Supplementary SPA due to the fraudulent misrepresentations.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA 505/2012 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Misrepresentation**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA 505/2012, the vendor (Oliveiro) through her agent (HKBA) made false representations about the business (Maternia) which induced the plaintiff (Li) to enter into the SPA. In the current case, Peter made representations about the profitability and reliability of Island Ice, which induced Cissy to enter into the acquisition agreement.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: Agency**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA 505/2012, HKBA acted as an agent for Oliveiro in making the representations. In the current case, although there is no third-party agent, Peter himself made the representations directly to Cissy.

- **Legal Concept 3: Inducement**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA 505/2012, Li was induced to enter into the SPA based on the false representations. In the current case, Cissy was induced to enter into the acquisition agreement based on Peter's representations about the business's profitability and the condition of the assets.

- **Legal Concept 4: Rescission**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCA 505/2012, the court allowed Li to rescind the SPA due to the fraudulent misrepresentations. In the current case, Cissy may seek to rescind the acquisition agreement due to the misrepresentations made by Peter.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA 505/2012)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of misrepresentation (i*), the court should decide that the misrepresentation is actionable and allow for rescission of the contract (outcome o). This rule was justified in HCA 505/2012 because the positive effects (E+) of outcome o on the underlying values and principles of the law, such as fairness and the protection of parties from fraudulent inducement, outweigh the negative effects (E-) in that case. 

In the current case, applying this rule would mean that Cissy has the legal option to rescind the acquisition agreement due to Peter's misrepresentations about the profitability of Island Ice and the condition of its assets. This is justified because it upholds the principle that parties should not be induced into contracts based on false information, thereby promoting fairness and integrity in commercial transactions.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA 505/2012) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Misrepresentation**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA 505/2012, the vendor (Oliveiro) through her agent (HKBA) made false representations about the business (Maternia) which induced the plaintiff (Li) to enter into the SPA. In the current case, Peter made representations about the profitability and reliability of Island Ice, which induced Cissy to enter into the acquisition agreement.

- **Legal Concept 2: Agency**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA 505/2012, HKBA acted as an agent for Oliveiro in making the representations. In the current case, although there is no third-party agent, Peter himself made the representations directly to Cissy.

- **Legal Concept 3: Inducement**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA 505/2012, Li was induced to enter into the SPA based on the false representations. In the current case, Cissy was induced to enter into the acquisition agreement based on Peter's representations about the business's profitability and the condition of the assets.

- **Legal Concept 4: Rescission**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In HCA 505/2012, the court allowed Li to rescind the SPA due to the fraudulent misrepresentations. In the current case, Cissy may seek to rescind the acquisition agreement due to the misrepresentations made by Peter.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome of allowing rescission of the contract. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA 505/2012, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding Fairness**: Allowing rescission would ensure that Cissy is not bound by a contract that she entered into based on false information. This promotes fairness in commercial transactions.

2. **Deterrence of Fraudulent Behavior**: By holding Peter accountable for his misrepresentations, the court would deter similar behavior in the future, thereby promoting integrity in business dealings.

3. **Protection of Parties**: The decision would protect parties from being misled into contracts that are not in their best interest, thereby upholding the principle that contracts should be based on true and accurate information.

4. **Consistency in Legal Principles**: Applying the same legal principles consistently across similar cases ensures predictability and stability in the legal system, which is crucial for the rule of law.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome of allowing rescission of the contract. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA 505/2012, it would have the positive effects of upholding fairness, deterring fraudulent behavior, protecting parties, and ensuring consistency in legal principles.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA 505/2012, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the presence of an agent (HKBA) who made the misrepresentations on behalf of the vendor (Oliveiro). The agency relationship was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as upholding fairness and deterring fraudulent behavior, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it established a clear line of responsibility for the misrepresentations. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of an intermediary agent is notably absent as Peter himself made the representations directly to Cissy without any third-party involvement.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor of the pandemic's impact on the business, which was not present in HCA 505/2012. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of misrepresentation because the pandemic's impact on Island Ice's profitability is an external, unforeseeable event that affects the business's financial health. Due to the pandemic, applying the same outcome of allowing rescission in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the principle of caveat emptor (buyer beware) and potentially leading to an increase in rescission claims based on external economic factors, unlike in HCA 505/2012 where the misrepresentations were directly attributable to the vendor or their agent.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA 505/2012 should be stated as 'When both [misrepresentation] and [agency relationship] are present, the court should decide [to allow rescission of the contract].' Omitting [agency relationship] from this rule could lead to [undesirable consequence q], which is the potential for an increase in rescission claims based on misrepresentations made directly by the vendor without any intermediary, thereby undermining the principle of caveat emptor (buyer beware). Indeed, the opinion in HCA 505/2012 explicitly states that the agency relationship was crucial to their decision, as it established a clear line of responsibility for the misrepresentations.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA 505/2012 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of parties being misled into contracts based on false information provided by an intermediary agent, thereby ensuring fairness and integrity in commercial transactions. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence occurring because the misrepresentations were made directly by Peter to Cissy without any intermediary. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—to address misrepresentations made through an agent—is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of an intermediary agent (m), which was present in the precedent case HCA 505/2012, requiring this factor for all similar cases of misrepresentation would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would create a loophole where vendors could avoid liability for misrepresentations simply by making them directly rather than through an agent. Conversely, not requiring the presence of an intermediary agent would allow for a more comprehensive protection of parties from fraudulent inducement, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and integrity in commercial transactions. This approach ensures that all parties are held accountable for their representations, regardless of whether they are made directly or through an agent.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of an intermediary agent (m), which was present in HCA 505/2012, we have the additional factor of the pandemic's impact on the business (n). This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of misrepresentation (i*), serves a similar function to the intermediary agent in the precedent case by highlighting the external and unforeseeable nature of the misrepresentations. Given the presence of the pandemic's impact, we submit that the reasoning in HCA 505/2012 still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as fairness, protection of parties, and deterrence of fraudulent behavior would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. The pandemic's impact underscores the importance of accurate and complete information in commercial transactions, further justifying the need for rescission in cases of misrepresentation.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA 505/2012 BETWEEN LI CHO KWAN Plaintiff and OLIVEIRO LANA 1st Defendant HONG KONG BUSINESS Agency Limited 2nd Defendant, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of misrepresentation and the inducement of the plaintiff to enter into a contract based on false information. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of an intermediary agent and the impact of the pandemic on the business's financial health.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case, which allows for rescission of the contract in instances of misrepresentation, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the unique circumstances of the current case, such as the direct misrepresentations made by Peter and the external impact of the pandemic.

We've weighed arguments from both sides. A strong point from the initial analogy is that misrepresentation, whether made directly or through an agent, should be actionable to uphold fairness and integrity in commercial transactions. On the other hand, a strong point from the rebuttal is that the absence of an intermediary agent and the external impact of the pandemic introduce complexities that were not present in the precedent case, potentially leading to different legal considerations.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, protection of parties, and deterrence of fraudulent behavior, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Cissy should be entitled to rescind the acquisition agreement due to Peter's misrepresentations. This decision aligns with the precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by ensuring that parties are not bound by contracts entered into based on false information, regardless of whether the misrepresentations were made directly or through an agent.

Key factors that influenced this outcome include the need to uphold fairness in commercial transactions, the importance of accurate and complete information, and the principle that parties should not be misled into contracts based on false representations. Therefore, Cissy has the legal option to rescind the acquisition agreement and seek remedies for any losses incurred due to the misrepresentations made by Peter.

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 9:
- There is a contract for the sale of specific goods (the lorry and ice-making machines).
- The lorry, without any fault on the part of Peter or Cissy, perished before the risk passed to Cissy (the lorry was destroyed on 22 March, before the transfer of possession on 1 April).

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2:
- The contract for the acquisition of Island Ice has become impossible of performance or been otherwise frustrated (the ice-making machines malfunctioned and will take six months to repair, making it impossible to produce ice and causing significant revenue loss).
- The parties (Peter and Cissy) have for that reason been discharged from the further performance of the contract.

3. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 8:
- There is a contract for the sale of specific goods (the ice-making machines).
- The ice-making machines, without the knowledge of Peter, had perished at the time when the contract was made (the misconfiguration of the gears was unknown to both parties).

4. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3:
- The contract for the acquisition of Island Ice has become impossible of performance or been otherwise frustrated.
- The parties (Peter and Cissy) have for that reason been discharged from the further performance of the contract.
- Peter has obtained a valuable benefit (the initial instalment of $2 million) before the time of discharge.

### Conclusion:

The destruction of the lorry on 22 March constitutes a frustration of contract under the Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 9 and the Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2. The contract is thereby avoided, and Cissy is entitled to recover the initial instalment of $2 million paid to Peter. Additionally, under the Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3, Peter may be required to return the initial instalment, subject to any expenses he incurred for the performance of the contract.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD)
In the case of SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD (precedent p), the court ruled that the tenant's defences of rental reduction and frustration due to COVID-19 were not credible. The court held that the tenant's obligation to pay rent was not frustrated by the pandemic, as the lease's nature and object were not fundamentally altered, and the tenant's business difficulties did not meet the high threshold for frustration. The court also found that the landlord was not wholly unreasonable in holding onto the lease despite the tenant's repudiation.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Frustration of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In SUNBROAD, the tenant argued that the lease was frustrated due to the impact of COVID-19 on their business. In our current case, Cissy might argue that the destruction of the lorry and the malfunction of the ice-making machines frustrate the contract.
  
- **Legal Concept 2: High Threshold for Frustration**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In SUNBROAD, the court emphasized that frustration requires a significant change in the nature of contractual obligations, which was not met by the tenant's business difficulties. Similarly, in our current case, the destruction of the lorry and the malfunction of the machines must be assessed to see if they meet this high threshold.
  
- **Legal Concept 3: Obligation to Perform**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In SUNBROAD, the tenant was still obligated to pay rent despite the pandemic. In our current case, Cissy's obligation to complete the acquisition and pay the remaining instalment must be considered in light of the recent events.
  
- **Legal Concept 4: Reasonableness of Holding onto the Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In SUNBROAD, the landlord was not unreasonable in holding onto the lease despite the tenant's repudiation. In our current case, whether Cissy can argue that it is unreasonable for her to proceed with the acquisition given the recent events must be evaluated.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD)
This suggests a general rule that when we see a significant change in the nature of contractual obligations that does not meet the high threshold for frustration, the court should decide that the contract is not frustrated, and the parties remain obligated to perform their contractual duties. This rule was justified in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD because the positive effects (E+) of maintaining contractual obligations and upholding the stability and predictability of commercial agreements outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potential business difficulties faced by one party.

In applying this rule to our current case, Cissy's argument that the destruction of the lorry and the malfunction of the ice-making machines frustrate the contract is unlikely to succeed unless she can demonstrate that these events fundamentally and radically change the nature of the contractual obligations beyond what was reasonably contemplated at the time of the agreement. Given the high threshold for frustration and the court's emphasis on maintaining contractual obligations, it is likely that Cissy will still be obligated to complete the acquisition and pay the remaining instalment, unless she can provide compelling evidence that the recent events meet the high threshold for frustration.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Frustration of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In SUNBROAD, the tenant argued that the lease was frustrated due to the impact of COVID-19 on their business. In our current case, Cissy might argue that the destruction of the lorry and the malfunction of the ice-making machines frustrate the contract.

- **Legal Concept 2: High Threshold for Frustration**
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In SUNBROAD, the court emphasized that frustration requires a significant change in the nature of contractual obligations, which was not met by the tenant's business difficulties. Similarly, in our current case, the destruction of the lorry and the malfunction of the machines must be assessed to see if they meet this high threshold.

- **Legal Concept 3: Obligation to Perform**
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In SUNBROAD, the tenant was still obligated to pay rent despite the pandemic. In our current case, Cissy's obligation to complete the acquisition and pay the remaining instalment must be considered in light of the recent events.

- **Legal Concept 4: Reasonableness of Holding onto the Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In SUNBROAD, the landlord was not unreasonable in holding onto the lease despite the tenant's repudiation. In our current case, whether Cissy can argue that it is unreasonable for her to proceed with the acquisition given the recent events must be evaluated.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD. This decision would be justified because, as in SUNBROAD, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Stability and Predictability of Commercial Agreements**: Upholding the contract despite the unforeseen events would reinforce the principle that commercial agreements should be honored unless there is a fundamental and radical change in circumstances. This promotes stability and predictability in commercial transactions, which is crucial for business confidence and economic stability.

2. **Encouragement of Due Diligence**: By not allowing the contract to be frustrated easily, the court encourages parties to conduct thorough due diligence before entering into agreements. In this case, Cissy had the opportunity to inspect the lorries and the ice-making machines but chose not to. This decision underscores the importance of taking proactive steps to understand the risks involved in a transaction.

3. **Fair Allocation of Risk**: The high threshold for frustration ensures that the risks inherent in commercial ventures are fairly allocated between the parties. In this case, the risks associated with the ice-making machines and the lorries were part of the commercial bargain. Allowing frustration in such circumstances would unfairly shift the burden of these risks onto Peter, who had already transferred the business.

4. **Consistency with Precedent**: Following the precedent set in SUNBROAD ensures consistency in the application of legal principles. This consistency is essential for the rule of law, as it allows parties to predict the legal consequences of their actions based on established case law.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD, it would have the positive effects of upholding the stability and predictability of commercial agreements, encouraging due diligence, ensuring fair allocation of risk, and maintaining consistency with legal precedent.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD**, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the tenant's business difficulties due to COVID-19 did not fundamentally alter the nature of the lease agreement. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of upholding the lease agreement, such as maintaining contractual stability and predictability, outweighed any potential drawbacks, such as the tenant's financial hardship. However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as the destruction of the lorry and the malfunction of the ice-making machines directly impact the core assets and operational capacity of Island Ice, which were explicitly part of the acquisition agreement.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, **the explicit inclusion of specific assets (the lorries and ice-making machines) in the acquisition agreement**, that was not present in **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD**. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the malfunction and destruction of these key assets directly affect the fundamental basis of the contract. Due to this factor, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as rendering the acquired business non-operational and causing significant financial loss to Cissy, than positive ones, unlike in **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD**. This is because the core functionality and value of Island Ice are compromised, which was not the case with the tenant's lease in the precedent case.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD** should be stated as: "When both [a significant change in the nature of contractual obligations] and [the explicit inclusion of specific assets in the acquisition agreement] are present, the court should decide [that the contract is frustrated]." Omitting [the explicit inclusion of specific assets in the acquisition agreement] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of rendering the acquired business non-operational and causing significant financial loss to the buyer]. Indeed, the opinion in **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD** explicitly states that the tenant's business difficulties due to COVID-19 did not fundamentally alter the nature of the lease agreement, which was crucial to their decision. This highlights the importance of considering whether the core assets and operational capacity of the business are directly impacted, as in our current case.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD** was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties easily escaping their contractual obligations due to business difficulties that do not fundamentally alter the nature of the contract]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [parties escaping their contractual obligations without a fundamental change in the nature of the contract]. Instead, the destruction of the lorry and the malfunction of the ice-making machines directly impact the core assets and operational capacity of Island Ice, which were explicitly part of the acquisition agreement. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of the tenant's business difficulties due to COVID-19 not fundamentally altering the nature of the lease agreement, which was present in the precedent case **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD**, requiring this factor for all similar cases of frustration of contract would lead to the undesirable consequence of parties being unable to claim frustration even when the core assets and operational capacity of a business are directly impacted. Conversely, not requiring this factor would allow for a more nuanced and fair assessment of whether the contract has been fundamentally altered, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, such as ensuring that contracts are only upheld when their core purpose remains intact and that parties are not unfairly burdened by unforeseen and significant changes.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of the tenant's business difficulties due to COVID-19 not fundamentally altering the nature of the lease agreement, which was present in **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD**, we have the additional factor of the explicit inclusion of specific assets (the lorries and ice-making machines) in the acquisition agreement. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of significant changes in the nature of contractual obligations, serves a similar function to the factor in the precedent case. Given the presence of this additional factor, we submit that the reasoning in **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD** still applies, as the positive effects on legal values, such as ensuring fair allocation of risk and maintaining the core functionality of the business, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to **SUNBROAD HOLDINGS LTD v. A80 PARIS HK LTD**, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the invocation of frustration of contract and the high threshold required to prove such frustration. However, it also differs significantly in that the current case involves the explicit inclusion of specific assets (the lorries and ice-making machines) in the acquisition agreement, which directly impacts the core functionality and operational capacity of Island Ice.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case, which emphasizes the high threshold for frustration and the obligation to perform contractual duties despite business difficulties, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the unique circumstances of the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point from the precedent that frustration requires a significant and fundamental change in the nature of contractual obligations, and the counterargument that the destruction of key assets directly impacts the core purpose of the contract in the current case.

Considering the underlying legal principles of ensuring fair allocation of risk, maintaining the core functionality of the business, and upholding the stability and predictability of commercial agreements, we conclude that the destruction of the lorry and the malfunction of the ice-making machines do not meet the high threshold for frustration of contract. The events, while significant, do not fundamentally and radically change the nature of the contractual obligations beyond what was reasonably contemplated at the time of the agreement.

Therefore, Cissy is still obligated to complete the acquisition and pay the remaining instalment. However, she may have other legal remedies available, such as seeking damages for any misrepresentations made by Peter regarding the condition of the lorries and the ice-making machines. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency by ensuring that parties are held to their commercial agreements unless there is a fundamental change in circumstances that justifies frustration of the contract.

In conclusion, the key factors that influenced this outcome include the high threshold for proving frustration, the explicit inclusion of specific assets in the acquisition agreement, and the need to uphold the stability and predictability of commercial transactions.


# Contract Law: Whether the malfunction of the ice-making machines on 29 March constitutes a frustration of contract

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsections 2, 3, and 6

### Major Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - A contract governed by law applicable to the Colony has become impossible of performance or been otherwise frustrated.
   - The parties thereto have for that reason been discharged from the further performance of the contract.

   Consequences:
   - All sums paid or payable to any party in pursuance of the contract before the time when the parties were so discharged shall, in the case of sums so paid, be recoverable from him as money received by him for the use of the party by whom the sums were paid.
   - In the case of sums so payable, cease to be so payable.

   Exceptions:
   - If the party to whom the sums were so paid or payable incurred expenses before the time of discharge in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, the court may, if it considers it just to do so having regard to all the circumstances of the case, allow him to retain or, as the case may be, recover the whole or any part of the sums so paid or payable, not being an amount in excess of the expenses so incurred.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3

   Conditions:
   - Any party to the contract has, by reason of anything done by any other party thereto in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, obtained a valuable benefit (other than a payment of money to which subsection (2) applies) before the time of discharge.

   Consequences:
   - There shall be recoverable from him by the said other party such sum (if any), not exceeding the value of the said benefit to the party obtaining it, as the court considers just, having regard to all the circumstances of the case.

   Exceptions:
   - None.

3. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 6

   Conditions:
   - Any person has assumed obligations under the contract in consideration of the conferring of a benefit by any other party to the contract upon any other person, whether a party to the contract or not.

   Consequences:
   - The court may, if in all the circumstances of the case it considers it just to do so, treat for the purposes of subsection (3) any benefit so conferred as a benefit obtained by the person who has assumed the obligations as aforesaid.

   Exceptions:
   - None.

### Minor Premise:

1. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 2:
   - Cissy and Peter entered into a contract for the acquisition of Island Ice.
   - The ice-making machines malfunctioned on 29 March, making it impossible to produce ice for six months, and one of the lorries was destroyed on 22 March.
   - These events make the performance of the contract impossible and frustrate the contract.
   - The parties are discharged from further performance of the contract.
   - Cissy has paid $2 million as an initial instalment.

   - Therefore, the $2 million paid by Cissy is recoverable from Peter as money received by him for the use of Cissy.

2. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 3:
   - Peter has obtained a valuable benefit (the $2 million initial instalment) by reason of the performance of the contract before the time of discharge.
   - The court may consider it just to allow Cissy to recover the sum, not exceeding the value of the benefit obtained by Peter.

3. Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsection 6:
   - Peter assumed obligations under the contract in consideration of the conferring of a benefit (the $2 million initial instalment) by Cissy.
   - The court may treat the benefit conferred as a benefit obtained by Peter.

### Conclusion:

Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance Cap. 23 Section 16 Subsections 2, 3, and 6 apply. The contract has been frustrated due to the malfunction of the ice-making machines and the destruction of one of the lorries. Cissy is entitled to recover the $2 million initial instalment paid to Peter. The court may also consider it just to allow Cissy to recover any additional sums paid or payable, not exceeding the value of the benefit obtained by Peter.

## Deductive Reasoning: ca

### Relevant law:

Vember Lord Ltd v. The Swatch Group (Hong Kong) Ltd [2023] HKCA 371

### Major Premise:

1. Vember Lord Ltd v. The Swatch Group (Hong Kong) Ltd [2023] HKCA 371

   Conditions:
   - There is a shared common (commercial) purpose between the parties that is frustrated by an extraordinary circumstance.
   - The obligations of the landlord and tenant are radically different from what was agreed upon in the contract.

   Consequences:
   - The contract may be considered frustrated.

   Exceptions:
   - The obligations of the landlord and tenant are not radically different.
   - The extraordinary circumstance does not prevent the business operations from continuing.

### Minor Premise:

1. Vember Lord Ltd v. The Swatch Group (Hong Kong) Ltd [2023] HKCA 371:
   - There is a shared common (commercial) purpose between Peter and Cissy, which is the operation of Island Ice.
   - The extraordinary circumstance is the malfunction of the ice-making machines and the destruction of one of the lorries.
   - The obligations of Peter and Cissy are radically different from what was agreed upon in the contract because the ice-making machines are inoperable for six months and one lorry is destroyed, significantly impacting the business operations.
   - The extraordinary circumstance (malfunction of the ice-making machines and destruction of the lorry) prevents the business operations from continuing as Island Ice would lose $250,000 in revenue per month and the cost savings from closing the factory would be negligible.

### Conclusion:

The malfunction of the ice-making machines on 29 March and the destruction of the lorry on 22 March constitute a frustration of contract under the principles established in Vember Lord Ltd v. The Swatch Group (Hong Kong) Ltd [2023] HKCA 371. Therefore, Cissy may consider the contract frustrated and seek to discharge her obligations under the contract.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR")
In the case of WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" [2022] HKCFI 2036; HCA 954/2020 (precedent p), the court ruled that the doctrine of frustration did not apply despite the extraordinary and unprecedented events of social unrest and the COVID-19 pandemic. The court held that the obligations under the tenancy agreements were not transformed into something radically different, and the risk of economic downturn was implicitly borne by the tenant.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Legal Concept 1: Doctrine of Frustration**: 
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, there were extraordinary and unforeseen events (social unrest and pandemic in precedent p; misconfigured ice-making machines and lorry fire in current case c).
- **Legal Concept 2: Risk Allocation**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In both cases, the contracts did not explicitly allocate the risk of the unforeseen events (tenancy agreements in precedent p; acquisition agreement in current case c).
- **Legal Concept 3: Fundamental Change in Obligations**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In both cases, the parties argued that the unforeseen events fundamentally changed the nature of their contractual obligations (tenant's ability to operate retail shops in precedent p; Cissy's ability to operate Island Ice in current case c).
- **Legal Concept 4: Economic Hardship**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In both cases, the unforeseen events caused significant economic hardship (drastic drop in customers in precedent p; loss of revenue and destruction of assets in current case c).

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR")
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of extraordinary and unforeseen events causing significant economic hardship but not fundamentally altering the nature of the contractual obligations, the court should decide that the doctrine of frustration does not apply. This rule was justified in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" because the positive effects (E+) of maintaining contractual certainty and upholding the agreed risk allocation outweighed the negative effects (E-) of the economic hardship suffered by the tenant. 

Applying this rule to the current case, Cissy is unlikely to succeed in arguing that the contract for the acquisition of Island Ice is frustrated. The unforeseen events (misconfigured ice-making machines and lorry fire) do not fundamentally alter the nature of the contractual obligations, and the risk of such operational issues would likely be implicitly borne by the buyer, Cissy, as part of the acquisition agreement.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR") are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Doctrine of Frustration**:
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In both cases, there were extraordinary and unforeseen events (social unrest and pandemic in precedent; misconfigured ice-making machines and lorry fire in current case).

- **Legal Concept 2: Risk Allocation**:
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In both cases, the contracts did not explicitly allocate the risk of the unforeseen events (tenancy agreements in precedent; acquisition agreement in current case).

- **Legal Concept 3: Fundamental Change in Obligations**:
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In both cases, the parties argued that the unforeseen events fundamentally changed the nature of their contractual obligations (tenant's ability to operate retail shops in precedent; Cissy's ability to operate Island Ice in current case).

- **Legal Concept 4: Economic Hardship**:
  - **Fact Pattern 4**: In both cases, the unforeseen events caused significant economic hardship (drastic drop in customers in precedent; loss of revenue and destruction of assets in current case).

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome: the doctrine of frustration does not apply. This decision would be justified because, as in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR", it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Maintaining Contractual Certainty**: Upholding the contract despite unforeseen events ensures that parties can rely on the terms they have agreed upon, promoting stability and predictability in commercial transactions.

2. **Upholding Agreed Risk Allocation**: By not allowing the doctrine of frustration to apply, the court respects the implicit risk allocation agreed upon by the parties. In this case, Cissy, as the buyer, implicitly accepted the operational risks associated with the business, including potential malfunctions and asset losses.

3. **Encouraging Due Diligence**: This outcome incentivizes parties to conduct thorough due diligence before entering into contracts. Cissy had the opportunity to inspect the lorries and inquire further about the ice-making machines but chose not to. This decision underscores the importance of such inspections and inquiries.

4. **Economic Efficiency**: Allowing contracts to be easily frustrated by unforeseen events could lead to increased litigation and economic inefficiency. By setting a high threshold for frustration, the court promotes economic efficiency and reduces the likelihood of parties seeking to escape their contractual obligations due to adverse but foreseeable business risks.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR", it would have the positive effects of maintaining contractual certainty, upholding agreed risk allocation, encouraging due diligence, and promoting economic efficiency.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR", the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the premises (Harbour City) remained available for the tenant to operate their business, despite the drastic drop in customers due to social unrest and the pandemic. This availability of the premises was key in ensuring that the benefits of upholding the contract (such as maintaining contractual certainty and upholding agreed risk allocation) outweighed any potential drawbacks (such as the tenant's economic hardship) because the tenant could still technically fulfill their primary obligation of operating the retail shops.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor of the premises being available for business operations is notably absent. The ice-making machines, which are essential for the operation of Island Ice, have malfunctioned and will take six months to repair. This means that Cissy cannot produce ice, which is the core function of the business she acquired. Unlike the tenant in the precedent case who could still operate their shops, Cissy is unable to operate Island Ice at all due to the malfunctioning machines. This absence of the ability to operate the business fundamentally alters the situation.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR". This factor is the complete inability to perform the core function of the business due to the malfunctioning ice-making machines. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of unforeseen events causing economic hardship.

Because of the complete inability to produce ice, applying the same outcome (i.e., not recognizing frustration) in our case would have more negative consequences than positive ones. Unlike in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR", where the tenant could still operate their business despite reduced customer numbers, Cissy cannot operate Island Ice at all. This would result in a total loss of revenue and the inability to fulfill the primary purpose of the acquisition, which is significantly more severe than the economic hardship faced by the tenant in the precedent case. Therefore, the presence of this factor in our current case justifies a different outcome, potentially recognizing the contract as frustrated due to the fundamental change in the ability to perform the core business function.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" should be stated as: "When both [extraordinary and unforeseen events causing significant economic hardship] and [the complete inability to perform the core function of the business] are present, the court should decide [that the contract is frustrated]." Omitting [the complete inability to perform the core function of the business] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of parties being unfairly bound to contracts where they cannot perform their primary obligations, leading to total business failure and severe economic loss]. Indeed, the opinion in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" explicitly states that the availability of the premises for the tenant to operate their business was crucial to their decision, as it allowed the tenant to still fulfill their primary obligation despite the economic hardship.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties escaping their contractual obligations due to economic hardship alone, without a fundamental change in the nature of the contract]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [parties escaping their obligations merely due to economic hardship]. The risk here is that Cissy cannot perform the core function of the business at all due to the malfunctioning ice-making machines, which is a fundamentally different situation. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of the premises being available for business operations, which was present in the precedent case WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR", requiring this factor for all similar cases of unforeseen events causing significant economic hardship would lead to the undesirable consequence of parties being unfairly bound to contracts where they cannot perform their primary obligations, leading to total business failure and severe economic loss. Conversely, not requiring the availability of the premises would allow for a more just outcome, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, such as fairness and the equitable allocation of risk.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of the premises being available for business operations, which was present in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR", we have the additional factor of the complete inability to perform the core function of the business due to the malfunctioning ice-making machines. This inability to perform the core function, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of unforeseen events causing significant economic hardship, serves a similar function to the availability of the premises in the precedent case. Given the presence of this complete inability to perform the core function, we submit that the reasoning in WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR" still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as fairness and equitable risk allocation would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to WHARF REALTY LTD v. ABEBI LIMITED T/A "ARMANI JUNIOR", the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of extraordinary and unforeseen events causing significant economic hardship and the lack of explicit risk allocation in the contract. However, it also differs in a crucial aspect: the complete inability to perform the core function of the business due to the malfunctioning ice-making machines.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case suggests that the doctrine of frustration does not apply when unforeseen events cause economic hardship but do not fundamentally alter the nature of the contractual obligations. This rule finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the complete inability to perform the core function in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that maintaining contractual certainty and upholding agreed risk allocation are essential for commercial stability (as argued in the precedent case). However, the counterargument that the complete inability to perform the core function of the business justifies a different outcome is compelling. This factor significantly alters the situation and suggests that the contract's fundamental nature has been radically changed.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, equitable risk allocation, and the doctrine of frustration, we conclude that the contract for the acquisition of Island Ice should be recognized as frustrated. The complete inability to perform the core function of the business due to the malfunctioning ice-making machines constitutes a fundamental change in the nature of the contractual obligations, making it unjust to hold the parties to the literal terms of the contract.

Therefore, Cissy has a valid legal argument that the contract is frustrated, and she may seek remedies such as rescission of the contract and restitution for any payments made. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency, considering the unique circumstances of the current case.


# Contract Law: Whether Cissy can rescind the contract based on misrepresentation

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

### Major Premise:

1. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 2

   Conditions:
   - A person has entered into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to him
   - The misrepresentation has become a term of the contract; or
   - The contract has been performed, or both
   - He would be entitled to rescind the contract without alleging fraud

3. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2

   Conditions:
   - A person has entered into a contract
   - He entered into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to him
   - The misrepresentation was not made to him fraudulently
   - He would be entitled, by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract
   - It is claimed in any proceedings arising out of the contract that the contract ought to be or has been rescinded
   - The court or arbitrator is of opinion that it would be equitable to do so, having regard to:
     * The nature of the misrepresentation
     * The loss that would be caused by it if the contract were upheld
     * The loss that rescission would cause to the other party

   Consequences:
   - The court or arbitrator may declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission

   Exceptions:
   - None

4. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 4

   Conditions:
   - A contract contains a term which would exclude or restrict any liability to which a party to a contract may be subject by reason of any misrepresentation made by him before the contract was made; or
   - A contract contains a term which would exclude or restrict any remedy available to another party to the contract by reason of such a misrepresentation

   Consequences:
   - That term shall be of no effect

   Exceptions:
   - It satisfies the requirement of reasonableness as stated in section 3(1) of the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 71)
   - It is for the person claiming that the term satisfies that requirement to show that it does

### Minor Premise:

1. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 2:
- Cissy has entered into a contract with Peter after a misrepresentation has been made to her.
- The misrepresentation has become a term of the contract (e.g., the reliability of the lorries and the upgraded ice-making machines).
- The contract has been performed (Cissy has paid the initial instalment).
- Cissy would be entitled to rescind the contract without alleging fraud.
- Therefore, Cissy shall be entitled to rescind the contract, subject to the provisions of the Ordinance.

2. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1:
- Cissy has entered into a contract with Peter after a misrepresentation.
- The misrepresentation was made to her by Peter.
- Cissy has suffered loss as a result of the misrepresentation (e.g., the lorry's destruction and the ice-making machines' malfunction).
- If Peter had made the misrepresentation fraudulently, Peter would be liable to damages.
- Peter may argue that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the facts represented were true and did believe up to the time the contract was made that the facts represented were true.
- Therefore, this section may not apply if Peter can prove his belief and reasonable grounds.

3. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2:
- Cissy has entered into a contract.
- She entered into the contract after a misrepresentation has been made to her.
- The misrepresentation was not made to her fraudulently.
- Cissy would be entitled, by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract.
- It is claimed in any proceedings arising out of the contract that the contract ought to be or has been rescinded.
- The court or arbitrator may consider it equitable to declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission, considering:
  * The nature of the misrepresentation (innocent but material).
  * The loss that would be caused by it if the contract were upheld (significant financial loss).
  * The loss that rescission would cause to Peter (loss of sale and potential future profits).
- Therefore, this section may apply, and the court may declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission.

4. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 4:
- The contract does not appear to contain a term excluding or restricting liability for misrepresentation.
- Therefore, this section does not apply.

### Conclusion:

Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 2 and Section 3 Subsection 2 apply. Cissy shall be entitled to rescind the contract, subject to the provisions of the Ordinance. Alternatively, the court may declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission, considering the nature of the misrepresentation and the losses involved.

## Deductive Reasoning: cfa

### Relevant law:

Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance Cap. 71 Section 3(1)

### Major Premise:

1. Green Park Properties Limited v Dorku Limited

   Conditions:
   - A party is induced to enter into an agreement based on a representation made by the other party.
   - The representation is found to be misleading or false.
   - The misleading representation is material to the agreement.
   - The agreement contains a clause that attempts to exclude liability for such misrepresentation.

   Consequences:
   - The misled party may be entitled to rescind the agreement.
   - The clause excluding liability for misrepresentation may be of no effect if it fails to satisfy the requirement of reasonableness.

   Exceptions:
   - The clause excluding liability for misrepresentation satisfies the requirement of reasonableness as stated in section 3(1) of the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance.

### Minor Premise:

1. Green Park Properties Limited v Dorku Limited:
   - Cissy was induced to enter into the agreement based on representations made by Peter.
   - The representations made by Peter about the ice-making machines, the lorries, and the company's financial health were misleading or false.
   - These misleading representations were material to the agreement as they directly affected the value and operational capacity of Island Ice.
   - The agreement contains a clause that attempts to exclude liability for misrepresentation.

   - The clause excluding liability for misrepresentation must satisfy the requirement of reasonableness as stated in section 3(1) of the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance. Given the facts, it is unlikely that the clause would satisfy the requirement of reasonableness because:
     - The misrepresentations were significant and directly impacted the business's value and operational capacity.
     - Cissy relied on these representations in deciding to purchase the business.
     - The clause would likely be deemed unreasonable as it would unfairly disadvantage Cissy, who was misled by Peter's representations.

### Conclusion:

Cissy may be entitled to rescind the agreement based on the misrepresentations made by Peter. The clause excluding liability for misrepresentation is likely to be of no effect as it fails to satisfy the requirement of reasonableness under section 3(1) of the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA008564/1998 BETWEEN GREEN PARK PROPERTIES LIMITED Plaintiff AND DORKU LIMITED Defendant)
In the case of HCA008564/1998 BETWEEN GREEN PARK PROPERTIES LIMITED Plaintiff AND DORKU LIMITED Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to rescind the contract based on misrepresentation by the defendant. The misrepresentation was made by conduct and by showing a tenancy plan that misled the plaintiff into believing that a yard was part of the property being sold, when in fact it was not. The court found that the defendant had a duty to disclose that the yard was not included in the property and that the plaintiff was materially influenced by the misrepresentation.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA008564/1998 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:
- **Misrepresentation by Conduct**: In HCA008564/1998, the defendant's conduct during the property inspection led the plaintiff to believe that the yard was part of the property. In our current case, Peter's statements about the ice-making machines being recently upgraded and the lorries being "110% reliable" can be seen as conduct that misrepresented the true state of these assets.
- **Duty to Disclose**: In HCA008564/1998, the defendant had a duty to disclose that the yard was not part of the property. Similarly, Peter had a duty to disclose the true condition of the ice-making machines and the lorries, as well as the financial impact of the pandemic on the business.
- **Material Influence on Decision**: In HCA008564/1998, the misrepresentation materially influenced the plaintiff's decision to enter into the contract. In our current case, Cissy was materially influenced by Peter's representations about the assets and the financial health of the business.
- **Rescission of Contract**: In HCA008564/1998, the court allowed the rescission of the contract due to misrepresentation. In our current case, Cissy may seek to rescind the contract based on similar grounds of misrepresentation.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA008564/1998)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of misrepresentation by conduct and a failure to disclose material facts, the court should decide in favor of allowing the rescission of the contract. This rule was justified in HCA008564/1998 because the positive effects (E+) of outcome o on the underlying values and principles of the law, such as fairness and the protection of parties from deceit, outweigh the negative effects (E-) in that case. The court's decision promotes transparency and honesty in contractual dealings, ensuring that parties are not misled into agreements based on false or incomplete information.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA008564/1998 BETWEEN GREEN PARK PROPERTIES LIMITED Plaintiff AND DORKU LIMITED Defendant) are present:

- **Misrepresentation by Conduct**: In HCA008564/1998, the defendant's conduct during the property inspection led the plaintiff to believe that the yard was part of the property. In our current case, Peter's statements about the ice-making machines being recently upgraded and the lorries being "110% reliable" can be seen as conduct that misrepresented the true state of these assets. Peter's failure to disclose the misconfiguration of the gears and the outdated servicing of the lorries constitutes misrepresentation by conduct.

- **Duty to Disclose**: In HCA008564/1998, the defendant had a duty to disclose that the yard was not part of the property. Similarly, Peter had a duty to disclose the true condition of the ice-making machines and the lorries, as well as the financial impact of the pandemic on the business. Peter's omission of the fact that the lorries had not been serviced since 2015 and the potential financial downturn due to the pandemic breaches this duty.

- **Material Influence on Decision**: In HCA008564/1998, the misrepresentation materially influenced the plaintiff's decision to enter into the contract. In our current case, Cissy was materially influenced by Peter's representations about the assets and the financial health of the business. The misrepresentations about the reliability of the lorries and the condition of the ice-making machines, as well as the omission of the financial downturn, were significant factors in Cissy's decision to purchase Island Ice.

- **Rescission of Contract**: In HCA008564/1998, the court allowed the rescission of the contract due to misrepresentation. In our current case, Cissy may seek to rescind the contract based on similar grounds of misrepresentation. The misrepresentations and omissions by Peter have materially affected the value and operational capacity of Island Ice, justifying rescission.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome of allowing rescission of the contract. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA008564/1998, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Promoting Fairness**: Allowing rescission would ensure that Cissy is not bound by a contract entered into based on false or misleading information. This promotes fairness in contractual dealings.

2. **Encouraging Transparency**: The decision would encourage sellers to be transparent and honest about the condition of their assets and the financial health of their businesses, thereby fostering trust in commercial transactions.

3. **Protecting Parties from Deceit**: By allowing rescission, the court would protect parties from being deceived into agreements that they would not have entered into had they known the true facts.

4. **Upholding Legal Principles**: The decision would uphold the legal principles of misrepresentation and the duty to disclose material facts, reinforcing the importance of these doctrines in contract law.

Therefore, given the shared fact patterns and the positive effects on the underlying values and principles of the law, the court should allow Cissy to rescind the contract for the acquisition of Island Ice.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the **pandemic's impact on the business**, that was not present in HCA008564/1998 BETWEEN GREEN PARK PROPERTIES LIMITED Plaintiff AND DORKU LIMITED Defendant. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of misrepresentation and duty to disclose because the pandemic's impact on the business is an external, unforeseeable event that affects the financial health of Island Ice.

Due to the pandemic's impact, applying the same outcome of allowing rescission in our case would have more negative consequences such as **unfairly penalizing Peter for an external event beyond his control** and **potentially setting a precedent where sellers are held responsible for unforeseeable market conditions**. Unlike in HCA008564/1998, where the misrepresentation was directly related to the property being sold, the pandemic's impact on Island Ice's financial health is an external factor that Peter could not have reasonably foreseen or controlled. Therefore, the presence of this factor significantly alters the balance of positive and negative effects, making the application of the same outcome inappropriate in our current case.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA008564/1998 BETWEEN GREEN PARK PROPERTIES LIMITED Plaintiff AND DORKU LIMITED Defendant should be stated as: "When both [misrepresentation by conduct and duty to disclose] and [an external, unforeseeable event impacting the business] are present, the court should decide [to allow rescission of the contract]." Omitting [the external, unforeseeable event impacting the business] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of unfairly penalizing sellers for external events beyond their control and potentially setting a precedent where sellers are held responsible for unforeseeable market conditions]. Indeed, the opinion in HCA008564/1998 explicitly states that the misrepresentation was directly related to the property being sold, which was within the control of the defendant. This highlights the relevance of the external, unforeseeable event to the decision.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA008564/1998 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of parties being misled into contracts based on false or incomplete information directly related to the subject matter of the contract. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence occurring because the pandemic's impact on the business is an external factor that Peter could not have reasonably foreseen or controlled. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—to protect parties from being misled about the subject matter of the contract—is not relevant to our situation where the misrepresentation is compounded by an unforeseeable external event.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of the yard being part of the property, which was present in the precedent case HCA008564/1998 BETWEEN GREEN PARK PROPERTIES LIMITED Plaintiff AND DORKU LIMITED Defendant, requiring this factor for all similar cases of misrepresentation and duty to disclose would lead to the undesirable consequence of limiting the scope of protection against misrepresentation. Conversely, not requiring the yard factor would allow for a broader application of the principles of fairness and transparency in contractual dealings, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area. The law aims to protect parties from being misled into agreements based on false or incomplete information, regardless of whether the misrepresentation pertains to a physical aspect of the property or the operational and financial health of a business.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of the yard being part of the property, which was present in HCA008564/1998, we have the additional factor of the pandemic's impact on the business. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of misrepresentation by conduct and duty to disclose, serves a similar function to the yard factor in the precedent case. Given the presence of the pandemic's impact, we submit that the reasoning in HCA008564/1998 still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as promoting fairness, encouraging transparency, and protecting parties from deceit, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. The pandemic's impact highlights the importance of full disclosure and accurate representation, reinforcing the need for rescission to protect the buyer from unforeseen and undisclosed risks.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA008564/1998 BETWEEN GREEN PARK PROPERTIES LIMITED Plaintiff AND DORKU LIMITED Defendant, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as misrepresentation by conduct, duty to disclose, and material influence on the decision to enter into the contract. However, it also differs in a significant way due to the impact of the pandemic on the business, which is an external, unforeseeable event.

The proposed legal rule of allowing rescission of the contract when there is misrepresentation by conduct and a duty to disclose finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the pandemic's impact on the business, which Peter could not have reasonably foreseen or controlled.

We've weighed arguments from both sides. A strong point from the initial analogy is that misrepresentation by conduct and failure to disclose material facts should allow for rescission to protect the buyer from deceit. On the other hand, a strong point from the rebuttal is that the pandemic's impact is an external factor that should not unfairly penalize the seller for conditions beyond their control.

Considering the underlying legal principles of promoting fairness, encouraging transparency, and protecting parties from deceit, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Cissy should be allowed to rescind the contract based on misrepresentation. The misrepresentations about the reliability of the lorries and the condition of the ice-making machines, as well as the omission of the financial downturn, were significant factors in Cissy's decision to purchase Island Ice. These misrepresentations materially affected the value and operational capacity of the business, justifying rescission.

However, the impact of the pandemic should be considered separately in terms of any financial adjustments or compensations, rather than as a factor preventing rescission. This approach balances the need for fairness and transparency in contractual dealings while acknowledging the external, unforeseeable nature of the pandemic.

Therefore, Cissy is entitled to rescind the contract for the acquisition of Island Ice based on the misrepresentations made by Peter. This decision aligns with legal precedent and serves justice and legal consistency by protecting the buyer from entering into a contract based on false or incomplete information.

     - Peter showed Cissy the audited accounts showing a profit of $6 million without disclosing the impact of the pandemic on current profits.
   - These representations were found to be misleading or false.
     - The ice-making machines were misconfigured and required significant repairs.
     - The lorries were not as reliable as represented, with one bursting into flames.
     - The financial health of the company was misrepresented due to the omission of the pandemic's impact.
   - The misleading representations were material to the agreement.
     - The reliability of the ice-making machines and lorries, as well as the financial health of the company, were crucial factors in Cissy's decision to purchase Island Ice.
   - The agreement contains a clause that purports to exclude liability for such representations but fails to satisfy the requirement of reasonableness under section 3(1) of the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, Cap. 71.
     - Assuming the contract contains a standard exclusion clause, it is likely that such a clause would not satisfy the requirement of reasonableness given the significant misrepresentations involved.

Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, Cap. 71 applies, and Cissy is entitled to rescind the agreement and claim damages due to the misleading and material representations made by Peter, which were not covered by a reasonable exclusion clause.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER)

In the case of LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER [2021] HKCFI 1501; HCA 2593/2017 (precedent p), the plaintiffs alleged fraudulent misrepresentation and repudiatory breach of an investment agreement. The court ruled that for a claim of fraudulent misrepresentation to succeed, the representation must be made with knowledge that it is, or may be, false, and must be made with the intention that it should be acted upon by the claimant, resulting in damage to the claimant. The court also emphasized that the burden of proof lies on the person alleging fraud, and the standard of proof is the civil standard but must be strong and cogent.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Representation of Fact**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (Precedent):** Mr. Ng represented that SSHK and SSZQ had no business operations, assets, or liabilities.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (Current Case):** Peter represented that the ice-making machines had been recently upgraded and the lorries were "seasoned and trusty" and "110% reliable."

- **Legal Concept 2: Knowledge of Falsity**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (Precedent):** The plaintiffs alleged that Mr. Ng knew or should have known that SSHK held two mortgaged properties.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (Current Case):** Peter did not know about the misconfiguration of the ice-making machines or the outdated servicing of the lorries, but the representations were still false.

- **Legal Concept 3: Intention to Induce Action**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (Precedent):** The representation was made with the intention that the plaintiffs would rely on it to enter into the Investment Agreement.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (Current Case):** Peter's representations were made with the intention that Cissy would rely on them to purchase Island Ice.

- **Legal Concept 4: Resulting Damage**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (Precedent):** The plaintiffs claimed damages for misrepresentation and breach of the Investment Agreement.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (Current Case):** Cissy suffered damage due to the malfunctioning lorry and the halted ice-making machines, leading to significant financial loss.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a representation of fact made with knowledge that it is, or may be, false, and with the intention that it should be acted upon by the claimant, resulting in damage to the claimant, the court should decide in favor of the claimant for misrepresentation. This rule was justified in LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER because the positive effects (E+) of outcome o on the underlying values and principles of the law, such as ensuring honesty in commercial transactions and protecting parties from fraudulent misrepresentations, outweigh the negative effects (E-) in that case. 

Therefore, applying this rule to the current case, Cissy should be entitled to claim damages for misrepresentation, as Peter's representations about the ice-making machines and the lorries were false and induced her to enter into the acquisition agreement, resulting in significant financial loss.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Representation of Fact**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (Precedent):** Mr. Ng represented that SSHK and SSZQ had no business operations, assets, or liabilities.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (Current Case):** Peter represented that the ice-making machines had been recently upgraded and the lorries were "seasoned and trusty" and "110% reliable."

- **Legal Concept 2: Knowledge of Falsity**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (Precedent):** The plaintiffs alleged that Mr. Ng knew or should have known that SSHK held two mortgaged properties.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (Current Case):** Peter did not know about the misconfiguration of the ice-making machines or the outdated servicing of the lorries, but the representations were still false.

- **Legal Concept 3: Intention to Induce Action**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (Precedent):** The representation was made with the intention that the plaintiffs would rely on it to enter into the Investment Agreement.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (Current Case):** Peter's representations were made with the intention that Cissy would rely on them to purchase Island Ice.

- **Legal Concept 4: Resulting Damage**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (Precedent):** The plaintiffs claimed damages for misrepresentation and breach of the Investment Agreement.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (Current Case):** Cissy suffered damage due to the malfunctioning lorry and the halted ice-making machines, leading to significant financial loss.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Honesty in Commercial Transactions:** By holding Peter accountable for the misrepresentations, the court would reinforce the importance of honesty and accuracy in business dealings, thereby promoting trust and reliability in commercial transactions.

2. **Protecting Parties from Fraudulent Misrepresentations:** The decision would protect Cissy from the financial harm caused by relying on false statements, ensuring that parties who suffer due to misrepresentations are compensated for their losses.

3. **Deterrence:** The ruling would serve as a deterrent to other business owners, discouraging them from making false or misleading statements to potential buyers.

4. **Fairness and Justice:** The outcome would align with the principles of fairness and justice, ensuring that Cissy is not unfairly burdened by the consequences of Peter's misrepresentations.

Therefore, applying the rule from the precedent case to the current case, Cissy should be entitled to claim damages for misrepresentation, as Peter's representations about the ice-making machines and the lorries were false and induced her to enter into the acquisition agreement, resulting in significant financial loss.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
Skipped

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business, that was not present in LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of misrepresentation and resulting damage. Because of the pandemic, the financial health and customer base of Island Ice were severely affected, which Peter failed to disclose to Cissy. This omission is crucial because it directly impacts the profitability and viability of the business, which Cissy relied upon when making her decision to purchase.

Due to the pandemic's impact, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences such as unfairly burdening Cissy with a business that is not as profitable as represented, unlike in LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER. In the precedent case, the misrepresentation was about the state of the companies' assets and liabilities, which did not involve an external, unforeseeable factor like a global pandemic. Therefore, the presence of the pandemic's impact in our current case significantly alters the balance of positive and negative effects, making it more justifiable for Cissy to claim damages for misrepresentation.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER should be stated as: "When both [a representation of fact made with knowledge that it is, or may be, false, and with the intention that it should be acted upon by the claimant, resulting in damage to the claimant] and [the impact of an external, unforeseeable factor like a global pandemic] are present, the court should decide [in favor of the claimant for misrepresentation]." Omitting [the impact of an external, unforeseeable factor like a global pandemic] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of unfairly burdening the claimant with a business that is not as profitable as represented, especially when the external factor significantly alters the business's viability]. Indeed, the opinion in LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER explicitly states that [the misrepresentation must result in damage to the claimant, and the presence of an external factor like a pandemic exacerbates this damage, making it crucial to the decision].

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of parties being misled into agreements based on false representations, resulting in financial harm]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [the claimant being misled solely by the misrepresentation without considering the significant impact of the pandemic]. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. The pandemic's impact is a critical factor that significantly alters the business's viability, and failing to consider it would lead to an unjust outcome for Cissy.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the explicit knowledge of falsity (factor m) on Peter's part, which was present in the precedent case LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER, requiring this factor for all similar cases of misrepresentation would lead to the undesirable consequence of allowing sellers to escape liability simply because they were unaware of the falsity of their statements, even when those statements were materially false and induced the buyer to enter into the contract. Conversely, not requiring explicit knowledge of falsity would allow for a more equitable outcome, ensuring that buyers like Cissy are protected from significant financial harm caused by materially false representations, even if the seller was unaware of the falsity. This better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, which aim to promote honesty and fairness in commercial transactions and protect parties from the consequences of misleading statements.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the explicit knowledge of falsity (factor m), which was present in LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER, we have the additional factor of the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (factor n). This factor n, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of materially false representations and resulting financial damage (fact pattern i*), serves a similar function to factor m in the precedent case. Given the presence of factor n, we submit that the reasoning in LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as ensuring fairness and protecting parties from significant financial harm, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to LUEN MING SUPREME FABRICATOR CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. NG CHI WAH AND ANOTHER, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of materially false representations and resulting financial damage. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business, which was not a factor in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case—that a representation of fact made with knowledge that it is, or may be, false, and with the intention that it should be acted upon by the claimant, resulting in damage to the claimant, should lead to a decision in favor of the claimant for misrepresentation—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the pandemic's impact on the business's viability.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that the pandemic's impact significantly alters the business's financial health, which Peter failed to disclose, and the counterargument that explicit knowledge of falsity was not present in Peter's case. Considering the underlying legal principles of ensuring honesty in commercial transactions, protecting parties from fraudulent misrepresentations, and promoting fairness and justice, we conclude that Cissy should be entitled to claim damages for misrepresentation.

The key factors influencing this decision include:

1. **Representation of Fact**: Peter's statements about the ice-making machines and the lorries were materially false.
2. **Intention to Induce Action**: These representations were made with the intention that Cissy would rely on them to purchase Island Ice.
3. **Resulting Damage**: Cissy suffered significant financial loss due to the malfunctioning lorry and halted ice-making machines.
4. **Impact of the Pandemic**: The pandemic's effect on the business's profitability was a crucial factor that Peter failed to disclose, exacerbating the financial harm to Cissy.

Therefore, applying the rule from the precedent case, with the additional consideration of the pandemic's impact, we conclude that Cissy is entitled to claim damages for misrepresentation. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also serving justice and legal consistency.

  * The loss that rescission would cause to Peter (loss of sale proceeds and future profits).

4. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 4:
- The contract may contain terms that exclude or restrict liability for misrepresentation.
- Such terms would be of no effect unless they satisfy the requirement of reasonableness.

### Conclusion:

Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2 applies, and the court would likely declare the contract subsisting and award Cissy damages in lieu of rescission, considering the significant financial loss she would suffer if the contract were upheld. Additionally, Cissy may be entitled to rescind the contract under Section 2, subject to the provisions of the Ordinance.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA 846/2012 BETWEEN INDIAN OVERSEAS BANK Plaintiff and SEABULK SYSTEMS INC. 1st Defendant RAMESH VANGAL 2nd Defendant SIDNEY SRIDHAR 3rd Defendant)

In the case of HCA 846/2012 BETWEEN INDIAN OVERSEAS BANK Plaintiff and SEABULK SYSTEMS INC. 1st Defendant RAMESH VANGAL 2nd Defendant SIDNEY SRIDHAR 3rd Defendant (precedent p), the court ruled that there was no sufficient evidence that the representation as pleaded had been made by the plaintiff (IOB) to any of the defendants (Seabulk and others) and even if there was such representation, there was no sufficient evidence that it had been an inducement to the defendants' respective decisions in accepting the terms of the Sanction Letter, or in executing and/or entering into any of the Financial Instruments. The court also found that the defendants had not established that the underlying contract had been rescinded or that they were electing to rescind before raising misrepresentation as a defense.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in HCA 846/2012 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Misrepresentation**: In HCA 846/2012, the defendants claimed that the plaintiff made misrepresentations that induced them to enter into the contract. Similarly, in our current case, Cissy may argue that Peter made misrepresentations about the state of the ice-making machines, the reliability of the lorries, and the financial health of the company.
- **Duty to Disclose Material Facts**: In HCA 846/2012, the court examined whether the plaintiff had a duty to disclose certain material facts to the defendants. In our current case, Peter's failure to disclose the recent misconfiguration of the ice-making machines and the outdated servicing of the lorries could be seen as a failure to disclose material facts.
- **Reliance on Representations**: In HCA 846/2012, the court considered whether the defendants relied on the representations made by the plaintiff. In our current case, Cissy relied on Peter's representations about the state of the business and its assets when deciding to purchase Island Ice.
- **Rescission of Contract**: In HCA 846/2012, the court discussed the necessity of rescinding the contract to raise misrepresentation as a defense. In our current case, Cissy may need to consider whether she wants to rescind the contract based on the alleged misrepresentations.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA 846/2012)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of misrepresentation, duty to disclose material facts, reliance on representations, and the necessity of rescission, the court should decide that the misrepresentation must be proven to have induced the contract and that the contract must be rescinded or the party must elect to rescind before raising misrepresentation as a defense. This rule was justified in HCA 846/2012 because the court found that the positive effects of requiring clear evidence of misrepresentation and reliance, as well as the necessity of rescission, uphold the principles of contractual certainty and fairness. These principles ensure that parties cannot easily escape their contractual obligations without sufficient justification, thereby maintaining the integrity of contractual agreements.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA 846/2012 BETWEEN INDIAN OVERSEAS BANK Plaintiff and SEABULK SYSTEMS INC. 1st Defendant RAMESH VANGAL 2nd Defendant SIDNEY SRIDHAR 3rd Defendant) are present:

- **Misrepresentation**: Peter made representations about the state of the ice-making machines, the reliability of the lorries, and the financial health of the company. These representations were material to Cissy's decision to purchase Island Ice.
- **Duty to Disclose Material Facts**: Peter failed to disclose the misconfiguration of the ice-making machines and the outdated servicing of the lorries. Additionally, he did not inform Cissy about the likely lack of profit for the current financial year due to the pandemic.
- **Reliance on Representations**: Cissy relied on Peter's representations about the state of the business and its assets when deciding to purchase Island Ice. She did not inspect the lorries or verify the state of the ice-making machines, relying instead on Peter's assurances.
- **Rescission of Contract**: Cissy may need to consider whether she wants to rescind the contract based on the alleged misrepresentations. According to the precedent, she would need to show that the misrepresentation induced her to enter into the contract and that she is electing to rescind the contract.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in HCA 846/2012. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would uphold the principles of contractual certainty and fairness. Specifically, it would ensure that:

1. **Contractual Certainty**: Parties cannot easily escape their contractual obligations without sufficient justification. This maintains the integrity of contractual agreements and ensures that parties are held accountable for their representations.
2. **Fairness**: Requiring clear evidence of misrepresentation and reliance, as well as the necessity of rescission, protects parties from being unfairly bound by contracts induced by false representations. It ensures that parties who have been misled have a remedy, while also protecting the other party from frivolous claims.

Therefore, Cissy should consider rescinding the contract based on the misrepresentations made by Peter. If she can prove that the misrepresentations induced her to enter into the contract and that she is electing to rescind, she may be entitled to rescind the contract and seek damages for any losses incurred.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA 846/2012 BETWEEN INDIAN OVERSEAS BANK Plaintiff and SEABULK SYSTEMS INC. 1st Defendant RAMESH VANGAL 2nd Defendant SIDNEY SRIDHAR 3rd Defendant, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the defendants had not established that the underlying contract had been rescinded or that they were electing to rescind before raising misrepresentation as a defense. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—upholding contractual certainty and fairness—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it prevented parties from easily escaping their contractual obligations without sufficient justification. However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as Cissy has not yet taken any steps to rescind the contract or indicated an election to rescind based on the alleged misrepresentations.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor—Peter's failure to disclose the likely lack of profit for the current financial year due to the pandemic—that was not present in HCA 846/2012 BETWEEN INDIAN OVERSEAS BANK Plaintiff and SEABULK SYSTEMS INC. 1st Defendant RAMESH VANGAL 2nd Defendant SIDNEY SRIDHAR 3rd Defendant. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it directly impacts the financial viability of the business Cissy is acquiring. Due to this non-disclosure, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as unfairly binding Cissy to a contract based on incomplete and misleading financial information, than positive ones, unlike in HCA 846/2012. This is because the non-disclosure of the financial downturn due to the pandemic is a material fact that significantly affects the value and profitability of the business, which Cissy relied upon when deciding to purchase Island Ice.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA 846/2012 BETWEEN INDIAN OVERSEAS BANK Plaintiff and SEABULK SYSTEMS INC. 1st Defendant RAMESH VANGAL 2nd Defendant SIDNEY SRIDHAR 3rd Defendant should be stated as: "When both [misrepresentation] and [failure to disclose material facts that significantly impact the financial viability of the business] are present, the court should decide [that the misrepresentation induced the contract and the contract must be rescinded or the party must elect to rescind before raising misrepresentation as a defense]." Omitting [failure to disclose material facts that significantly impact the financial viability of the business] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of unfairly binding a party to a contract based on incomplete and misleading financial information, thereby causing significant financial harm to the party who relied on the misrepresentation]. Indeed, the opinion in HCA 846/2012 explicitly states that the necessity of rescission was crucial to their decision, as it prevented parties from easily escaping their contractual obligations without sufficient justification.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA 846/2012 was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of parties easily escaping their contractual obligations without sufficient justification, thereby upholding contractual certainty and fairness. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because the non-disclosure of the financial downturn due to the pandemic is a material fact that significantly affects the value and profitability of the business. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—preventing unjustified rescission of contracts—is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the focus should be on ensuring that Cissy is not unfairly bound by a contract based on incomplete and misleading financial information, which directly impacts the fairness and integrity of the contractual agreement.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the explicit step of rescission or election to rescind, which was present in the precedent case HCA 846/2012 BETWEEN INDIAN OVERSEAS BANK Plaintiff and SEABULK SYSTEMS INC. 1st Defendant RAMESH VANGAL 2nd Defendant SIDNEY SRIDHAR 3rd Defendant, requiring this factor for all similar cases of misrepresentation and failure to disclose material facts would lead to the undesirable consequence of unfairly binding parties to contracts based on incomplete and misleading information. Conversely, not requiring the explicit step of rescission or election to rescind would allow for a more equitable outcome, ensuring that parties who have been misled by material misrepresentations are not unfairly bound by such contracts. This better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and justice in contract law, which aim to protect parties from being unfairly disadvantaged by deceit or significant omissions.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the explicit step of rescission or election to rescind, which was present in HCA 846/2012, we have the additional factor of Peter's failure to disclose the likely lack of profit for the current financial year due to the pandemic. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of misrepresentation and reliance on those misrepresentations, serves a similar function to the rescission requirement in the precedent case. Given the presence of this significant non-disclosure, we submit that the reasoning in HCA 846/2012 still applies, as the positive effects on fairness and contractual integrity would still outweigh any potential negative consequences. This ensures that Cissy is not unfairly bound by a contract based on incomplete and misleading financial information, thereby upholding the principles of fairness and justice in contract law.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA 846/2012 BETWEEN INDIAN OVERSEAS BANK Plaintiff and SEABULK SYSTEMS INC. 1st Defendant RAMESH VANGAL 2nd Defendant SIDNEY SRIDHAR 3rd Defendant, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of misrepresentation, reliance on those misrepresentations, and the duty to disclose material facts. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the non-disclosure of the financial downturn due to the pandemic, which directly impacts the financial viability of the business Cissy is acquiring.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case—that misrepresentation must be proven to have induced the contract and that the contract must be rescinded or the party must elect to rescind before raising misrepresentation as a defense—finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the unique circumstances of the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the necessity of rescission to uphold contractual certainty and fairness (as argued in the precedent) and the need to protect parties from being unfairly bound by contracts based on incomplete and misleading financial information (as argued in the current case).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, justice, and the integrity of contractual agreements, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Cissy should be entitled to rescind the contract based on the misrepresentations made by Peter. This decision is justified because the non-disclosure of the financial downturn due to the pandemic is a material fact that significantly affects the value and profitability of the business, which Cissy relied upon when deciding to purchase Island Ice.

Therefore, Cissy should consider rescinding the contract and seeking damages for any losses incurred. This approach ensures that she is not unfairly bound by a contract based on incomplete and misleading financial information, thereby upholding the principles of fairness and justice in contract law.


# Contract Law: Whether Cissy can seek specific performance to compel Peter to repair or replace the lorry and ice-making machines

## Deductive reasoning: legislation

### Relevant law:

Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 54

### Major Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 54

   Conditions:
   - There is an action for breach of contract to deliver specific or ascertained goods.
   - The plaintiff applies for specific performance before judgment.

   Consequences:
   - The court may direct that the contract shall be performed specifically, without giving the defendant the option of retaining the goods on payment of damages.

   Exceptions:
   - The judgment may be unconditional, or on such terms and conditions as to damages, payment of the price, and otherwise, as to the court may seem just.

### Minor Premise:

1. Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 54:
- Cissy has entered into a contract with Peter for the acquisition of Island Ice, which includes specific goods (ice-making machines and lorries).
- The ice-making machines and one of the lorries have become non-functional before the transfer of possession.
- Cissy could argue that there is a breach of contract to deliver these specific goods in working condition.
- If Cissy applies for specific performance before judgment, the court may direct that Peter must repair or replace the lorry and ice-making machines specifically.
- However, the court has the discretion to make the judgment unconditional or impose terms and conditions as to damages, payment of the price, and otherwise, as it deems just.

### Conclusion:

Sale of Goods Ordinance Cap. 26 Section 54 applies. Cissy can seek specific performance to compel Peter to repair or replace the lorry and ice-making machines. However, the court has the discretion to impose terms and conditions as it deems just, which may include damages or other remedies.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD)

In the case of ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD [2023] HKCFI 3062; HCA 654/2023 (precedent p), the court ruled that the defendant had affirmed the contract by conduct and correspondence, and therefore, could no longer invoke rescission as a remedy. The court found that the defendant's actions were inconsistent with the reservation of the right to rescind, and thus, the plaintiffs were entitled to have the tax retention sum released to them.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Affirmation of Contract by Conduct**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (Precedent):** The defendant's assumption of control over the process of negotiating/liaising with the District Lands Office concerning the revised Short Term Tenancy (STT) was consistent with affirming the contract.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (Current Case):** Cissy's continued negotiations and actions regarding the acquisition of Island Ice, despite being aware of the issues with the lorries and ice-making machines, could be seen as affirming the contract.

- **Legal Concept 2: Misrepresentation and Breach of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (Precedent):** The defendant was aware of the misrepresentations and breaches but chose to pursue remedies for breach of the SPA rather than rescission.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (Current Case):** Cissy was informed of the misrepresentations regarding the lorries and ice-making machines but proceeded with the acquisition and could seek remedies for breach of contract.

- **Legal Concept 3: Inconsistent Remedies**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (Precedent):** The defendant's claim for "colossal damages" was inconsistent with the remedy of rescission.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (Current Case):** Cissy's potential claim for damages due to the malfunctioning lorry and ice-making machines would be inconsistent with seeking rescission of the contract.

- **Legal Concept 4: Timeliness of Rescission**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (Precedent):** The court found that the defendant's delay in mentioning rescission until much later was too late, as the contract had already been affirmed.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (Current Case):** Cissy's awareness of the issues with the lorries and ice-making machines before taking possession of the business could affect the timeliness of any attempt to rescind the contract.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of a party's conduct and correspondence being inconsistent with the reservation of the right to rescind, the court should decide that the contract has been affirmed and rescission is no longer available. This rule was justified in ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD because the positive effects (E+) of ensuring contractual certainty and preventing parties from oscillating between inconsistent remedies outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially limiting the remedies available to a party who has been misled. 

In the current case, Cissy's continued actions and negotiations regarding the acquisition of Island Ice, despite being aware of the issues, could be seen as affirming the contract. Therefore, she may not be able to seek rescission but could pursue remedies for breach of contract, such as damages for the malfunctioning lorry and ice-making machines.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Affirmation of Contract by Conduct**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (Precedent):** The defendant's assumption of control over the process of negotiating/liaising with the District Lands Office concerning the revised Short Term Tenancy (STT) was consistent with affirming the contract.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (Current Case):** Cissy's continued negotiations and actions regarding the acquisition of Island Ice, despite being aware of the issues with the lorries and ice-making machines, could be seen as affirming the contract.

- **Legal Concept 2: Misrepresentation and Breach of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (Precedent):** The defendant was aware of the misrepresentations and breaches but chose to pursue remedies for breach of the SPA rather than rescission.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (Current Case):** Cissy was informed of the misrepresentations regarding the lorries and ice-making machines but proceeded with the acquisition and could seek remedies for breach of contract.

- **Legal Concept 3: Inconsistent Remedies**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (Precedent):** The defendant's claim for "colossal damages" was inconsistent with the remedy of rescission.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (Current Case):** Cissy's potential claim for damages due to the malfunctioning lorry and ice-making machines would be inconsistent with seeking rescission of the contract.

- **Legal Concept 4: Timeliness of Rescission**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (Precedent):** The court found that the defendant's delay in mentioning rescission until much later was too late, as the contract had already been affirmed.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (Current Case):** Cissy's awareness of the issues with the lorries and ice-making machines before taking possession of the business could affect the timeliness of any attempt to rescind the contract.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Ensuring Contractual Certainty:** By affirming the contract through conduct, Cissy's actions would provide clarity and stability in commercial transactions, ensuring that parties cannot oscillate between inconsistent remedies.
2. **Preventing Inconsistent Remedies:** Allowing Cissy to seek both damages and rescission would be logically inconsistent and could lead to double recovery, which the law aims to prevent.
3. **Encouraging Diligence:** This outcome would encourage parties to promptly address any issues and make informed decisions about their contractual rights and remedies, promoting diligence and responsibility in commercial dealings.

Therefore, Cissy should not be able to seek rescission but could pursue remedies for breach of contract, such as damages for the malfunctioning lorry and ice-making machines.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the defendant's assumption of control over the process of negotiating/liaising with the District Lands Office concerning the revised Short Term Tenancy (STT). This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as ensuring contractual certainty and preventing parties from oscillating between inconsistent remedies, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it demonstrated the defendant's clear intention to affirm the contract. However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as Cissy did not take any similar affirmative actions that would unequivocally indicate her intention to affirm the contract despite being aware of the issues with the lorries and ice-making machines.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD. This factor is the significant misrepresentations made by Peter regarding the state of the lorries and the ice-making machines, as well as the financial health of the company. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because the misrepresentations directly impact the value and functionality of the business Cissy was acquiring. Due to these misrepresentations, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as unfairly binding Cissy to a contract based on false premises, than positive ones, unlike in ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD. This is because the precedent case did not involve such significant misrepresentations that would justify rescission of the contract.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD should be stated as: "When both [affirmation of contract by conduct] and [absence of significant misrepresentations] are present, the court should decide [that the contract has been affirmed and rescission is no longer available]." Omitting [absence of significant misrepresentations] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of unfairly binding a party to a contract based on false premises]. Indeed, the opinion in ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD explicitly states that the defendant's conduct and correspondence were inconsistent with the reservation of the right to rescind, which was crucial to their decision. However, the case did not involve significant misrepresentations that would justify rescission of the contract.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of parties oscillating between inconsistent remedies, thereby ensuring contractual certainty and stability. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this specific undesirable consequence occurring because the significant misrepresentations made by Peter regarding the state of the lorries and the ice-making machines, as well as the financial health of the company, directly impact the value and functionality of the business Cissy was acquiring. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Instead, the presence of significant misrepresentations justifies allowing Cissy to seek rescission of the contract to prevent her from being unfairly bound to a contract based on false premises.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of the defendant's assumption of control over the process of negotiating/liaising with the District Lands Office concerning the revised Short Term Tenancy (STT), which was present in the precedent case ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD, requiring this factor for all similar cases of affirmation of contract by conduct would lead to the undesirable consequence of unfairly binding parties to contracts despite significant misrepresentations. Conversely, not requiring this factor would allow for a more equitable outcome, which better aligns with the underlying principles of contract law, such as fairness and the prevention of unjust enrichment. This approach ensures that parties are not unfairly held to contracts based on false premises, thereby promoting justice and fairness in commercial transactions.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of the defendant's assumption of control over the process of negotiating/liaising with the District Lands Office concerning the revised Short Term Tenancy (STT), which was present in ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD, we have the additional factor of significant misrepresentations made by Peter regarding the state of the lorries and the ice-making machines, as well as the financial health of the company. This factor of significant misrepresentations, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of Cissy's continued actions and negotiations regarding the acquisition of Island Ice, serves a similar function to the assumption of control in the precedent case. Given the presence of significant misrepresentations, we submit that the reasoning in ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD still applies, as the positive effects on legal values such as fairness and the prevention of unjust enrichment would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the affirmation of the contract by conduct and the potential inconsistency of remedies. However, it also differs significantly in the presence of substantial misrepresentations made by Peter regarding the state of the lorries, the ice-making machines, and the financial health of the company.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case, which suggests that a party's conduct and correspondence inconsistent with the reservation of the right to rescind should lead to the conclusion that the contract has been affirmed and rescission is no longer available, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the significant misrepresentations in the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that Cissy's continued actions and negotiations could be seen as affirming the contract (as argued in the initial analogy) and the counterargument that significant misrepresentations justify allowing rescission to prevent unfairly binding a party to a contract based on false premises.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, the prevention of unjust enrichment, and the need for contractual certainty, we conclude that Cissy should be allowed to seek rescission of the contract due to the significant misrepresentations made by Peter. This decision aligns with the legal principle that a contract based on false premises should not bind a party, ensuring justice and legal consistency.

Therefore, Cissy has the legal option to seek rescission of the contract for the acquisition of Island Ice, given the substantial misrepresentations regarding the lorries, the ice-making machines, and the financial health of the company. If rescission is not pursued or granted, she may alternatively seek damages for breach of contract. This conclusion is reached by balancing the need for fairness and the prevention of unjust enrichment against the importance of contractual certainty.

### Relevant law:

Kensland Realty Limited v Whale View Investment Limited

### Major Premise:

1. Kensland Realty Limited v Whale View Investment Limited

   Conditions:
   - A contractual party is in breach of an obligation owed to the other party.
   - The breach is the direct cause of the other party's failure to meet a stipulated deadline or condition.
   - The contract-breaker seeks to take advantage of the consequences of their own breach.

   Consequences:
   - The contract-breaker is prevented from asserting rights or claiming benefits which arise in consequence of their breach.

   Exceptions:
   - The breach is not causally related to the failure to meet the condition.
   - The contract contains clear express provisions to the contrary.

### Minor Premise:

1. Kensland Realty Limited v Whale View Investment Limited:

   - Peter Pang is in breach of an obligation owed to Cissy Cheung regarding the condition of the ice-making machines and the lorries.
   - The malfunction of the ice-making machines and the destruction of the lorry are direct causes of Cissy's inability to take possession of the business as stipulated in the contract.
   - Peter seeks to take advantage of the consequences of his own breach by enforcing the contract despite the significant issues with the machines and lorries.
   - The breach is causally related to the failure to meet the condition of delivering a fully operational business.
   - There are no clear express provisions in the contract that would allow Peter to avoid liability for these breaches.

### Conclusion:

Kensland Realty Limited v Whale View Investment Limited applies, and Peter Pang is prevented from asserting rights or claiming benefits which arise in consequence of his breach. Cissy Cheung can terminate the contract due to the breach of terms regarding the ice-making machines and lorries.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD)

In the case of ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD [2023] HKCFI 3062; HCA 654/2023 (precedent p), the court ruled that the defendant had affirmed the contract by conduct and correspondence, and therefore, could not invoke rescission as a remedy. The court found that the defendant's actions were consistent with affirming the contract, such as taking over negotiations and making claims for damages, which were inconsistent with the right to rescind.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts

Both in ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Affirmation of Contract by Conduct**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (p)**: The defendant took over negotiations with the District Lands Office and made claims for damages, which were actions consistent with affirming the contract.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (c)**: Cissy continued with the acquisition process despite the issues with the lorries and ice-making machines, which could be seen as affirming the contract.

- **Legal Concept 2: Misrepresentation**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (p)**: The defendant claimed misrepresentation regarding the title issues but continued to act in a manner consistent with the contract.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (c)**: Peter made representations about the reliability of the lorries and the profitability of the business, which were later found to be misleading.

- **Legal Concept 3: Right to Rescind**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (p)**: The defendant attempted to claim rescission after a significant period and after taking actions that affirmed the contract.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (c)**: Cissy may seek to rescind the contract due to the misrepresentations and the subsequent issues with the business assets.

- **Legal Concept 4: Timing of Rescission**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (p)**: The court found that the defendant's delay and actions inconsistent with rescission barred the right to rescind.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (c)**: Cissy discovered the issues with the lorries and ice-making machines shortly before taking possession, raising the question of whether she acted promptly enough to rescind.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD)

This suggests a general rule that when we see a fact pattern where a party continues to act in a manner consistent with the contract despite being aware of issues that could justify rescission, the court should decide that the party has affirmed the contract and cannot later seek rescission. This rule was justified in ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD because the defendant's actions, such as taking over negotiations and making claims for damages, were inconsistent with the right to rescind and demonstrated an intention to continue with the contract. The positive effects (E+) of this outcome include promoting certainty and stability in contractual relationships, ensuring that parties cannot opportunistically claim rescission after benefiting from the contract, and encouraging prompt action when issues arise. The negative effects (E-) are minimal in comparison, as parties are still able to seek damages for breaches or misrepresentations without disrupting the contractual framework.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Affirmation of Contract by Conduct**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (p)**: The defendant took over negotiations with the District Lands Office and made claims for damages, which were actions consistent with affirming the contract.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (c)**: Cissy continued with the acquisition process despite the issues with the lorries and ice-making machines, which could be seen as affirming the contract.

- **Legal Concept 2: Misrepresentation**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (p)**: The defendant claimed misrepresentation regarding the title issues but continued to act in a manner consistent with the contract.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (c)**: Peter made representations about the reliability of the lorries and the profitability of the business, which were later found to be misleading.

- **Legal Concept 3: Right to Rescind**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (p)**: The defendant attempted to claim rescission after a significant period and after taking actions that affirmed the contract.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (c)**: Cissy may seek to rescind the contract due to the misrepresentations and the subsequent issues with the business assets.

- **Legal Concept 4: Timing of Rescission**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (p)**: The court found that the defendant's delay and actions inconsistent with rescission barred the right to rescind.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (c)**: Cissy discovered the issues with the lorries and ice-making machines shortly before taking possession, raising the question of whether she acted promptly enough to rescind.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome as in ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD. This decision would be justified because, as in the precedent case, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Promoting Certainty and Stability in Contractual Relationships**: By affirming that Cissy's actions are consistent with affirming the contract, the court would reinforce the principle that parties must act promptly and consistently if they wish to rescind a contract. This promotes certainty and stability in contractual relationships, ensuring that parties cannot opportunistically claim rescission after benefiting from the contract.

2. **Encouraging Prompt Action**: The decision would encourage parties to act promptly when issues arise, ensuring that any claims for rescission are made in a timely manner. This helps to avoid prolonged uncertainty and potential disputes.

3. **Preventing Opportunistic Behavior**: By ruling that Cissy has affirmed the contract by her conduct, the court would prevent her from opportunistically seeking rescission after having continued with the acquisition process despite being aware of the issues. This aligns with the principle of good faith in contractual dealings.

4. **Consistency in Legal Application**: Applying the same rule to similar fact patterns ensures consistency in the application of the law, which is a fundamental principle of the common law system. This consistency helps to build a predictable legal environment for businesses and individuals.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome. This decision would be justified because, as in ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD, it would have the positive effects of promoting certainty, encouraging prompt action, preventing opportunistic behavior, and ensuring consistency in the application of the law.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the defendant's assumption of control over the process of negotiating/liaising with the District Lands Office (DLO) concerning the revised Short Term Tenancy (STT). This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling, such as promoting certainty and stability in contractual relationships, outweighed any potential drawbacks because it demonstrated the defendant's clear intention to affirm the contract by their conduct. However, in our current case, this crucial factor of assuming control over a specific process (like the DLO negotiations) is notably absent. Cissy did not take any comparable actions that would unequivocally indicate her intention to affirm the contract despite the issues with the lorries and ice-making machines.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD. This factor is the timing and immediacy of the discovery of the issues with the business assets. Cissy discovered the problems with the lorries and ice-making machines just days before taking physical possession of the business, which significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern. Due to this immediacy, applying the same outcome in our case would have more negative consequences, such as unfairly binding Cissy to a contract under conditions she was not aware of until the last moment, unlike in ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD, where the defendant had ample time and opportunity to act on the misrepresentations but chose to continue with the contract. This distinction suggests that Cissy should be allowed to seek rescission or other remedies due to the recent and sudden discovery of the issues, which were not apparent at the time of contract formation.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD should be stated as: "When both the party's conduct is consistent with affirming the contract (i*) and the party has taken over a specific process or negotiation related to the contract (m), the court should decide that the party has affirmed the contract and cannot seek rescission (o)." Omitting the specific process or negotiation (m) from this rule could lead to the undesirable consequence (q) of unfairly binding parties to contracts under conditions they were not fully aware of or had no opportunity to address promptly. Indeed, the opinion in ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD explicitly states that the defendant's assumption of control over the process of negotiating/liaising with the District Lands Office was crucial to their decision, as it demonstrated a clear intention to affirm the contract.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence (u) of parties opportunistically seeking rescission after having taken actions that affirm the contract, thereby promoting certainty and stability in contractual relationships. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring because Cissy discovered the issues with the lorries and ice-making machines just days before taking physical possession of the business. This timing significantly alters the situation, as Cissy did not have the opportunity to take actions that would unequivocally indicate her intention to affirm the contract. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation. Cissy should be allowed to seek rescission or other remedies due to the recent and sudden discovery of the issues, which were not apparent at the time of contract formation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of assuming control over a specific process or negotiation related to the contract (m), which was present in the precedent case ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD, requiring this factor for all similar cases of affirmation of contract by conduct (i*) would lead to the undesirable consequence of unfairly binding parties to contracts under conditions they were not fully aware of or had no opportunity to address promptly. Conversely, not requiring the assumption of control over a specific process or negotiation (m) would allow for a more equitable outcome, which better aligns with the underlying principles of fairness and good faith in contractual dealings. This approach ensures that parties are not penalized for issues that arise suddenly and without their prior knowledge, thereby promoting justice and fairness in contract law.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of assuming control over a specific process or negotiation related to the contract (m), which was present in ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD, we have the additional factor of the immediacy and timing of the discovery of the issues with the business assets (n). This factor (n), when considered alongside the shared circumstances of misrepresentation and the right to rescind (i*), serves a similar function to (m) in the precedent case. Given the presence of (n), we submit that the reasoning in ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD still applies, as the positive effects on promoting fairness and good faith in contractual dealings would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. The immediacy of the discovery of the issues just before taking possession justifies allowing Cissy to seek rescission or other remedies, ensuring that she is not unfairly bound to a contract under unforeseen and detrimental conditions.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to ROBERT JOHN FRANCIS BROTHERS AND ANOTHER v. NEW RUI INTERNATIONAL CO LTD, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the issues of misrepresentation and the right to rescind, as well as the concept of affirmation of the contract by conduct. However, it also differs significantly in the immediacy and timing of the discovery of the issues with the business assets, which was not a factor in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule from the precedent case, which suggests that a party's conduct consistent with affirming the contract and taking over a specific process or negotiation related to the contract bars the right to rescind, finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the unique circumstances of the current case.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that Cissy's actions could be seen as affirming the contract (as argued in the initial analogy) and the counterargument that the immediacy of the discovery of the issues just before taking possession justifies allowing her to seek rescission (as argued in the rebuttal).

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, good faith in contractual dealings, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Cissy should be allowed to seek rescission or other remedies due to the recent and sudden discovery of the issues, which were not apparent at the time of contract formation. This decision aligns with the principles of justice and legal consistency, ensuring that parties are not unfairly bound to contracts under unforeseen and detrimental conditions.

Therefore, Cissy has valid legal grounds to seek rescission of the contract due to the misrepresentations and the subsequent issues with the business assets, given the immediacy of the discovery and the lack of opportunity to address these issues promptly. This outcome promotes fairness and good faith in contractual dealings, ensuring that parties act promptly and consistently when issues arise.

- Peter made several misrepresentations to Cissy before the contract was made:
  - The ice-making machines had been recently upgraded and only required a tune-up every six months.
  - The lorries were "seasoned and trusty" and "110% reliable."
  - The company had a loyal customer base and showed a profit of $6 million for the financial year ending 31 March 2020, without disclosing the impact of the pandemic on current profits.
- Cissy has suffered loss as a result of these misrepresentations:
  - One of the lorries was destroyed, and the ice-making machines require extensive repairs, leading to significant revenue loss.
- The term in the contract that could exclude or restrict Peter's liability for these misrepresentations shall be of no effect unless it satisfies the requirement of reasonableness.
- It is for Peter to show that the term satisfies the requirement of reasonableness.

### Conclusion:

Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 4 applies, and the term in the contract that could exclude or restrict Peter's liability for misrepresentations shall be of no effect unless Peter can show that it satisfies the requirement of reasonableness. Therefore, Cissy may have legal remedies available to her, including rescission of the contract and/or damages for the losses suffered due to Peter's misrepresentations.

## Deductive Reasoning: cfa

### Relevant law:

Polyset Limited v Panhandat Limited

### Major Premise:

1. Polyset Limited v Panhandat Limited

   Conditions:
   - The forfeiture clause is in truth a liquidated damages clause.
   - The amount stipulated is not a genuine pre-estimate of loss.
   - The deposit is extravagant and excessive.

   Consequences:
   - The forfeiture of the deposit may be considered a penalty.
   - The court may intervene to prevent the forfeiture.

   Exceptions:
   - The deposit is reasonable and serves as a true deposit, namely, a guarantee of performance as well as part payment on account.

### Minor Premise:

1. Polyset Limited v Panhandat Limited:
- Cissy has entered into a contract with Peter for the acquisition of Island Ice.
- The contract includes a clause stating, "The full purchase price shall include the assets itemized in the inventory list attached hereto," which includes the ice-making machines and the two lorries.
- One of the lorries was destroyed, and the ice-making machines are non-functional, which significantly affects the value of the business.
- The initial instalment of $4 million paid by Cissy can be considered a deposit.
- The forfeiture of this deposit could be seen as a penalty if the amount is not a genuine pre-estimate of loss and is extravagant and excessive.
- The deposit might be considered extravagant and excessive given the significant issues with the assets that were not disclosed to Cissy.
- However, if the deposit is reasonable and serves as a true deposit, namely, a guarantee of performance as well as part payment on account, the court may not intervene.

### Conclusion:

The clause "The full purchase price shall include the assets itemized in the inventory list attached hereto" affects Cissy's remedies. Given the significant issues with the assets (the destroyed lorry and non-functional ice-making machines), the forfeiture of the deposit may be considered a penalty. Therefore, the court may intervene to prevent the forfeiture of the deposit, unless it is deemed reasonable and serves as a true deposit.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG v MING YIU HENG)
In the case of HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG v MING YIU HENG (precedent p), the plaintiff (Ngai Keung) claimed the outstanding balance of the purchase price for shares sold to the defendant (Ming Yiu Heng) under an equity transfer agreement (ETA). The defendant counterclaimed for rescission of the ETA and damages due to misrepresentations made by the plaintiff. The court ruled that the equitable remedy of rescission was available to the defendant because the plaintiff had made false representations that induced the defendant to enter into the contract.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG v MING YIU HENG and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Misrepresentation**: In both cases, the plaintiffs made false statements that induced the defendants to enter into the contracts.
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA 1584/2010, the plaintiff made false representations about the financial status and future prospects of the company. In the current case, Peter made false representations about the reliability of the lorries and the profitability of the business.
  
- **Reliance on Representations**: The defendants in both cases relied on these false representations when deciding to enter into the contracts.
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA 1584/2010, the defendant relied on the representations about the company's financial health and employment prospects. In the current case, Cissy relied on the representations about the ice-making machines, the lorries, and the company's profitability.
  
- **Rescission as a Remedy**: The court in HCA 1584/2010 allowed rescission of the contract due to the misrepresentations.
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA 1584/2010, the court found that the misrepresentations were material and induced the defendant to enter into the contract, justifying rescission. In the current case, the misrepresentations about the lorries and the ice-making machines, as well as the omission about the company's current financial status, are material and induced Cissy to enter into the contract.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG v MING YIU HENG)
This suggests a general rule that when we see the fact pattern of material misrepresentations that induce a party to enter into a contract, the court should decide that rescission is an appropriate remedy. This rule was justified in HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG v MING YIU HENG because the positive effects (E+) of allowing rescission—such as upholding the integrity of contractual agreements and protecting parties from fraudulent or misleading conduct—outweigh the negative effects (E-) of potentially disrupting contractual stability.

Applying this rule to the current case, Cissy should be entitled to rescind the contract for the acquisition of Island Ice due to the material misrepresentations made by Peter regarding the reliability of the lorries, the condition of the ice-making machines, and the omission of the company's current financial difficulties. This would allow Cissy to avoid the contract and seek restitution for any payments made, thereby protecting her from the adverse consequences of relying on false information.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG v MING YIU HENG) are present:

- **Misrepresentation**: Peter made false statements about the reliability of the lorries and the condition of the ice-making machines, as well as an omission regarding the company's current financial difficulties.
  - **Fact Pattern 1**: In HCA 1584/2010, the plaintiff made false representations about the financial status and future prospects of the company. In the current case, Peter made false representations about the reliability of the lorries and the profitability of the business.

- **Reliance on Representations**: Cissy relied on these false representations when deciding to enter into the contract.
  - **Fact Pattern 2**: In HCA 1584/2010, the defendant relied on the representations about the company's financial health and employment prospects. In the current case, Cissy relied on the representations about the ice-making machines, the lorries, and the company's profitability.

- **Rescission as a Remedy**: The court in HCA 1584/2010 allowed rescission of the contract due to the misrepresentations.
  - **Fact Pattern 3**: In HCA 1584/2010, the court found that the misrepresentations were material and induced the defendant to enter into the contract, justifying rescission. In the current case, the misrepresentations about the lorries and the ice-making machines, as well as the omission about the company's current financial status, are material and induced Cissy to enter into the contract.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome of allowing rescission of the contract. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG v MING YIU HENG, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Upholding the Integrity of Contractual Agreements**: Allowing rescission in cases of material misrepresentation ensures that parties are held accountable for the accuracy of their statements, thereby maintaining the integrity of contractual agreements.

2. **Protecting Parties from Fraudulent or Misleading Conduct**: By permitting rescission, the court protects parties from entering into contracts based on false or misleading information, which is crucial for fair and honest commercial practices.

3. **Promoting Commercial Morality**: This decision reinforces the principle that parties should not benefit from their own wrongs. It discourages misrepresentation and promotes ethical behavior in business transactions.

4. **Public Policy Considerations**: Allowing rescission aligns with public policy by ensuring that contracts are based on true and accurate representations, thereby fostering trust and reliability in commercial dealings.

Therefore, given the presence of the same crucial fact patterns, the court should allow Cissy to rescind the contract for the acquisition of Island Ice. This would protect her from the adverse consequences of relying on false information and uphold the principles of fairness and integrity in contractual relationships.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG v MING YIU HENG, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the misrepresentations made by the plaintiff were directly related to the core aspects of the business being sold, such as the financial health and future prospects of the company. This factor was key in ensuring that the benefits of the ruling—upholding the integrity of contractual agreements and protecting parties from fraudulent or misleading conduct—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it directly impacted the defendant's decision to enter into the contract.

However, in our current case, this crucial factor is notably absent as the misrepresentations made by Peter about the reliability of the lorries and the condition of the ice-making machines, while significant, do not directly relate to the core financial health or future prospects of Island Ice. Instead, they pertain to specific assets within the business. Additionally, the omission regarding the company's current financial difficulties due to the pandemic, while material, is a broader market condition that may not have been as directly controllable by Peter as the misrepresentations in the precedent case.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG v MING YIU HENG. This factor is the clause in the contract stating, "The full purchase price shall include the assets itemized in the inventory list attached hereto." This clause significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern because it explicitly includes the ice-making machines and the lorries as part of the agreed-upon assets in the sale.

Due to this clause, applying the same outcome of rescission in our case would have more negative consequences such as undermining the contractual certainty and stability that such specific clauses are meant to provide. Unlike in HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG v MING YIU HENG, where the misrepresentations were about the overall business prospects, the current case involves specific assets that were explicitly listed and agreed upon in the contract. This specificity in the contract suggests that Cissy had an opportunity to inspect and verify these assets, and her decision not to do so could be seen as a failure to exercise due diligence.

Therefore, the presence of this clause in the current case means that rescission might not be the most appropriate remedy, as it would conflict with the contractual terms that both parties agreed upon. Instead, Cissy might be better advised to seek damages for the specific misrepresentations about the assets, rather than rescission of the entire contract. This approach would balance the need to uphold contractual agreements with the need to address the misrepresentations made by Peter.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence

We propose that the correct rule from HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG v MING YIU HENG should be stated as: "When both [material misrepresentation inducing a party to enter into a contract] and [a specific clause in the contract explicitly listing the assets] are present, the court should decide [to award damages rather than rescission]." Omitting [the specific clause in the contract explicitly listing the assets] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of undermining contractual certainty and stability]. Indeed, the opinion in HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG v MING YIU HENG did not involve a specific clause listing the assets, which was crucial to their decision to allow rescission. Including the specific clause in the rule prevents the undesirable outcome of parties being able to rescind contracts despite having agreed to specific terms and conditions, thereby maintaining the integrity and reliability of contractual agreements.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence

The rule established in HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG v MING YIU HENG was clearly designed to prevent the undesirable consequence of parties being misled into contracts based on false representations, thereby protecting them from fraudulent or misleading conduct. However, in our current case, there's no risk of this undesirable consequence occurring to the same extent because the contract explicitly included a clause listing the assets, which provided Cissy with an opportunity to inspect and verify these assets. Therefore, applying the precedent's rule of allowing rescission here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves—protecting parties from entering into contracts based on false representations—is not as relevant to our situation where specific contractual terms were agreed upon. Instead, awarding damages for the misrepresentations would better balance the need to uphold contractual agreements with addressing the misrepresentations made by Peter.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the specific factor of misrepresentations directly related to the core financial health or future prospects of the business, which was present in the precedent case HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG v MING YIU HENG, requiring this factor for all similar cases of material misrepresentation would lead to the undesirable consequence of limiting the scope of protection against misrepresentations to only those that affect the overall financial health of a business. This would leave parties vulnerable to significant misrepresentations about specific, yet crucial, assets that can materially affect the value and operation of the business. Conversely, not requiring this factor would allow for a broader application of the principle that parties should not benefit from their own wrongs, thereby better aligning with the underlying principles of fairness and integrity in contractual relationships.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of misrepresentations directly related to the core financial health or future prospects of the business, which was present in HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG v MING YIU HENG, we have the additional factor of a specific clause in the contract explicitly listing the assets. This clause, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of material misrepresentation inducing a party to enter into a contract, serves a similar function to the misrepresentations about the overall business prospects in the precedent case. Given the presence of this clause, we submit that the reasoning in HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG v MING YIU HENG still applies, as the positive effects on upholding the integrity of contractual agreements and protecting parties from fraudulent or misleading conduct would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case. Therefore, Cissy should be entitled to seek damages for the specific misrepresentations about the assets, rather than rescission of the entire contract, thereby balancing the need to uphold contractual agreements with addressing the misrepresentations made by Peter.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA 1584/2010 NGAI KEUNG v MING YIU HENG, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of material misrepresentations that induced a party to enter into a contract and the reliance on these misrepresentations. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the presence of a specific clause in the contract explicitly listing the assets, which was not present in the precedent case.

The proposed legal rule that rescission is an appropriate remedy when material misrepresentations induce a party to enter into a contract finds support in both cases. However, its broader implications must be considered, especially in light of the specific clause in the current case that explicitly lists the assets. This clause suggests that Cissy had an opportunity to inspect and verify these assets, and her decision not to do so could be seen as a failure to exercise due diligence.

We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the strong point that allowing rescission would uphold the integrity of contractual agreements and protect parties from fraudulent or misleading conduct, as well as the counterargument that rescission might not be appropriate due to the specific contractual terms agreed upon.

Considering the underlying legal principles of fairness, integrity in contractual relationships, and the need to balance contractual certainty with protection against misrepresentation, we conclude that Cissy should be entitled to seek damages for the specific misrepresentations about the assets, rather than rescission of the entire contract. This approach would better balance the need to uphold contractual agreements with addressing the misrepresentations made by Peter, thereby serving justice and legal consistency.

Therefore, the final decision is that Cissy should pursue damages for the misrepresentations regarding the ice-making machines and the lorries, as well as the omission about the company's current financial status, rather than seeking rescission of the entire contract. This decision aligns with legal precedent while also ensuring that the contractual terms are respected and that Cissy is compensated for the misrepresentations that induced her to enter into the contract.

### Minor Premise:

1. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 2:
- Cissy has entered into a contract with Peter after a misrepresentation has been made to her.
- The misrepresentation has become a term of the contract (e.g., the reliability of the lorries and the upgraded ice-making machines).
- The contract has been performed (Cissy has paid part of the purchase price and is about to take possession).
- Cissy would be entitled to rescind the contract without alleging fraud.
- Therefore, Cissy is entitled to rescind the contract, subject to the provisions of the Ordinance.

2. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 1:
- Cissy has entered into a contract with Peter after a misrepresentation.
- The misrepresentation was made to her by Peter.
- Cissy has suffered loss as a result of the misrepresentation (e.g., the lorry's destruction and the ice-making machines' malfunction).
- If Peter had made the misrepresentation fraudulently, he would be liable to damages.
- Peter may argue that he had reasonable grounds to believe the facts represented were true and did believe them up to the time the contract was made.
- Therefore, this section may not apply if Peter can prove his belief was reasonable and genuine.

3. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 3 Subsection 2:
- Cissy has entered into a contract.
- She entered into the contract after a misrepresentation has been made to her.
- The misrepresentation was not made to her fraudulently.
- Cissy would be entitled, by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract.
- It is claimed in any proceedings arising out of the contract that the contract ought to be or has been rescinded.
- The court or arbitrator may consider it equitable to declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission, considering:
  * The nature of the misrepresentation (innocent but material).
  * The loss that would be caused by it if the contract were upheld (significant financial loss).
  * The loss that rescission would cause to Peter (loss of sale proceeds and future profits).
- Therefore, the court may declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission.

4. Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284 Section 4:
- The contract may contain terms excluding or restricting liability for misrepresentation.
- Such terms would be of no effect unless they satisfy the requirement of reasonableness.
- It is for Peter to show that any such term satisfies the requirement of reasonableness.
- Therefore, any exclusion or restriction clause in the contract may be ineffective unless proven reasonable.

### Conclusion:

Cissy has several legal options under the Misrepresentation Ordinance Cap. 284. She may be entitled to rescind the contract under Section 2. Alternatively, under Section 3 Subsection 2, the court may declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission, considering the nature of the misrepresentation and the losses involved. Any exclusion or restriction clauses in the contract may be ineffective unless proven reasonable under Section 4.

## Reasoning by analogy: cases

### Step 1: Outcome of Precedent (HCA 1617/2016)
In the case of HCA 1617/2016 BETWEEN FAR WEALTH LIMITED 1st Plaintiff SELECTED BRAND LIMITED 2nd Plaintiff and LO KI MOU 1st Defendant LO MUK WING 2nd Defendant (precedent p), the court dealt with two sets of proceedings involving the same parties and similar issues. The vendors (defendants in HCA 1617/2016) applied to strike out the purchasers' (plaintiffs in HCA 1617/2016) Statement of Claim on the grounds of abuse of process, arguing that the issues raised in HCA 1617/2016 were already covered in HCMP 6/2016. The court ruled that it was an abuse of process to have two sets of proceedings for the same issues and struck out HCA 1617/2016, allowing the purchasers to bring a counterclaim in HCMP 6/2016 instead.

### Step 2: Shared Legal Concepts
Both in HCA 1617/2016 and in our current case, we see the following legal concepts and fact patterns:

- **Legal Concept 1: Misrepresentation**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (HCA 1617/2016)**: The purchasers claimed fraudulent misrepresentation by the vendors regarding the authority to sign the Agreement.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (Current Case)**: Cissy may claim misrepresentation by Peter regarding the reliability of the lorries and the profitability of the business.

- **Legal Concept 2: Breach of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (HCA 1617/2016)**: The vendors sought declarations that they were discharged from further performance of the Agreement due to the purchasers' failure to complete the transaction.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (Current Case)**: Cissy may argue that Peter breached the contract by failing to disclose the true condition of the lorries and the financial state of the business.

- **Legal Concept 3: Remedies for Misrepresentation**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (HCA 1617/2016)**: The purchasers sought rescission of the Agreement and repayment of deposits based on fraudulent misrepresentation.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (Current Case)**: Cissy may seek rescission of the contract and recovery of the initial instalment paid, based on misrepresentation.

- **Legal Concept 4: Abuse of Process**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (HCA 1617/2016)**: The court found that having two sets of proceedings for the same issues was an abuse of process.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (Current Case)**: While not directly applicable, the principle of avoiding multiplicity of proceedings may guide the court in ensuring efficient resolution of disputes.

### Step 3: Extraction of Legal Rule from Precedent (HCA 1617/2016)
This suggests a general rule that when we see fact patterns involving misrepresentation and breach of contract, the court should decide in favor of remedies such as rescission and recovery of payments made. This rule was justified in HCA 1617/2016 because it prevented the unnecessary multiplication of actions, thereby promoting judicial efficiency and fairness between the parties.

In the current case, Cissy can argue that Peter's misrepresentations about the reliability of the lorries and the financial health of the business induced her to enter into the contract. Given the shared legal concepts and fact patterns, Cissy may seek rescission of the contract and recovery of the initial instalment paid, similar to the relief sought in HCA 1617/2016. The court should consider these remedies to ensure a just resolution of the dispute, consistent with the principles established in the precedent case.

### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Current Case

In the current case, the same legal concepts and fact patterns as the precedent (HCA 1617/2016) are present:

- **Legal Concept 1: Misrepresentation**
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (HCA 1617/2016)**: The purchasers claimed fraudulent misrepresentation by the vendors regarding the authority to sign the Agreement.
  - **Fact Pattern 1 (Current Case)**: Cissy may claim misrepresentation by Peter regarding the reliability of the lorries and the profitability of the business.

- **Legal Concept 2: Breach of Contract**
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (HCA 1617/2016)**: The vendors sought declarations that they were discharged from further performance of the Agreement due to the purchasers' failure to complete the transaction.
  - **Fact Pattern 2 (Current Case)**: Cissy may argue that Peter breached the contract by failing to disclose the true condition of the lorries and the financial state of the business.

- **Legal Concept 3: Remedies for Misrepresentation**
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (HCA 1617/2016)**: The purchasers sought rescission of the Agreement and repayment of deposits based on fraudulent misrepresentation.
  - **Fact Pattern 3 (Current Case)**: Cissy may seek rescission of the contract and recovery of the initial instalment paid, based on misrepresentation.

- **Legal Concept 4: Abuse of Process**
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (HCA 1617/2016)**: The court found that having two sets of proceedings for the same issues was an abuse of process.
  - **Fact Pattern 4 (Current Case)**: While not directly applicable, the principle of avoiding multiplicity of proceedings may guide the court in ensuring efficient resolution of disputes.

Given that our current case shares these crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome of allowing rescission of the contract and recovery of the initial instalment paid. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA 1617/2016, it would have the following positive effects:

1. **Promoting Judicial Efficiency**: By addressing the misrepresentation and breach of contract in a single proceeding, the court would avoid unnecessary multiplicity of actions, thereby saving judicial resources and reducing litigation costs for both parties.

2. **Ensuring Fairness**: Allowing Cissy to rescind the contract and recover her initial payment would place her in the position she would have been in had the misrepresentations not occurred. This aligns with the principle of fairness and ensures that Peter does not benefit from his misrepresentations.

3. **Upholding Contractual Integrity**: By addressing the misrepresentations and breaches, the court would reinforce the importance of honesty and full disclosure in contractual dealings, thereby upholding the integrity of commercial transactions.

4. **Consistency with Legal Precedents**: Following the principles established in HCA 1617/2016 ensures consistency in the application of the law, providing predictability and stability in legal outcomes.

Therefore, given that our current case shares the same crucial fact patterns, we submit that the court should reach the same outcome of allowing rescission of the contract and recovery of the initial instalment paid. This decision would be justified because, as in HCA 1617/2016, it would promote judicial efficiency, ensure fairness, uphold contractual integrity, and maintain consistency with legal precedents.

### Step 5: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Current Case
In the precedent case HCA 1617/2016, the court's decision was significantly influenced by the fact that the issues raised in the second set of proceedings (HCA 1617/2016) were already covered in the first set of proceedings (HCMP 6/2016). This overlap was key in ensuring that the benefits of striking out the second set of proceedings—such as judicial efficiency, cost savings, and avoiding multiplicity of actions—outweighed any potential drawbacks because it prevented the same issues from being litigated twice. However, in our current case, this crucial overlap of issues is notably absent as there is no indication that Cissy has initiated or is involved in any other proceedings related to the acquisition of Island Ice. Therefore, the argument of abuse of process due to multiplicity of actions does not apply here.

### Step 6: Distinction Due to Missing Feature in Precedent Case
Our current case involves an important factor that was not present in HCA 1617/2016: the significant and immediate operational failures of the business assets (the lorry bursting into flames and the ice-making machines grinding to a halt) just before the transfer of the business. This factor significantly alters the situation described by the shared fact pattern of misrepresentation and breach of contract. Due to these operational failures, applying the same outcome of allowing rescission of the contract and recovery of the initial instalment paid in our case would have more negative consequences, such as leaving Peter with a business that has suddenly become non-operational and potentially worthless, unlike in HCA 1617/2016 where the business assets were not in immediate jeopardy. This operational failure introduces a new dimension of urgency and potential financial ruin that was not present in the precedent case, thereby altering the balance of positive and negative effects.

### Step 7: Argument from Undesirable Consequence
We propose that the correct rule from HCA 1617/2016 should be stated as: "When both [misrepresentation and breach of contract] and [the absence of multiple proceedings] are present, the court should decide [to allow rescission of the contract and recovery of the initial instalment paid]." Omitting [the absence of multiple proceedings] from this rule could lead to [the undesirable consequence of judicial inefficiency and unfairness]. Indeed, the opinion in HCA 1617/2016 explicitly states that the decision to strike out the second set of proceedings was significantly influenced by the fact that the issues raised were already covered in the first set of proceedings, thereby preventing unnecessary multiplication of actions and promoting judicial efficiency.

### Step 8: Distinction from Non-occurring Undesirable Consequence
The rule established in HCA 1617/2016 was clearly designed to prevent [the undesirable consequence of judicial inefficiency and the unnecessary multiplication of actions]. However, in our current case, there's no risk of [judicial inefficiency and unnecessary multiplication of actions] occurring because Cissy has not initiated or is involved in any other proceedings related to the acquisition of Island Ice. Therefore, applying [the precedent's rule] here would be misguided, as the very purpose it serves is not relevant to our situation.

### Step 9: Downplaying Significance of Distinction
While it's true that our case lacks the factor of multiple proceedings, which was present in the precedent case HCA 1617/2016, requiring this factor for all similar cases of misrepresentation and breach of contract would lead to an undesirable consequence. Specifically, it would mean that parties could only seek remedies for misrepresentation and breach of contract if they were involved in multiple proceedings, which is an arbitrary and unnecessary restriction. Conversely, not requiring the factor of multiple proceedings would allow for a more straightforward and just resolution of disputes involving misrepresentation and breach of contract, which better aligns with the underlying principles of the law in this area, such as promoting fairness, judicial efficiency, and the integrity of contractual dealings.

### Step 10: Feature Substitution
Although our case lacks the factor of multiple proceedings, which was present in HCA 1617/2016, we have the additional factor of significant and immediate operational failures of the business assets. This factor, when considered alongside the shared circumstances of misrepresentation and breach of contract, serves a similar function to the factor of multiple proceedings in the precedent case. Given the presence of significant and immediate operational failures, we submit that the reasoning in HCA 1617/2016 still applies, as the positive effects on relevant legal values, such as ensuring fairness and upholding contractual integrity, would still outweigh any potential negative consequences, just as they did in the precedent case.

### Step 11: Conclusion

After careful consideration of all arguments presented, including the initial analogy to HCA 1617/2016, the distinctions raised, and the counterarguments offered, we make the following observations. The case shares key similarities with the precedent, such as the presence of misrepresentation and breach of contract. However, it also differs in significant ways, particularly the absence of multiple proceedings and the immediate operational failures of the business assets.

The proposed legal rule of allowing rescission of the contract and recovery of the initial instalment paid finds support in both cases, but its broader implications must be considered. We've weighed arguments from both sides, particularly the vendors' argument that multiple proceedings should be avoided to promote judicial efficiency and the purchasers' argument that they are not obliged to bring a counterclaim instead of a separate action.

Considering the underlying legal principles of promoting fairness, judicial efficiency, and the integrity of contractual dealings, and the potential impact on future cases, we conclude that Cissy should be allowed to seek rescission of the contract and recovery of the initial instalment paid. This decision aligns with the principles established in HCA 1617/2016, ensuring that misrepresentations and breaches of contract are adequately addressed, while also taking into account the unique circumstances of the current case, such as the immediate operational failures of the business assets.

Therefore, the court should allow Cissy to rescind the contract and recover her initial payment, as this would promote fairness, uphold contractual integrity, and maintain consistency with legal precedents. This decision is justified because it addresses the misrepresentations and breaches, ensuring that Peter does not benefit from his misrepresentations, and places Cissy in the position she would have been in had the misrepresentations not occurred.
