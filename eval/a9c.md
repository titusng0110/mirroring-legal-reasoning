### Legal Analysis of the Scenario

#### 1. Identification of Legal Issues

The scenario presents several potential legal issues related to the acquisition of Island Ice by Ms. Cissy Cheung from Mr. Peter Pang:

1. **Misrepresentation**: Whether Peter made any misrepresentations about the state of the business, the ice-making machines, the lorries, and the financial health of the company.
2. **Implied Terms**: Whether there are any implied terms in the contract regarding the quality and fitness of the goods (ice-making machines and lorries) and the accuracy of the financial statements.
3. **Breach of Contract**: Whether the issues with the lorries and ice-making machines constitute a breach of contract.
4. **Remedies**: What remedies are available to Cissy, including rescission of the contract, damages, or specific performance.

#### 2. Applicable Laws

The following laws and legal principles are applicable to the scenario:

1. **Misrepresentation Ordinance (Cap. 284)**: Governs the remedies available for misrepresentation.
2. **Sale of Goods Ordinance (Cap. 26)**: Provides for implied terms in contracts for the sale of goods, including conditions as to quality and fitness.
3. **Common Law Principles**: Relating to breach of contract and remedies such as damages and specific performance.

#### 3. Application of Law to Facts

##### Misrepresentation

**Types of Misrepresentation**:
- **Fraudulent Misrepresentation**: A false statement made knowingly, or without belief in its truth, or recklessly.
- **Negligent Misrepresentation**: A false statement made carelessly or without reasonable grounds for believing its truth.
- **Innocent Misrepresentation**: A false statement made without fault.

**Relevant Facts**:
- Peter stated that the ice-making machines had been upgraded and required a tune-up every six months. However, the machines were misconfigured.
- Peter described the lorries as “seasoned and trusty” and “110% reliable” but omitted that they were last serviced in 2015.
- Peter showed audited accounts showing a profit of $6 million but omitted to mention the impact of the pandemic on current financials.

**Legal Analysis**:
- **Ice-Making Machines**: Peter’s statement about the machines being recently upgraded and requiring tune-ups every six months could be considered a negligent misrepresentation if he did not verify the accuracy of the upgrade.
- **Lorries**: Peter’s description of the lorries as “110% reliable” could be seen as a misrepresentation, especially given the lack of recent servicing.
- **Financial Statements**: The omission of the impact of the pandemic on current financials could be considered a misrepresentation if it was material to Cissy’s decision to purchase.

Under the Misrepresentation Ordinance (Cap. 284), Cissy may seek rescission of the contract or damages for any loss suffered due to the misrepresentation.

##### Implied Terms

**Sale of Goods Ordinance (Cap. 26)**:
- **Section 14**: Implied undertaking as to title.
- **Section 16**: Implied undertakings as to quality or fitness.
- **Section 15**: Sale by description.

**Relevant Facts**:
- The ice-making machines and lorries were part of the inventory list attached to the contract.
- The lorries were last serviced in 2015, and one lorry burst into flames.
- The ice-making machines were misconfigured and required extensive repairs.

**Legal Analysis**:
- **Quality and Fitness**: Under Section 16 of the Sale of Goods Ordinance, there is an implied condition that goods sold in the course of business are of merchantable quality and fit for the purpose for which they are bought. The lorries and ice-making machines failing shortly after the sale could breach this implied term.
- **Description**: Under Section 15, the goods must correspond with the description. The lorries and machines not being in the described condition could constitute a breach of this implied term.

##### Breach of Contract

**Relevant Facts**:
- The lorry’s refrigeration unit malfunctioned and burst into flames.
- The ice-making machines ground to a halt and required six months for repair.

**Legal Analysis**:
- The failure of the lorry and ice-making machines could be seen as a breach of the contract, particularly if the implied terms regarding quality and fitness are considered breached.

##### Remedies

**Rescission**:
- Cissy may seek to rescind the contract under the Misrepresentation Ordinance if the misrepresentations are found to be material and induced her to enter the contract.

**Damages**:
- Under Section 3 of the Misrepresentation Ordinance, Cissy may claim damages for any loss suffered due to the misrepresentation.
- Under the Sale of Goods Ordinance, Cissy may claim damages for breach of the implied terms regarding quality and fitness.

**Specific Performance**:
- Specific performance is unlikely to be a suitable remedy given the nature of the defects and the need for extensive repairs.

#### Conclusion

Cissy has several legal options:

1. **Rescission**: She can seek to rescind the contract based on the misrepresentations made by Peter.
2. **Damages**: She can claim damages for the losses suffered due to the misrepresentations and breach of implied terms.
3. **Breach of Contract**: She can claim damages for the breach of contract due to the failure of the lorries and ice-making machines.

Cissy should consult with a legal professional to assess the strength of her claims and the best course of action based on the specific facts and evidence available.
