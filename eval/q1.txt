Gabrielle and Zolt have engaged Pyrotechnics Ltd to refurbish their Texan-themed Flame Bar and Grill, Gabrizo in London. Pyrotechnics Ltd quoted £80,000 for the project. A sum of £40,000 has been paid as a deposit. After the refurbishment began it became apparent that the drains needed to be relocated as they infringed current building regulations. Pyrotechnics Ltd said the additional work would cost £5,000 and would add three weeks on to the completion date. Gabrielle and Zolt were keen to open on time and said they would pay a bonus to Pyrotechnics Ltd of £3,000 if the work stayed on schedule. Pyrotechnics Ltd reschedule other work and pay their staff overtime to work the weekends. Gabrizo opens on time. Gabrielle pays Pyrotechnics Ltd £40,000, as the balance owed on the original agreement. She informs Pyrotechnics Ltd that Zolt has left the country and no one knows his whereabouts. She says the £40,000 must be taken in full and final settlement as she cannot afford the bonus as she is now trading alone and the additional £5,000 for the works on the drain should be absorbed by Pyrotechnics Ltd as it was part and parcel of the original project quoted for in the £80,000. Pyrotechnics Ltd reluctantly agree to take the £40,000 in full and final settlement of the debt as they are being pressed by their own creditors. Pyrotechnics Ltd have since heard that Zolt and Gabrielle are opening Gabrizo 2 in Oxford. Advise Pyrotechnics Ltd as to whether or not they can bring an action to recover the £5,000 for the work on the drains and the promised bonus of £3,000.
