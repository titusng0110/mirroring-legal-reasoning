Jack and Imogen have booked a table at the Blue Parrot restaurant. They are greeted by Wilf the head waiter. Imogen leaves the group. While she is gone Wilf tells Jack that the restaurant is named after the owner’s pet bird which escaped that afternoon. He tells Jack that the owners are offering a £1,000 reward for information leading to its recovery. Posters have been put up to that effect on lamp posts and trees in the area. Once seated Imogen tells Jack about a parrot she found locked in her greenhouse. She says she was late for her date with Jack and has not reported her find to anyone. Jack tells her not to worry and that he will report it for her. Jack leaves the table, gives Wilf Imogen’s address, his name for the reward cheque, and a time at which to collect the parrot. Jack informs Imogen that he has arranged for the bird’s collection. On the way home Imogen sees one of the posters offering the reward. Imogen is furious with Jack as he had not mentioned the reward and she says that at least half if not all the reward money should be hers. Later that evening the parrot’s owners turn up at Imogen’s house. The owners refuse to pay Jack as they feel he did nothing towards the recovery of the bird. They thank Imogen for her help, but say that as she did not know of the reward she cannot be entitled to it. Advise Imogen and Jack whether they have any legal claim to the reward money offered.
