Logoplat Ltd design plates. Ten thousand dining plates with a ‘Le Chat Noir’ design on the side have been produced. On 1 May at 9.00 a.m. Logoplat Ltd post a note on their website indicating that ‘Le Chat Noir’ plates are for sale at a price of £1.00 per plate. Sebastian, owner of Le Chat Noir restaurant, sees the advertisement. He emails Logoplat Ltd at 10.00 a.m. on 1 May asking to have 500 of the plates at £1.00 per plate or 2,000 at 50p per plate. Logoplat Ltd reply at 10.05 a.m. saying that they will sell 2,000 at 70p per plate. Sebastian drafts an email at 11.30 a.m. confirming the order for 2,000 plates at 70p. When he presses ‘send’ he is not connected to the internet. As a result his email is stored in his outbox and sent the following morning, 2 May, at 10.30. The Black Swan Brewery Ltd wants the whole consignment of plates for the launch of their new ‘Le Chat Noir’ beer. They send a van to the premises of Logoplat Ltd with enough cash to pay at £1 per plate. The van arrives at 4.00 p.m. on 1 May and the plates are loaded and sent on their way by 4.30 p.m. At 4.54 p.m. Logoplat Ltd email Sebastian withdrawing their offer. Sebastian reads the email at 10.30 a.m. on 2 May when he logs back onto the internet. Advise Logoplat Ltd as Sebastian is claiming that the rules on offer and acceptance mean that an enforceable contract was formed with him prior to the plates being sold to the Black Swan Brewery Ltd.
