Lillabeth places the following advertisement in the local paper: For Sale: Artists’ Refuge Café, turnover of £100,000 p.a. Includes resident artists’ rented work spaces. The café is situated in the picturesque hamlet of Little Butte, on the main tourist route between Stonehenge and the historic city of Bath. Rufus is interested in purchasing the café. He is not interested in the rental income from the artists as he will use this space for additional seating, but does want to continue selling their work. Rufus visits the premises. The café is crowded with tourists but the outside space is empty. He asks Lillabeth how much of the £100,000 turnover is down to the café business, the art sales, and rentals. Lillabeth tells him that £65,000 of the income is derived from the café sales, £30,000 from art sales and £5,000 from rentals. Lillabeth invites Rufus to see her account books which are stored in an outhouse. He goes with Lillabeth but decides he will take her word for it as the books are covered in mouse droppings and the outhouse is very dirty. Lillabeth has not told Rufus that ‘her artists’ have all now hired space in the local village hall. They still buy food and drink from Lillabeth and supply her with their work. Between seeing the café and signing the contract the planned bypass has been built around Little Butte. This has caused a substantial fall in the amount of passing trade. Rufus also finds out that the total turnover of the business had never been more than £50,000. Advise Rufus whether he has any potential claim against Lillabeth on the grounds of misrepresentation.
