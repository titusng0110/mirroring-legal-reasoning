Following the death of her estranged father, Felicity has inherited his artist’s studio and some of what she believes to be his completed works. Felicity’s father, ‘Clarky’, worked in stained glass and his work was considered radical and progressive in the 1960s, particularly among ‘A’ list celebrities of the time. Unfortunately, owing to the fragility of the work, not much has survived to the present day. His recent death and the originality of his creations have rendered Clarky’s work very valuable. Felicity invites Reah to have a look round with a view to purchasing any items she may be interested in. She sees a large panel depicting a dragon. She offers Felicity £50,000 for the piece. Felicity accepts her offer and will deliver on receiving payment in her bank. Reah immediately goes to her insurers to secure adequate cover in the event of an accident. The specialist valuer tells her that what she has is probably work done jointly by Clarky’s evening beginner class students whom he would provide with a template of a dragon to fill in, to demonstrate and learn technique. Although attractive, the piece would at most be worth £5,000. Reah is very upset and wants to know whether she has to proceed with the contract, as she has not bought what she thought she was buying. Advise Reah as to the application of the doctrine of mistake.
