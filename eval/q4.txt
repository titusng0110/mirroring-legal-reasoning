LN Ltd manufactures nail polish. They have just secured a lucrative contract with a multinational chain of spa hotels. They contracted with Baltimore & McNulty Ltd to use their new computerised transit system which will ensure that deliveries can be fast-tracked around the world, preceded by electronic paperwork, eradicating delays at customs borders. The Adminstrative Dock Workers’ Union have been stopping goods operating on this system and only allowing them on their onward journey when the owner pays the equivalent of an administrator’s monthly salary. This has cost LN Ltd £30,000 in the last three months. LN Ltd was aware that this was a wrongful interference with goods and the action unlawful but felt powerless to resist until the strike was over. LN Ltd use nitrocellulose which is highly inflammable. It is delivered by DSTR Ltd under a four-year contract, with no price variation clause. Insurance costs have risen over 20 per cent in the last six months. For a hazardous load this is an increase of £1,000 per load. Hearing of LN Ltd’s good fortune, DSTR Ltd demand an increase in their haulage rates of 20 per cent with immediate effect, otherwise they would cease delivery forthwith. LN Ltd reluctantly agreed and pay £50,000 before they could find an alternative carrier. Gloop plc provides the pigment for the nail polish. This ingredient now has to be approved by the US Food and Drugs Administration as well as the UK and EU agencies before the point of manufacture. Gloop plc feels that LN Ltd should pay £5,000 per annum to cover the costs of the testing. Unless they agree to do so, Gloop plc has said it will cease to offer credit on any orders. Advise LN Ltd whether the monies paid to the Union and DSTR Ltd can be recovered and whether they are bound to Gloop plc to pay for testing.
