Jessica is converting an old mill into a tea shop and private residence. Lawrence has agreed to do the conversion for the price of £100,000 payable on completion. Lawrence completes the work on the private residence but has walked off site as he has a more lucrative contract elsewhere. He claims Jessica owes him £40,000 for the work done on the residential part of the project. Jessica engages Chris to complete the work on the teashop at a price of £40,000. Chris completes the work. Jessica refuses to pay as she claims the work is shoddy; the doors to the kitchen open inwards instead of outwards; and the shop counter slopes. The cost to remedy the defects is £500. Luke has been hired, at a price of £1,000, to produce a website advertising the teashop and detailing the history of the building. Luke has begun research and has sourced various pieces of archive film and photographs of the mill’s operation. Luke intends to showcase the work to gain other similar commissions. He is bitterly disappointed when Jessica calls him to cancel the contract. He decides to complete the work regardless of Jessica’s wishes and bills her for the £1,000. Jessica has ordered 60 1.2 litre teapots with basket infusers from PoTe Ltd. These are delivered but have a 1.3 litre capacity and, as such, do not match the description on the website or order form. Jessica refuses to accept delivery for this reason. Jessica has managed to source a better deal on teapots linked to a regular discounted supply of teas from T2U Ltd. Advise Jessica as to any contractual liability she may have to Lawrence, Chris, Luke and PoTe Ltd.
