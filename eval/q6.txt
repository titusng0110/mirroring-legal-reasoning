The Hamilton Flyer is a steam train which does tourist trips between Keithley and Oxmoor stations on the Yorkshire Dales Railway between March and September each year. Luke is a steam engine restorer. He has been working on the Hamilton Flyer since September 2014. The work is almost complete when the whole train is destroyed in an explosion which also damages nearby buildings. No fault is attributable to any party and the contract is silent on the issue of risk and damage. Luke has spent £5,000 working on the train prior to the train’s destruction. He was due to be paid £8,000 on completion of the work. The Hamilton Flyer service will be replaced by the Selby Miner, a former coal freight train which has been adapted for passengers by the fitting of wooden seats and a canopy. Peter’s father drove the Hamilton Flyer for over 40 years. To celebrate his 90th birthday Peter has booked seats on the Hamilton Flyer for ten close family and friends, predominantly so that he can relive the trips he made with his father. He was also told that he would be able to ride part of the way in the driver’s seat. Peter has paid for all the tickets in advance, a total of £100. Advise Luke and Peter as to whether or not the doctrine of frustration would discharge their contracts with the Yorkshire Dales Railway and whether any monies paid or payable could be recovered.
