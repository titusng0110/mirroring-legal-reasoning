Sally is the proprietor of the Zen Garden Centre. She has placed an order for 1,000 plaster meerkat garden ornaments from Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd at a cost of £2,000. She has been selling these ornaments for £4 each. Paul’s Pots and Plants Ltd are unable to fulfil the latest order. Sally immediately contacts Bernard who says that in return for a 10 per cent commission he will try to find an alternative supply. He does this within a day at a price of £1 per unit. Sally pays the new supplier £1,000 for the meerkats and Bernard £100 in commission. Sally has commissioned Nicky to landscape her private water garden at a total cost of £12,000. The height of the waterfall features was specified to obtain the maximum ‘splash and burble effect’. The drop is six inches less than in the contractual specification. Only with scientific measuring equipment can the difference in ‘splash and burble’ be detected. The cost of putting the waterfall features right would be £20,000. Sally’s son Owen is to marry a famous actress. At the wedding a local photographer, Peter, has been hired. In his contract it specifies that all rights to the photographs remain with Sally. Peter made copies of the photographs and sold them for £10,000 to a national newspaper. Sally had lined up negotiations with a glossy magazine for an exclusive run with the photographs for around £20,000. They are no longer interested as the photographs are now old news. Advise Sally as to the principles applied in assessing the amount of damages which may be awarded to her as the innocent party to the breaches of contract committed by Paul’s Pots Ltd, Nicky and Peter.
